She said Depp was out of the country at the time.   A security guard at the building, Alejandro Romero, said that Musk had visited Heard at the penthouse \u0027several times a week\u0027 before the alleged incident. Musk has maintained that his relationship with Heard didn\u0027t begin until after she orced Depp.          In the most recent round of the former couple\u0027s seemingly endless court battle, Depp accused Heard of cheating on him with Elon Musk throughout the majority of their marriage. Musk has maintained that his relationship with Heard didn\u0027t begin until after she orced Depp. The couple are pictured together in April 2017 \u0027Elon and Amber didn\u0027t start seeing each other until May 2016, and even then it was infrequent. Their relationship didn\u0027t become romantic until some time later,\u0027 his reps said in a statement. Musk has not publicly responded to Depp\u0027s subpoena and it is unclear if he intends to comply. The tech billionaire and the actress were first romantically linked in July 2016, about a month before Heard\u0027s orce was finalized.  Musk and Heard split in August 2017, citing their busy schedules, and rekindled their relationship in January 2018 before breaking up a second time a month later.  Depp has alleged that Heard and Musk began seeing each other much earlier, about a month after their 2015 wedding.  Heard hopes to defeat Depp\u0027s defamation lawsuit by proving her allegations that her ex-husband is an alcoholic with drug problems who routinely kicked her, beat her and, at times, was so violent that she lost consciousness. Depp denied those allegations and insisted that Heard was the violent one in their relationship, claiming that he needed to have his finger surgically reattached after she hurled a vodka bottle at him. Heard\u0027s lawyers have asked the judge to keep the entire case under seal because, she says, she does not want private details of their friends and families\u0027 lives to become public which they inevitably will if they are submitted as part of the record.  Depp, however, says he has nothing to hide and wants to hash the entire thing out publicly. Johnny Depp: A Star in Crisis and the Insane Story of His \u0026quotMissing\u0026quot Millions | Hollywood Reporter"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/07/4B98BE6400000578-0-image-a-46_1524811986796.jpg","title":"Couple slam wedding photographer Photoshopped images make look thinner","story":"Share this article But when they received the photos, Mrs Leathwick was disappointed to see that they had been edited. She explained: \u0027The first thing I noticed was, I looked a lot slimmer.

His eyebrows are millipedes. Then Lucian in 1943, big-eared, gawky, oddly calm, a white feather in his hand.With each work in this exhibition of Freud’s self-portraits we witness an increasing occupation with his own portrayal, the person moving in and taking up residence in his own unstable image – the one he’s been given and the one he’s making for himself. Sometimes we see Freud in glimpses, or peering round a corner, uneasy but knowing. Then he’s hanging about by a streetlamp, beside a wall surrounding a big house. I hear a lonesome harmonica, and imagine him reaching into his pocket for a packet of Strand cigarettes. (“You’re never alone with a Strand,” the advert went.)Open-mouthed and surprised, he draws himself with soft black crayon and pencil in a deceptively plain 1948 image. The caption talks about some Rembrandt etchings from 1630 and Courbet’s 1843 self-portrait The Desperate Man. Instead, I see a young man wide-eyed in orgasm, his head tilted slightly back, the chin closer to us than his forehead. Who’s on top? Is anybody there? There is shading around the edge of his ears and his neck, as if he were pressed against a pillow. Maybe he is imagining what he would look like in that instant to a lover. Behind Freud’s teeth his mouth is a black cavern that could swallow the world. I imagine it going all the way down, but maybe that’s just me.Once, he’s only a shadow, cast on the bed where his model lies naked. Like a stain or trace evidence, this looming, enlarged patch of grey on the sheet almost isn’t there, while everything else in the painting is solid the woman on the bed is raw and fleshy. This shadow puts us in the painter’s place, hovering invisible over a naked woman. It looks like a movie murder scene I think of Sickert and of Alfred Hitchcock’s Frenzy. A section of this exhibition is devoted to works in which Freud’s own presence is secondary: a pair of small self-portraits sit at the bottom of a wall in the background to his portrait of two Irishmen in their suits. My eye wanders past and out of the window in the background to the open-skied views of west London’s stuccoed streets and tower blocks beyond. Is he misdirecting us?These glimpses are always more than incidental, even when all we see are Freud’s pacing shoes beyond his sitter, caught in the studio mirror as he turns between the canvas and his model. You think you hear the sound of his feet. And then you see a bit of his leg, reflected dim in the night-time window between the blind and the sill, as his son Freddy, naked and stark, stands in the corner of the room.Sometimes he is cropped and sometimes he is unfinished, his face petering out into smears and lost brushstrokes. In their way, these false starts are as complete as any portrait gets. He is always beginning again. “When I see photographs of painters staring into the distance I always think, ‘What complete cunts. I don’t want to be one of those,’” Freud once remarked. I don’t think he wanted to be one of those painters who portray themselves all constipated and brow-furrowing, smug and supercilious, either. Even when he is at the centre of things, he’s unknowable.Freud is a great self-dramatist, and seems to take pleasure catching snatches of himself in mirrors, peering between the foliage of a potted plant, looming and menacing like a 1960s London gangster, then suave and louche, or a sly old git, fixing us from the corner of his eye with a horrible knowing glance as he passes by. Life, like painting, is a kind of self-invention, but along the way things intervene. Shit happens to us and around us, in paintings as well as life. Accidents and mistakes pile up – just like that thick, granular and poisonous lead-white Freud used in his later work. The mistakes and accidents include other people, their presence and affect as they pass through the studio. Their bodies, clothed or naked, are always in the way.Hell isn’t only other people. One must include oneself and one’s body in this comedy of errors and terrors and that’s what Freud does. Then, later, naked in the studio, he raises his palette knife aloft with a kind of comic defiance. Along with the sallow, sagging skin, he is a mess of revisions and repaintings, the pigment piling up and moiling over his cock and balls, the face redone and done again, the room emptying out behind him. It is only him there now.Freud may have resisted his grandfather Sigmund’s influence on his own paintings, but both worked in self-consciously contrived stage-set rooms where other people come and go, leave and return and have secrets to tell. In Freud’s paintings the secrets are the one’s the body tells, rather than the things they say. How complicated, how fascinating it all is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e068e1e5bf612c027129cbbfde700590b928825/0_107_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14cfd0d054f2baf0ec49393ea81e0390","title":"bernardine evaristo doubles lifetime sales in five days after joint booker win","story":"Almost 6,000 copies of Girl, Woman, Other sold in the week after Evaristo’s win alongside Margaret AtwoodBernadine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other more than doubled its lifetime sales in the week following its Booker prize win, with joint winner The Testaments by Margaret Atwood also flying off bookshop shelves.This puts Evaristo in seventh place in this week’s hardback fiction chart, behind Atwood’s already-bestselling follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale. The Testaments sits in third place after selling 13,400 copies following the prize win, adding to its lifetime sales of 191,108.Waterstones fiction buyer Bea Carvalho said that there had been “sales uplift for both titles” following the controversial joint Booker win, but it was Girl, Woman, Other that has seen the greatest spike. “We have also enjoyed an uplift for some of Evaristo’s backlist, and look forward to building on this further,” she said.Chair of judges Peter Florence announced last week that the panel of five judges had been unable to settle on a winner for the £50,000 prize, and instead – against the rules of the institution and the advice of its literary director – had decided to split it. “The more we talked about them, the more we treasured both of them and wanted them both as winners … We couldn’t separate them,” he said.A chorus of mounting criticism followed, over the fact that the first black woman to win the Booker has to share it, and over fears that Atwood’s celebrity could overshadow Evaristo’s win.Readers expressed frustration with the lack of copies of Girl, Woman, Other on display in some bookshops, with some sharing images of tables stacked high with The Testaments and only a few copies of Girl, Woman, Other alongside. On Twitter, former children’s laureate Malorie Blackman wrote: “This makes me sad. This makes me tired. I’ve seen other bookshops display only Margaret Atwood’s book as winner of the Booker Prize. Do better.”One Twitter user, Liz Whitehouse, showed Waterstones Liverpool with a big table of The Testaments under the banner “winner”, with no sign of Evaristo’s book. “No mention on the sign, or on ANY surrounding table on the upstairs displays, and a tiny display downstairs overshone and tiny in front of a HUGE Testaments display. Pretty disgraceful,” she wrote.Carvalho said copies of Girl, Woman, Other had sold out in most Waterstones branches “very quickly” after the announcement, while most shops still had many copies of The Testaments following the significant publicity around its launch in late September.Evaristo’s publisher, Hamish Hamilton, rushed through a reprint of 90,000 copies of the novel following its win, and praised “the outpouring of love and support from booksellers all over the country” that it has received. Stock reached most Waterstones branches by the weekend, Carvalho said, adding that sales of Evaristo’s book exceeded those of The Testaments on Saturday across the chain.

The next threshold would be set between 500,000 and 800,000.The regulator may also demand that suppliers write a “living will” that sets out how they would continue to provide customers with a good service as well as an “orderly exit” if it cannot survive in the market.Mary Starks, an executive director at Ofgem, said the plans would create more accountability in the energy market and reduce the risk and cost of further collapses.The tougher standards for existing energy providers follow proposals to raise entry requirements for new suppliers to stem the rise of unsustainable firms.The regulator encouraged a large number of startups to enter the market to increase competition and drive better customer service. However, it exposed customers to a raft of unsustainable energy suppliers, many of which gave poor customer service before going bust.Fourteen suppliers have crashed out of the market since January 2018. In August, thousands of homes and hundreds of companies were left without an energy provider when Solarplicity collapsed.Matt Vickers, the chief executive of Ombudsman Services, said the crackdown was good news for consumers. He said he supported Ofgem’s plans because there had been spikes in complaints about fast-growing energy companies that were unprepared for rapid growth.Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the proposals would limit the cost to consumers of failed suppliers and provide better protection.“Our research estimates that recent supplier failures led to an additional £172m being added to bills. Most of these costs arose from companies leaving behind unpaid industry bills for renewable schemes,” she said.“The government should legislate to require suppliers make these payments more regularly, and further limit the costs to consumers when these companies fail.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e049f0983d1c7e8a25fa8d0e0a2a3dcf7be4109/0_211_2996_1798/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71deecec9a11bff998640ae439eedc7","title":"how prosus became one of the worlds most valuable companies","story":"Once a newspaper empire that backed apartheid, it now has interests across the globeThe bid for Just Eat by Prosus is the latest in a string of tech bets which have transformed an old newspaper empire into one of the world’s most forward-looking and valuable companies.Prosus, which became Europe’s biggest listed consumer internet firm when it floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange at a valuation of more than €100bn in September, is controlled by Naspers, one of Africa’s most valuable companies which also owns South African media empire Media24 and online retailer Takealot.Founded in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in 1915 to produce a Dutch language newspaper, Naspers moved into book publishing in the 1960s and pay TV in the 1980s.Its newspaper titles, including Afrikaans title Die Burger, backed apartheid – with Media24 only issuing a formal apology in 2015 for its role as a propaganda tool.The group took its first step into the digital world in 1997 with the founding of MWeb, a pay TV channel.That bet has made chairman Koos Bekker, who joined Naspers in 1985, fabulously rich.

Then I met her. She was in leather trousers, fag in one hand, scotch in the other, with a huge dog.Effortlessly cool. Absolutely singular. We became lifelong friends. I informed her I was a feminist and she said she had never heard anyone say that before. We would argue about that over the years, but whatever she identified as, it didn’t matter to me. She broke conventions and boundaries as easily as others breathe, doing things in her inimitable Deborah way. Scary. Thrilling. Shocking.She once head-butted an ex of mine when I wasn’t there out of some misguided loyalty and then phoned me, shouting at me angrily because she’d given herself a bruise on her forehead. Men were scared of her but also absolutely compelled by her. She was gorgeous. Even ill in hospital a few weeks ago her friend Tanya described her as “shimmeringly beautiful”.We could have been competitors, but something much more magnificent happened: we become co-conspirators. My success was her success, hers was mine, but in our early days at this newspaper no women were on the comment pages and no woman had edited the Weekend .She was the first. And she became simply the most brilliant editor I ever had. Her instinct was mesmerising. She just knew stuff. I began to understand her incredible visual sense. She could design, she could draw, she could just see the world in a way no one else could. Her house and stunning garden were a testament to that. When I first used to go round to her flat in Brixton there were incredible mosaics that she had made – but we still had to eat tinned potatoes with ketchup as she insisted that was a nice dinner.God was she difficult, though, and I won’t pretend otherwise. She would turn up at dinner parties with a bottle of whisky, drink it and berate the host. Yet she had a heart the size of Scotland. Infinite kindness and generosity. When a man managed to bleed on my ceiling putting up blinds, she came round, sorted it out, then decided to strip the fireplace.She also read nonstop. I never understood how she could read so much or how she understood plot so well. When we took the kids to see Derren Brown she worked out how he did it. What a mind!It’s funny to think I read some Andrea Dworkin at her wedding, but I did, and I was with her for the birth of her beloved Ivan. Luther came a few years later and has inherited her artistic gifts. She totally adored Maddy and Lexi, her wonderful stepchildren. Her refusal to be quiet for the sake of the kids about the hostility between her and her ex-husband was typical Deborah. Her brave, hard-won, often unpalatable honesty was at times difficult for all concerned.Her voice would not be silenced then and it won’t be now as she left a magnificent memoir behind: Motherwell. I read it and called her “My Brilliant Friend” as she loved Elena Ferrante. When she was irritated with me as I tried to talk about “arrangements” as she was so ill, she would sign off “Your Thick Pal”.She also told me I was the crappest smoker she knew.The only person I ever saw get the better of Deborah was my then 11-year-old in a row about which restaurant we went to on holiday in Jerusalem. As usual Deborah went hammer and tongs for it, had a drink, backed down and then danced for four hours in the hotel disco constantly telling us how much she loved us.So many times I have tried to get her off the dancefloor. And failed. It’s always a marathon. To see her lost in music was a joy. We went mad to Burning Down the House when we went to see David Byrne last year. She turned to me and said: “I think that may have been the best three minutes of my life.”All her writing is there now for you to savour. It is full of empathy, nuance and humanity: the polar opposite of so many other formulaic, partisan columns. Motherwell, her memoir, is piercing in its insight and forgiveness. You just want the next book. Well, I just want more of her full stop, in her velvet swish. I want more of her withering put-downs, another lunch that turns into dinner and then why not go dancing?One time we were getting on a plane from India and she was going straight from the airport into the office. She was wearing a bikini and tiny sarong. “Are you gonna wear … you know, clothes?” I asked her. “Ach,” she said. “Relax Suze.”In the days before her death, I told her to relax. She was alive through sheer strength of will and wanted so much to be with her boys by the sea. As it so happens I knew when to be there, though I had expected the last message from her to be “Why don’t you fuck off?”. I have had a few of those for being an interfering cow.Deborah ill was still the essence of Deborah. Actually the last text was: “You are Saturday to me. And my Friday night.” I am so very glad I was there to tell her stories, all of them true, about all our crazy times. I am writing this by the light of the beautiful lamp she gave me. She had the best taste of anyone I have ever met.Oh Deborah. In all her complicated glory she was wild. Untamed. Never not true to herself. “Who among us can say that?” I asked her in the ever-changing light of the big Brighton sky, as the sun glinted on the sea and I saw the small boat out on the horizon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/798316854ef3c2f275853ee3098ccc8ef2f67af6/0_169_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0bf0c14930375810a099f0b75f51189","title":"operation yellowhammer brexit preparations","story":"The many thousands of civil servants who, like me, work on no-deal Brexit preparations know that Twitter is increasingly a more reliable guide to what’s about to go down than anything our bamboozled civil service bosses pass on to us. This is partly the result of a prime minister whose showmanship has turned zombie and started gorging itself on our institutions, and partly the result of the fact that we just can’t seem to get enough of it. The conventions of political theatre – not proper risk management – are now ensorcelling hundreds more staff into Operation Yellowhammer, the government’s planning for a no-deal Brexit, as Michael Gove so portentously announced to Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday.The official reason we are given for this new phase is that the UK, thanks to its self-hating parliament, can’t be sure that the EU will grant a Brexit extension, thus making no deal more likely. But the real reason, of course, is to help to terrify craven MPs into voting for the deal by carrying out a pre-Halloween dress rehearsal of what no deal will actually feel like.There’s been plenty of martial metaphor used in relation to Brexit. It’s not exaggerated, Whitehall is already under siege: there have been bunkered ministerial meetings of the high-level exit operations committee, the scaling up of “operation centres”, and civil servants being “deployed” like paratroopers into enemy territory.Ahead of yet another momentous week, my nerves are shot. Already this week, our team meetings have been led by sanguine but hollow-eyed senior civil servants who are (often in the same breath as reminding us to look after our mental health) instructing us – Blackadder-style – to go over the top. I slump in no-deal risk management meetings wondering when we will ever be brave enough to name the real risks to our sanity, never mind to the country.Much of this Yellowhammer shtick is just for show. As a civil servant I’m angry about that – and so should you be. There’s a risk, though, of anger giving way to boredom. Even this week, the prime minister is counting on MPs just being too bored to scrutinise the dense legalese of the 110-page withdrawal agreement bill within three backbreaking days. They are, understandably, pushing back against being bounced into glossing over the fine print. And why not, when this kind of cynical expediency at any other critical juncture would horrify most people? Heaven help us if no deal actually happens. Because, even with the best efforts of civil servants like me, Operation Yellowhammer won’t be enough, even with its enormous price tag. Not even close. And while – outrageously – there won’t be any economic analysis prepared by the government on the impact of the new deal, we already know – thanks to Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts – that the impact of no deal will make the £6.3bn spent this year on no-deal planning look like peanuts.Civil servants have to perform their roles neutrally in order to be able to work with whoever is in government. That’s the job. But if I learned one thing from the Extinction Rebellion protesters who occupied most of Whitehall last week it’s that the impact of all of this will make us wish we had all got angrier sooner.• The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and is currently part of Operation Yellowhammer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c10a589a3ecb23b501c7b7132f394bcae25ec45/217_596_2864_1719/master/2864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11948911d27863eff671b4ffea96dfdb","title":"remain identity survive brexit young generation","story":"Among the ‘smashed avocado metro-elite’ is a generation of young people radicalised by BrexitA remainer was once defined as a voter who wanted the UK to stay in the EU. Then the term got looser, scooping up politicians who pledged to fulfil the referendum mandate while failing some other test of Eurosceptic rigour.Even some of the MPs who endorsed Boris Johnson’s deal on Tuesday night, bringing Britain far closer to the Brexit point of no return than it came when Theresa May was in Downing Street, will not qualify for True Leaver status not in the eyes of zealous anti-Brussels puritans.The impure mark of remain is still on those who, moments after proving their Brexiteer credentials, were sensible enough to oppose the government’s preposterously truncated timetable for legislating the deal into force before 31 October.Johnson’s slippery response when the Commons chose not to wield the rubber stamp says as much about his fear of scrutiny as his impatience to meet the extendable Halloween deadline.The prime minister knows that, on close inspection, his deal horrifies anyone with even a trace of attachment to European institutions. It explicitly prohibits negotiation of intimate trade. If a more distant relationship isn’t agreed quickly, a nasty, familiar cliff-edge comes back into view.Yet MPs who balked at those hazards are, in the Brexiteer lexicon, just another brand of remainer, even when some of them nodded through the rest of the package. This is how the Eurosceptic ratchet has worked over two decades, shifting Tory politics from a position where benefits of EU membership were undisputed to a place where belief in those benefits is seditious. The word Eurosceptic used to express wariness of further integration. Now it means someone who is not content to burn bridges but insists on also laying mines and barbed wire around the smouldering stumps.Moderate Tories who enable that process, hoping one day to restore peace in their party, have learned nothing from recent history. The hardliners do not compromise, except as a tactical feint before upgrading their demands. They do not even accept total surrender, which is what a vote by any former remainer for Johnson’s Brexit indicates.They will pursue the defeated side until the very memory of a pro-European Toryism is extinguished. Labour MPs who lend their votes to that endeavour are ignoring a different history lesson – the one where a group of highly motivated, left-leaning voters remember and savagely punish a party that abets the Tories.Europhobic fanaticism has broken the will of some remainers but radicalised the rest. Since Johnson became prime minister, I have felt gloomy about the UK’s future relations with Europe. But Brexiteers’ refusals to be magnanimous in victory and hysterical intolerance of dissent reek of insecurity. Their constant dread of defeat makes me think it is still possible.As a political project, remain has been a sequence of tactical, rearguard successes on a long retreat. MPs have imposed scrutiny when Downing Street wanted secrecy, but crafty procedural manoeuvres have not changed all that many minds in the country. They have been as likely to reinforce leave voters’ suspicions that an impenetrable establishment stitch-up is under way.Outside parliament, the People’s Vote campaign has whipped up demand for a referendum, but that is an expedient to avert Brexit, not an argument why EU membership is worth saving. Many Europhiles find the thought of another bitterly fought plebiscite dispiriting, so they shrink from the policy printed on the banner under which they rally. Charismatic leadership celebrating the pro-European cause on its own terms is no more available now than it was in 2016.The People’s Vote strategy judged that a referendum could only happen if MPs voted for one, and that required endorsement from the official opposition. The whole enterprise got tangled in Labour’s internal politics, marked by factional vendetta and paranoia. It has been hard to make a public argument that the UK belongs in the EU while still privately lobbying sceptics in Jeremy Corbyn’s office for permission to pose the question.Labour’s ambivalence has been a gift to the Liberal Democrats, but Jo Swinson has not asserted her presence on the national stage. Her voice might carry further in a general election. It could also be drowned out by the traditional collusion of Labour and Tory campaigns to present the ballot as a binary choice.Still, the two main parties will not find it easy simply to partition the remainer vote, even if the ballot comes after the UK has left the EU. Corbyn and Johnson would both like to shunt the conversation on to other matters, and there is a receptive audience for politics that isn’t about Brexit.But there are also forces that will keep pushing Europe back up the agenda. Tory leavers will not let it lie. Already they mutter about “securing Brexit”, by which they mean sustaining momentum through a transition period, hurtling towards the day of ultimate bridge detonation in December 2020. Their fear is that Labour’s pro-Europeans will escape the debilitation of Corbyn’s leadership and that a refreshed, united opposition will turn remain into rejoin.That anxiety contains the recognition that Johnson’s deal is a sleight of hand. It sets up an interlude of stability in transition (while the UK passively sucks up new EU regulations) before the full impact of a hard Brexit is felt. Leave ideologues have utopian faith that all will come good in the end, but not before a period of job-shredding turbulence. They worry that voters will take fright as the reality of going it alone in a savage global marketplace comes into focus.They should also worry about the cultural dynamics sustaining the anti-Brexit movement. The pro-EU electorate has been poorly served by the main English parties but, paradoxically, that has nurtured attachment to remain as an identity. In the absence of capable political representation, the cause has become a grievance – a lingering burn in the hearts of people who didn’t think about their status as citizens of Europe before 2016, but now resent having that citizenship, and all it represents, withdrawn.It is convenient for Brexiteers to dismiss these people as a metro-elite, snivelling over their crushed avocado on sourdough. But the caricature obscures awkward electoral and demographic facts. Remainers come in all ages, but their numbers swell in younger cohorts. They are more likely to live in cities, but they are spread all over the country. There are millions of them and they vote.These are people who will shape the next generation of British politics and no sane party should be despising and alienating them. The material benefits of Brexit are remote if they exist at all, and the costs high. There will be an instant of gratification for leavers on the day of symbolic escape from Europe, and relief for the bored agnostics. But those feelings will, I suspect, be weak and transient compared with the anguish and loss felt on the other side. Leavers will not thank politicians for Brexit, not with the passion and persistence of the remainers who will punish them for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f009f7dd7c4285ca5850a86921ddace2190608d/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e32b613885ddf266fac4a7b6d722b9b7","title":"second referendum brexit deal thatcher","story":"Hopes for a second referendum on Brexit are receding, as more and more Tories show their true colours and fall in line behind Boris Johnson and his controversial deal. They have passed through all the stages of grief to arrive at acceptance of a Brexit that they know will make Britain poorer and weaker. One of their leading lights, the former home secretary Amber Rudd, explicitly acknowledged that the deal would “hurt the economy” – but she said “it’s the right thing to do because we had a referendum”.Pursuing an economically devastating Brexit is a choice, not a necessity. The referendum was a mandate to change the political basis of our relationship with Europe, not to terminate all our economic cooperation altogether, as envisaged in the new withdrawal agreement. The proposal would give Britain the same economic relationship with the EU as distant countries such as Mexico or Canada. That’s why the extremist interpretation of the 2016 referendum that was begun by Theresa May and accelerated by Johnson can and must be resisted. If that cannot be achieved by a second referendum – even the most ardent campaigners now accept they don’t have the numbers – then it is vital that politicians return to the arena of compromise.The most obvious area for compromise is a customs union. The current proposal will wreak havoc in what’s left of Britain’s manufacturing sector. While manufacturing is a small percentage of the overall economy, it is vital for exports and therefore for competitiveness. Each major manufacturing sector – automotive, aerospace, food and drink, pharmaceuticals and chemicals – have warned that the government’s approach will damage their industries. A customs union would protect industry and jobs.It would also resolve the problems for Northern Ireland. The crucial insight of the Good Friday agreement was that the different communities in Northern Ireland could be united by common means – power-sharing and the democratic determination of their future – even if they sought different ends. Imposing what amounts to a new constitutional settlement on the province plainly violates the essential spirit of the agreement.The second area for compromise is on workers’ rights. Johnson’s plan has removed protections of key rights and standards from the legally binding withdrawal agreement and inserted them into the political declaration, which is no more than a statement of intent. The government has promised it will make a statement to the House whenever EU workers’ rights improve, but it has not promised to match them. Johnson’s deal has been designed precisely to facilitate a race to the bottom. Not a single trade union was prepared to endorse the package.Why would a government that was genuinely committed to workers’ rights erase those very same rights from the legal text of the withdrawal agreement? The purpose is obvious to all but those who choose not to see it. The Tories are salivating at the prospect of a decade of deregulation ahead. The power to deregulate is essential to securing a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump. The obvious compromise is to reinsert the minimal protections that were included in May’s agreement into the new withdrawal agreement. Given the EU has agreed to these in the past, this is plainly an option available to the government should it wish to take it.The final area for compromise concerns the risk that no trade agreement is agreed at the conclusion of the transition period at the end of 2020. Johnson has secured the support of the members of the ERG with an agreement that they regard as merely a pit-stop on the way to a no-deal exit. And even if a deal were to be struck, the promised “parliamentary lock” – a further promise to give MPs control over the future partnership with the EU – is nothing more than a latch. The government has explicitly not promised a “meaningful vote” but rather a “form” of meaningful vote. Why would any MP trust the weasel words of a prime minister who lied to the Queen? No responsible MP should be expected to support a deal that allows Britain to crash out next year.Labour should still press to let the people decide. This moment has strong echoes of Thatcher’s rise to power in 1979: Johnson’s deal enables the assault on working people that took place in the 1980s to be repeated again in the 2020s. The same forces – a hard-right Tory government backed by the Murdoch press – that lined up against working people then have come together again now. It is only right and proper that the public should have the final say about this fundamental choice for Britain’s future.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economics"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af13f8f7332b7ce0d3a219d46f8759b8acdb5d37/26_25_2545_1527/master/2545.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38f28886354c6efccb6c1999eaa4f5ee","title":"the guardian view on the canadian election a win for trudeau but not a triumph","story":"Four years ago, Justin Trudeau promised his country “sunny ways”. This time there was no euphoria simply relief, as the Liberals lost the popular vote but hung on as a minority government, just ahead of their Conservative rivals. It was a victory, but no triumph. This election was Mr Trudeau’s to lose – and he almost did.He rose to power as a young, charismatic idealist, cloaked in the aura of his father Pierre, the long-serving prime minister. He appointed a gender-balanced and racially erse cabinet. While his Conservative predecessor pulled the country out of the Kyoto protocol, he pledged decisive climate action. He welcomed tens of thousands of refugees as others shut their doors. The economy has boomed. His record looked even better when Donald Trump entered the White House.The shine started to come off in 2018 as an official trip to India revived suggestions that he was a lightweight, and the government’s purchase of a pipeline angered those who had cheered his carbon tax scheme. But most Canadian governments manage a second term, and at the start of this year Mr Trudeau still looked unbeatable. Then came the SNC-Lavalin scandal. Even after Canada’s ethics watchdog ruled that Mr Trudeau violated laws by urging his attorney general – the first Indigenous person in the role – to halt the prosecution of an engineering company in a conflict of interest case, he shamefully refused to apologise. Then, weeks before the election, multiple images emerged of him in blackface. Both cases highlighted questions about his record on race and Indigenous issues.His good luck was to face a charmless and uninspiring opposition under a socially conservative leader, Andrew Scheer, who struggled to even formulate his position on abortion and same-sex marriage. Mr Scheer’s vow to scrap the carbon tax cemented Conservative support in the western oil-producing regions, but alienated voters in suburban Ontario who have kept the Liberals in power. Many of the Liberals’ lost seats were taken not by the Conservatives but the Bloc Québécois.The defeat of the Conservatives is good news, not only for Canada but for a world that needs a liberal counterbalance to a rightwing surge, and needs governments that will take action on the climate catastrophe, even if it falls short. The ignominious performance of the far-right People’s Party of Canada, which campaigned against “mass immigration” and ended up with no seats at all, is extremely welcome. Meanwhile, Canada has plenty of experience of minority governments, and their considerable achievements include universal healthcare. The Liberals’ most likely ally is the leftwing New Democratic party, despite its loss of 15 seats. There was little humility or introspection in Mr Trudeau’s speech on election night. But the Liberal win will be all the better if it is accompanied by increased scrutiny of the prime minister and a greater determination to hold him to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90865a23f80ffbb299caab1f179ee8860dea6efa/79_231_5063_3038/master/5063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c904ff5d77f58719d1f222a8b7dd9ed7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of trick","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘trick’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘trick’.Share your photos of what trick means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 23 October at 10am.

Unlike their competitors (the main networks and cable channels), they have never been held to the same standard, never judged by ratings, choosing to keep themselves separate, much to the rest of the industry’s frustration. But over time, a shift has taken place.Slowly but surely, the streaming goliath has started to share viewing data, usually as a brag and only when it shows them in a positive light, but with each shred of information we have started to see the bigger picture. Just last week, we were handed their most revealing dump to date, the 10 most popular original films and shows over the last 12 months, complete with figures for each. While we’re still starved of the bottom end of the list, and disappointingly yet tellingly, any box office data for their theatrical releases, we can start to see what is and isn’t working for the platform.If one were to examine the top 10 theatrically released films over the last year, the upper end, if not the entire list, would be dominated by franchises, sequels and ones that don’t necessarily rely on the names involved. But on Netflix, an underdeveloped alternative to the multiplex, the biggest films more closely resemble the box office hits of the late 80s and early 90s when star appeal was prioritised over spectacle, a period that saw Rain Man, Fatal Attraction, Ghost and Three Men and a Baby win big.The top three most-watched Netflix originals of the last 12 months are Bird Box (80 million viewers), Murder Mystery (73 million) and Triple Frontier (52 million), all broad, crowd-pleasing films sold almost exclusively on stars Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, all of whom are actors who broke out in the 90s boasting fanbases that have mostly stayed loyal ever since. The mixture of recognisable casts, substantial budgets and experienced directors meant that they all looked like actual theatrical releases, too, making their drops feel like mini-events to viewers who might not have been anticipating their release.Inevitably, and ironically, the films that seemed to stand against the ongoing production line of predictable sequels being churned out by the wider industry are all now being envisioned as franchise-starters by those behind them. Murder Mystery 2 has been given the official green light, a follow-up to the Bird Box novel was announced earlier this year, leading many to speculate about an adaptation, while Triple Frontier director JC Chandor has expressed muted interest in a quadruple. Next year also sees sequels to the previous year’s hits The Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.By far, the platform’s biggest TV drop of the year is Stranger Things 3 (64 million viewers), an inevitable result given the frenzy surrounding the series since it began in 2016, but while it’s easy to equate its success to that of a big-screen sequel, especially given both its genre and how it’s been marketed, what’s most interesting is that it’s one of only two shows on the list that isn’t a first season. There’s no sign of Netflix staples like Orange is the New Black, Glow, Bojack Horseman, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, House of Cards, Black Mirror, The Crown, 13 Reasons Why and Mindhunter, and instead viewers have flocked to new shows like The Umbrella Academy (45 million viewers), You (40 million) and Sex Education (32 million), all also notably aimed at a younger audience.It’s a sign that either original shows tend to lose viewers with each season or that Netflix has been algorithmically tweaking its output to fall more closely in line with its most impassioned younger viewers. With all new shows on the list coming back for a second season, it will be interesting to see what next year’s results highlight.Importantly, the lists provided don’t include content acquired by Netflix from elsewhere which would inevitably mean that much-loved sitcoms like Friends and The Office would make an appearance. The success of both (Netflix extended the Friends deal for one final year for $100m before it was snapped up by HBO Max starting 2020) led many to believe that the practice of bingeing was mostly employed by those seeking lighter, snappier fare. But the appearance of two tough, issues-led dramas on Netflix’s TV list suggest that this might not always be the case.In a short amount of time, Unbelievable (32 million viewers) and When They See Us (25 million) have shown there’s a big audience for fact-based shows dealing with difficult, timely topics. Unbelievable, a combination of a dogged crime procedural and a docudrama, focused on rape and how it can be mishandled by authorities while When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Emmy-winning Central Park Five miniseries, dealt with race and how it too often leads to false imprisonment, and both were eagerly consumed by viewers and critics. Expect a major awards push for both in time for the Golden Globes as well as further green lights for equally tough-minded dramas.Genres that have long been cast aside by Hollywood have been carefully and cleverly resuscitated by Netflix for a while now with notable successes, such as 2018’s “Summer of Love” which saw a string of smash-hit romcoms, including Set It Up, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and The Kissing Booth (all of which Netflix has been happy to brag about). In comparison, before Crazy Rich Asians last year, the industry hadn’t seen a $100m romcom hit since 2011’s Just Go With It.The latest top 10 is filled with similar examples with teen movieromcom crossovers The Perfect Date (48 million viewers) and Tall Girl (41 million), psycho-thriller Secret Obsession (40 million), romcom Always Be My Maybe (32 million) and chick flick Otherhood (29 million) all scoring well. Apart from Otherhood, the films mentioned aren’t really star-led but their appeal is more about a tried-and-tested-and-forgotten-about formula being brought back to life. The success of “cheerfully trashy” thriller Secret Obsession, from longtime Hallmark and Lifetime channel director Peter Sullivan, is perhaps the most concerning given its rote plot and flat TV movie direction. It’s a cheap quickie that would usually be chucked on to cable but its large viewership on Netflix will lead to more of the same, a grubby inevitability and looking ahead at their schedule, there are similarly low-rent options in the coming months.The list of most-watched films, from Bird Box down to Fyre (20 million viewers) sees a gap of 60 million viewers, meaning that while some films hit big, there’s a great many that lag far, far behind. This doesn’t make them flops per se but it does mean that genuine phenomena are hard to find. The list also shows that while Netflix has put a great deal of funding into both their awards push and their splashy partnerships with respected auteurs, audiences are less invested in the outcome than they are.The most conspicuous absence is Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, the platform’s most critically acclaimed and awarded film to date. Netflix might have been proud to flaunt its reviews, nominations and eventual wins but they have yet to release any solid data about either its streaming viewership or its limited run at the box office. There’s also no love for the Coen brothers and their anthology western The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Dan Gilroy’s Sundance-premiering art world horror Velvet Buzzsaw, the long-awaited Orson Welles drama The Other Side of the Wind, Paul Greengrass’s grim docudrama 22 July or Steven Soderbergh’s High Flying Bird. Of course, these films would have been unlikely to make the top 10 most-watched films at the cinema, too, but the film list offers a picture of a far less demanding viewer than the TV list and show’s a great discrepancy in the films that Netflix chooses to promote over what viewers choose to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94316c8d9da460325ed4849c2f62b070f2a7a256/0_136_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1a607436abd0e9bb9c926e2fe853f03","title":"its not just students who are to blame for noisy neighbourhoods in bristol","story":"We are a scapegoat for rapid expansion and estate agents’ greed. It’s time for students and local residents to work together “Antisocial behaviour.” “Parties of the worst extremes.” “A continuous festival of noise.” These are just a handful of the descriptions used to characterise neighbourhoods near Bristol University. And who’s being blamed for the change? Students.As a student at the university, I recently moved to one of these areas, Redland. Immediately we found ourselves in the middle of a familiar story of finger-pointing between students and local residents. I now realise that this town vs gown blame culture unfairly targets students, who are convenient scapegoats for understandably frustrated voices.We are considered the main reason for the transformation of residential areas into lively student hubs of antisocial behaviour. But other factors need to be recognised too, such as universities’ rapid expansion and the resultant housing price hikes.This popularity is something to be celebrated, but it has also sent rent prices throughout the city rocketing. The university is struggling to cope with demand: this year students have been housed across the border in Newport, with others in Somerset – a 40-minute drive from their studies.Once students enter their second year and seek private housing, they are strongly guided by estate agents. We are directed, en masse, into the same affordable properties and neighbourhoods that our predecessors occupied, and so the community grows. This shift in the residential demographic is highly sensitive. Students do appreciate this, a fact conveniently misrepresented by the local voices quoted in newspapers. Take my example: last week I hosted welcome drinks for new members of the university sports club before leaving at 9.30pm to relocate to the city centre. I awoke to find a picture of members leaving my house in multiple news articles online, claiming that students “pre-load” on booze before leaving for clubs at midnight. In my case it was untrue, but it’s also the reality that our maintenance loans typically don’t stretch far enough to cover the price of alcohol in pubs and bars.This slew of accusations will get us nowhere. It only poisons the atmosphere between residents and students rather than helping us find compromise. There’s even vindictive talk of some residents clubbing together to plan a party during exam season as revenge. While some students may be inconsiderate, others want to build better relations with neighbours and integrate into the community. Many local residents want the same thing, but in extreme cases our efforts are met with threats of petty parties, constant police reports and pictures of us in critical articles. It seems the stereotype of students as entitled and rowdy is decided long before anyone actually meets us, despite this image only accurately describing a minority.Instead of deciding which student house to point the finger at each night, should we not be going to the universities and council for a solution? Should they not be taking responsibility for the areas that students are encouraged to live in?There is no obvious solution to these questions. However, we need to focus our attention towards minimising this conflict. It’s time to urge universities and the council to provide affordable housing in other areas, rather than punishing all students for the behaviour of a few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

The islands had previously been seen on satellite images but the expedition was the first to see them.It also said it had also confirmed the existence of an island that had been previously mapped as a peninsula of Hall Island, part of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, west of Novaya Zemlya.Moiseyev said names for the new islands were “upcoming”.“Of course each island will receive a name but first you have to lay out the case for it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/655c61aa09e39fbc82e30add9e4bb93e1b028f5d/0_264_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8773301076fa680fea6136653cd84c3","title":"mexico colorado river people left without river","story":"The loss of the Colorado River has destroyed the social fabric of the Cucapá tribe and is partly to blame for its population declineby  Nina Lakhani in El Mayor, Baja California NorteThey are called the River People, but they no longer have a river.Inocencia González is the traditional tribal elder of the Cucapá – the River People – in northern Mexico. She spends her days beading traditional chaquira jewellery to sell at the community museum, and reminiscing about happier times spent fishing for tilapia and mullet.González grew up in the Colorado River delta when the mighty waterway and lakes provided abundant food, water, medicines and spiritual nourishment for her people to thrive.It was on the river that González, now 82, taught her children, just like her parents and grandparents taught her, to fish with canoes and traps made from willow trees which flourished on the riverbanks.Now, the river stops at the US-Mexico border and the lakes are dry and native vegetation is confined to reforestation projects. The only fish come from irrigation canals and the nearby River Hardy – a polluted 16-mile tributary of the Colorado sustained by agricultural runoff and a water treatment plant.As the  reported yesterday, the Colorado is the most regulated waterway in the Americas, supplying water to cities, farmlands and national parks across seven US states. But it is dammed at the international border and the US releases an allotted amount, which is mostly erted into irrigation canals for farmland. The Colorado itself is reduced to puddles, a taunting sight during the summer months when temperatures can reach 50C (122F). “I miss the river, it’s where we come from, it’s who we are,” said González, while chain smoking outside her modest home in El Mayor, Baja California. “Now, everything has changed, the youngsters can’t swim in the river and we’ve no choice but to fish in polluted water.”At home next door, grandson Jaziel Soto Torres, 25, has bandages wrapped around both legs, to cover itchy blisters that erupted after wading in the murky River Hardy to repair a footbridge.The Cucapá are one of Baja California’s five native tribes, and are descended from the hunter gatherer Yuman people who migrated here around 1000BC.In the 1800s, western colonizers documented 5,000 to 6,000 nomadic Cucapás, who organised in clans and followed the turbulent river to fish and cultivate the fertile banks of the Colorado delta.Now, official figures suggest fewer than 400 remain in Mexico and around a thousand in Yuma, Arizona – the Cucapá were among several native tribes ided by the Mexico-US war and 1848 border treaty. The population decline is partially blamed on the demise of the river.Losing the river, argue Cucapá leaders, has destroyed the social fabric of the community: the language is close to extinction, spiritual ceremonies are forgotten, and youngsters are forced to migrate.“People abandoned the community because there’s no river, no fish and no life here. It’s cost us our language, culture and identity,” said Antonia González, Inocencia’s daughter who runs the museum.In Arizona, the tribe, known as the Cocopah, has federally guaranteed rights to water from the Colorado, though there, too, traditional riverine customs and foods have radically declined. El Mayor is a dusty, poor neighborhood founded after scores of riverside households were scattered when the river burst its banks in 1979. US dams, brimming with excessive rainfall and melting snow, had released huge amounts of water, and Mexican flood defences were ill-equipped to cope.The Cucapá were badly affected, and forced to relocate from dispersed rural homesteads to tightly packed neighbourhoods. El Mayor has the biggest diaspora, and conditions remain basic: there is a hodgepodge of improvised houses and old American trailers ided by sandy gravelled roads, barbed-wire fences, and drooping salty pines.The community has been blighted by alcohol and drug abuse, crystal meth in particular, as well as alarming rates of diabetes, asthma and cancer. Roofs provided by the government in 1979 were riddled with asbestos and were left in place for three decades.“We’re not used to living like this, and being so close together has generated jealousies and isions that never existed before. The biggest threat we face is internal conflict,” added Antonia González, who teaches teenagers Cucapá folk stories, dance and songs in an effort to instill traditional values linked to mother nature.Nevertheless, the flood years weren’t all bad, said tribal elder Inocencia. The glut of water meant the river flowed and the Laguna Salada, a vast sandy depression west of El Mayor, filled with freshwater and high tides from the Gulf of California, resulting in plentiful fish.The lagoon dried up when the manmade floods subsided, forcing the Cucapá to start fishing in the open sea for sea bass – known as the croaker for its deafening mating call – which congregate in the Sea of Cortez separating the slender Baja California peninsula from the Mexican mainland, between February and May.It became an economic lifeline for the Cucapá, but croaker stocks are declining as a result of illegal fishing, corruption and the climate crisis, posing yet another threat to the Cucapá.This year, Francisco Javier Gonzales, who runs El Mayor’s only shop, is indebted after failing to recoup the money spent on petrol and equipment for the third consecutive croaker season.But there is some cause for optimism. Conservation efforts, which includes dredging sections of the dry riverbed and reforestation – are helping tidal waves from the gulf encroach further into the river delta to create small, glistening wetlands that attract hungry pelicans and egrets. For the Cucapá, restoring these natural aquatic connections could also help save their way of life.Inés Hurtado, 52, a Cucapá leader, said: “The wetlands bring fish, and the fish are what sustain us. We have to protect them.”To contact Nina Lakhani, the ’s new environmental justice reporter, e-mail nina.lakhani@the."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa7d9b806b30b18c16c8c47d01b156209cecf230/0_278_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d70c3480668b090556469ed7997d854","title":"uk to use 1bn meant for green energy to support fracking in argentina","story":"Documents show government’s plans to use money from £1bn 2017 deal to prioritise support of major oil companiesThe UK is planning to invest in Argentina’s controversial oil shale industry using a £1bn export finance deal intended to support green energy, according to government documents seen by the .UK Export Finance, the government’s foreign credit agency, promised in 2017 to offer loans totalling £1bn to help UK companies export their expertise in “infrastructure, green energy and healthcare” to invest in Argentina’s economy.Instead official records, released through a freedom of information request, have revealed the government’s plan to prioritise support for major oil companies, including Shell and BP, which are fracking in Argentina’s vast Vaca Muerta shale heartlands.One government memo, uncovered by Friends of the Earth, said that while Argentina’s clean energy sector was growing, it was “Argentina’s huge shale resources that offer the greatest potential” for the UK. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,\u0026nbspcalculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from inidual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\u0026nbspAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.The briefing note was prepared before a key meeting between the UK government’s trade envoy to Latin America, the UK ambassador to Argentina and Argentina’s energy minister in February this year.Tony Bosworth, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “With the world hurtling towards catastrophic climate change, and parliament declaring a climate emergency, it’s outrageous that the UK government is continuing to back huge fossil fuel developments abroad.”Separate records, also uncovered by Friends of the Earth, revealed that there had been no fewer than 13 meetings between the UK and oil companies operating in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta hydrocarbon reservoir since the beginning of last year.The companies include Shell, Andina Resources, Phoenix Global Resources and Pan American Energy (PAE), a subsidiary of BP. They have contributed donations amounting to more than £40,000 to fund birthday celebrations for the Queen held at the British embassy in Bueno Aires over the past two years. There have been no meetings with renewable energy companies, according to the records.Argentina has become a magnet for major oil companies after discovering the world’s third largest shale reserves in the world. It hopes to replicate the US energy revolution by encouraging oil companies to exploit the reserves within the Vaca Muerta region despite strong opposition from local communities.A  investigation this month revealed that the fracking industry had already caused irreversible damage to the ancestral homeland of Argentina’s indigenous Mapuche people after an oil fire burned for more than three weeks next to a freshwater lake in Vaca Muerta.Argentina delivered its first-ever export of light crude and liquified natural gas from Vaca Muerta earlier this summer, five years after local community protest was quashed by authorities using teargas and rubber bullets.The UK’s loans to support work in Argentina have been modest to date, but are expected to rise as Argentina’s burgeoning shale industry increases production. One of the largest provisions has been for £346,000 to support the UK company working with BP’s PAE in the 2017-2018 financial year.The government’s plan to support Argentina’s shale industry comes after an investigation revealed an eleven-fold increase in support for fossil fuels over the past year to almost £2bn.The plans are strongly opposed by MPs on the environmental audit committee, which branded the UK’s foreign fossil fuel investments as the “elephant in the room” undermining the UK’s climate leadership.The UK government legislated earlier this year to commit to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, and is preparing to host the UN’s next major climate talks in Glasgow next year. The government’s climate efforts will be led by a new sub-committee within the cabinet office to be headed by the prime minister.Friends of the Earth warned that Boris Johnson must show global leadership ahead of the Glasgow UN summit by putting environmental responsibility and decarbonisation at the heart of every government policy – both at home and abroad.“Boris Johnson’s pledge to lead the world in slashing climate-wrecking pollution will be meaningless if his government continues to back the exploitation of massive oil and gas developments in Argentina,” Bosworth said.A UKEF spokesperson said “The UK has a wide range of economic and commercial interests in Argentina. In support of this UKEF can provide its support for exports on a commercial basis across all sectors it does not ringfence support for a specific industry. UKEF welcomes the opportunity to support all viable UK exports including in the renewables and green growth sectors to Argentina”. UKEF did not offer evidence that it had met any renewable energy developers in Argentina."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399dfc115cc0d5d9d9d140ac885cc05cfca93401/0_97_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44fcc539d5e386fbff529197dec69b4c","title":"naming and shaming the polluters","story":"Global environment editor Jonathan Watts discusses the ’s investigation into the fossil fuel industry, and the structures that need to change to halt the climate emergency.

Their jubilation was understandable – Genk is a family club from a small industrial city in Limburg with a 31-year history, yet there they were standing at the summit once again.As the fans and players celebrated, the club had no choice but to move on and quickly concern itself with one simple question: what happens next?There are few leagues in Europe like the Belgian Pro League. Over the past five seasons, four clubs have won the title. The difference in income between the top teams is relatively small and even then, Genk were the fifth-richest club last season. Finishing fifth, the season before seemed to help the squad greatly as the players flew low under the radar. With sufficient breathing space to develop as a team, they soared.This year, they have no such fortune. For a team like Genk, who host Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday, success presents a showroom for the bigger clubs and the vultures are always there to lure their players away.Genk are no strangers to the ephemeral nature of football. The walls of its academy are lined with photos of the countless young players the club has produced or developed, including Kevin De Bruyne to Thibaut Courtois. As soon those players are close to fulfilling their talent, they are gone.For Koen Daerden, technical director at the Genk youth academy, the commitment to youth and to the technical, intelligent players is a key pillar of their philosophy: “What we are doing is all about vision from the youngest, under-7 till under-21,” he says. “It’s one line. We continuously have to change our manner to look forward ... but the philosophy stays the same. It’s to give young people time, to be patient.”Genk’s biggest departures at the end of the season were their captain, Leandro Trossard, now at Brighton, Ruslan Malinovskyi and the manager, Philippe Clement. It could have been worse. The club spent a nervous summer anticipating transfers for their other talismans the Tanzania striker Mbwana Samatta is an intelligent finisher who scored 32 goals last season and the 6ft 4in Norwegian Sander Berge, 21, bossed most midfields. In the end, they decided to remain for one more year.With the additions of Théo Bongonda and two 20-year-olds in Ianis Hagi, son of the great Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi, and the Colombian defender Carlos Cuesta, it could even be argued that they are even stronger.But Genk sit in sixth. The attempts of the manager, Felice Mazzù, to focus on defensive stability have been relatively successful. On Saturday, after an acrid 1-0 away defeat to Standard Liège, the usually cool Mazzu brandished a screenshot of a contentious decision to a journalist. The pressure is clearly mounting.“It’s part of our club,” says Darden. “We know that we have to build again after a championship, after a few good years. With a new coach, with other young, developing players like Hagi. They take some time.“Three years ago, we had first-class players who were sitting on the bench in the beginning and in the end they made us champions.”Belgian football is not immediately known for the behaviour of its crowds, but perhaps it should be. During the celebrations in a Genk club, Trossard led the fans as they belted out a pitiful, childish homophobic cheer that has spread across the league in recent seasons, aimed at Club Brugge: “All farmers are gays”. During the inevitable apology, his excuse was that he was drunk.In the bitter Limburg derby against Sint-Truiden, Genk relinquished a 3-0 away half-time lead for 3-3. All the while, the Genk goalkeeper, Gaëtan Coucke, was pelted with bottles and lighters while the Genk fans broke the plexiglass screen erected to separate them and their flares from the pitch.The match was abandoned and now the possibility of fines, deducted points and closed-door games loom. Both teams blame the other.In their previous two Champions League appearances, Genk have played their home and away games like two different clubs. They have been battered 5-0, 6-0 and 7-0 away to Chelsea, Real Madrid and Valencia, but they held each team to solid draws at home. There has been little difference this year. A terrified Genk was ravaged 6-2 away by Red Bull Salzburg, but Mazzù’s defensive focus was justified by a spirited 0-0 home draw with Napoli. They are chasing their first win.“This is the KRC Genk that you will see more often in the future, said Hagi after Napoli. “The newcomers are gradually starting to find their way. I think it is normal that something like this can take a few months, but beautiful moments are coming.”Hagi will face Liverpool on his 21st birthday. It seems impossible, but there would be no greater stage to produce one of those beautiful moments and mark a first certain step towards wherever this club is heading to next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf269d7db98ef246927defe9369310dac3bc2457/0_73_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4767b344751dc4b208163acc68ea114d","title":"sol campbell appointed southend united manager","story":"Southend have announced the appointment of Sol Campbell as their new manager.The former England centre-back, who left his role as Macclesfield boss in the summer, has signed a deal until the end of the 2021-22 season at Roots Hall.Campbell takes over a team second from bottom of League One with just one win from 13 games.Campbell kept Macclesfield in League Two against the odds in his first managerial role, having taken over last November with the side seven points from safety, but he faces arguably an even tougher task at the Shrimpers.Southend are already eight points from safety, with only crisis-club Bolton keeping them off the foot of the table, and have taken just one point from their last four games.He will take over from caretaker Gary Waddock following Tuesday night’s home game with Doncaster.His first match in charge will be at home to leaders Ipswich on Saturday.The 45-year-old will be assisted by Hermann Hreidarsson, while former Manchester United striker Andy Cole has been named as his forward and attack coach.Hreidarsson and Cole, both former team-mates of Campbell at Portsmouth, also worked under him at Macclesfield, who survived on the final day of last season.His new club said in a statement that Campbell was “determined to push on and make his mark at Southend United with the help of his backroom staff”.Southend have turned to Campbell after scrapping plans to appoint former Celtic and Sweden striker Henrik Larsson.The club have been searching for a new permanent manager since the resignation of Kevin Bond in early September.Before his appointment at Macclesfield, Campbell had spoken out repeatedly about the barriers for aspiring Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) coaches."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d167b396e8b017339157556900d01e9552a29546/0_176_4751_2850/master/4751.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3c1d9a0305ca72f714a615f5defc43f","title":"womens football prize money world cup","story":"The announcement that viewing figures for the Women’s World Cup hit 1.12 billion is hugely impressive and raises vital questions about how we measure the success of the women’s game versus the men’s.If you put to one side the massive exception of the USA women’s national team generating more income than their male counterparts yet being paid less (which hints at this being more ideological than financial), then the argument against equal World Cup prize money and funding is that, generally, the men’s game generates more income that the women’s. Except this is never quantified. Because sponsorship rights and broadcast rights (which make up the majority of money generated) for both the men’s and women’s premier competitions are bundled and sold together, it is impossible.The assumption is that these big-money deals are sold overwhelmingly on the basis of the men’s World Cup. But this can only ever be an assumption when rights are bundled together. (Uefa, meanwhile, has unbundled the rights for its women’s competitions – the European Championship and Champions League.)So, in the absence of unbundled rights, why do we not use that figure to determine the women’s share? Why do we instead get another token “doubling” of the prize pot or investments when the numbers are so low?The announcement that the women’s prize pot will double again to $60m for the 2023 tournament makes for an impressive headline in isolation, evidence that Fifa does indeed care, until you read that the men’s is increasing by $10m more than that, to $440m, in time for the Qatar World Cup. When Megan Rapinoe was asked ahead of before the USA’s semi-final against England whether she felt, as a campaigner, they were making a material difference given the mid-tournament raft of Fifa announcements – among them a further doubling of the prize fund and a $500m investment in women’s football (since upped to $1bn) – she was dismissive.“Double it now and use that number to double it or quadruple it for the next time,” she said. “I think that is what I mean when we talk about whether we feel respected. If you really care about game in the same way, why are you letting the gap grow? We’re not asking for $450m for lots of different reasons – the men’s game is far more advanced financially than the women’s game.”While there was undoubtedly a huge amount of respect for Rapinoe, this also prompted the view that she was simply being radical for the sake of it, that laying into Fifa as big money was being poured in was misjudged or misplaced.Except in the above context, her comments are transformed. If anything, they are relatively conservative and very considered. “You don’t get to have an incredible business running it on a budget of a dollar more than last year,” she said. “You have to bet on the future of the women’s game and it has proved World Cup after World Cup, year after year that we are worthy of investment and the quality on field is there and we need the business step to be in line with the steps we are making in performing on the field.”• The Manchester City defender Aoife Mannion will “shortly undergo surgery” after rupturing her cruciate ligament in the Champions League draw with Atlético Madrid.

Rodri had clotheslined Masiello before the hosts poured forward.Sergio Agüero gets the goal but it’s all Raheem Sterling’s work. The winger cuts inside wonderfully, laying the ball on a plate for the striker. It’s great movement but a beautiful cross by Sterling. Just like that, City are back level. That’s Agüero’s ninth of the season.31 min: It looks as though Ilkay Gündogan has slipped in Raheem Ster ... but Atalanta nip in. Superb defending by Toloi, who read that pass like a book.30 min: Just as it seems City were beginning to click and Atalanta a little sloppy, the Serie A side put their noses in front. Behind Gollini’s goal, the Italian fans are going absolutely berserk. There are more than 2,500 in the house.Ruslan Malinovskiy sends Ederson the wrong way. Ice cool from 12 yards. It was a clumsy challenge by Fernandinho, an unorthodox centre-back for City, who extended his leg into Ilicic. A penny for the thoughts of John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi, who are sat in toasty tracksuits on the City bench.26 min: Penalty to Atalanta ... !25 min: Agüero passes up a golden chance! Foden tiptoes around two Atalanta defenders, sliding the ball back for Agüero, who somehow blasts over. That was absolutely magnificent from Foden, who waltzed beyond a pair of blue-and-black shirts as though they were not there. City have gone up a gear or two.24 min: Agüero forces an excellent save! Pierluigi Gollini gets the faintest of touches – fingertips at best – to a dipping, bending strike by the City striker. Agüero did everything right, buying himself a yard before letting fly with his right foot but his curling effort ends up dropping just wide of a post, via Gollini. 23 min: Almost! Sterling ends up playing the ball ever so slightly behind Sergio Agüero, who was waiting for a tap in inside the six-yard box. It stemmed from another good move down the left, with Mendy involved again. He then found Phil Foden, who played a delightful ball into Sterling, who got his wires crossed.22 min: Mendy piles down the left flank, he eats up 25-odd yards before floating a ball across goal. It’s a decent ball in but Gosens is there to clear Atalanta’s lines. Still, back City come. Now they’re beginning to turn it on ...20 min: Elsewhere, Spurs are two goals to the good:19 min: Ilicic cuts inside, nudging the ball beyond Fernandinho before taking aim. It is low and hard, driven at the near post but Ederson’s equal to it.16 min: Foden goes down in the box under pressure from Djimsiti – but the referee is having none of it. The defender undoubtedly tangles with Foden, who tries to power his way through after Raheem Sterling’s pass was a little wayward, but the teenager loses out in the strength stakes, and Atalanta stand firm. Djimsiti and Foden grapple, yanking at each other’s arms and the latter was adamant he should have had a penalty. You’ve seen em given.14 min: City have had a couple of sniffs of goal, but the way in which they are being carved open down their right-hand side must be worrying Pep Guardiola. Papu Gomez is the latest to almost find a way in down the Atalanta left.12 min: Castagne heads over! Atalanta pass up a golden chance, with Robin Gosens – again – burrowing into a massive hole left by Walker, on his 100th start for City. Gosens dinks a ball into the box but the lack of pace on the cross allows Mendy to nibble back at his man and make life difficult for Castagne.10 min: Masiello, once found guilty of match fixing while on the books at Bari, picks up a yellow card for a late challenge on De Bruyne – but City waste the resulting free-kick, 30 yards or so from goal. City are yet to truly get into their stride.9 min: From that long ball downfield, Atalanta spread the ball wide through Papu Gomez. Gosens does well again, charging into space vacated by Kyle Walker and there is an inquest in the City defence as to how there was so much room for the visitors to play. Gosens cut the ball back but it was played behing Ilicic. The early skirmishes suggest Atalanta are intent on not just making up the numbers here.8 min: De Bruyne is almost played in but the midfielder cannot keep hold of the ball. Atalanta tidy things up, but Djimsiti is caught in two minds and the former Aston Villa goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini hoofs the ball clear.6 min: Atalanta have leaked 19 goals in 10 games so far this season but City are yet to truly trouble the Serie A side, who have made a decent start. Ilicic is slipped in but he fails to trap the ball and City get away with some lax defending.4 min: Benjamin Mendy is booked for a poor challenge on Ilicic. The City defender ended up lunging for the ball with his left foot after failing to take. Mendy knows it was high.3 min: Papu Gomez makes some in-roads down the left but Kyle Walker, back in the starting XI after illness, gets in a decent block. Gosen was again involved in the buildup to that move. Encouraging stuff for Atalanta.1 min: Not the most confident of starts from Ederson, who makes a mess of scooping Gosen’s awkward, high ball from the left flank. Still, City soon clean things up and surge forward up the other end.Sergio Agüero and Phil Foden get things started.We’re almost there. A healthy number of Manchester City fans boo the Champions League anthem as the teams lineup on the pitch. That’s seemingly a nod to Uefa’s perceived inadequate action over racism. Uefa can dish out fines for such booing.Here we go! The teams trudge out on to the pitch.Erm, Joleon Lescott is doing something of a DJ set in Manchester City’s exclusive tunnel club. Meanwhile, more than 2,500 Atalanta fans are in attendance at the Etihad, desperate to see their team win their first ever Champions League point. The Italian side chartered nine planes out of Milan’s Malpensa airport, with hundreds more making their own way to Manchester.The reason for Oleksandr Zinchenko’s absence? A knee injury, according to Manchester City. The club says: “The Ukrainian will be assessed over the coming days to determine the extent of the problem.” The 22-year-old has made nine appearances so far this term, having played 29 times last season.Papu Gomez, the Atalanta skipper, is the king of dad dancing. Born in Buenos Aires, the 31-year-old forward, an old school No 10, has thrived in an Atalanta shirt since joining from Metalist Kharkiv two years ago. He has scored four caps for Argentina and four goals in his past four games and, on the below evidence, he is good to go.Team news news: so, Rodri and Fernandinho remain at centre-back for City, while the inclusion of Phil Foden is exciting as Pep Guardiola makes four changes from victory over Crystal Palace. This is Foden’s second start of the season and only his 16th in all competitions.

Marko Marin finds the head of Tomane, who fails to trouble Gazzaniga unduly. 30 min: Free-kick for Red Star, which might as well be a corner. The ball’s played into the penalty area, where Serge Aurier clears with a header. That’ll be a Red Star throw-in, deep in Tottenham territory. The Serbian side are starting to find their feet in this contest. 29 min: Marin plays a deft little pass into space in the Tottenham penalty area. He’s thoping Tomane will reach it first, but Vertonghen clears before the striker can get on the ball. 27 min: Tottenham goalkeeper Gazzaniga saves unconvincingly from a Rajiv van la Parra downward header at the far post. He es and catches the ball, but then drops it. Davinson Sanchez is on hand to clear before anyone in a navy shirt can pounce. 24 min: Son and Davies combine down the left to tee Lamela up with a pull-back into the Red Star penalty area. He stretches to fire off a shot, which Borjan saves well. This is exhibition stuff from Tottenham’s players, who look like they’re having something resembling fun for the first time this season. Elsewhere in Group B: Olympiacos have taken the lead against Bayern Munich. It’s 1-0 in Greece. 22 min: Tanguy Ndomeble tries to curl a shot around Borjan and inside the far post, but the goalkeeper is wise to his caper. He saves and Spurs win a corner when Dele Alli tries to contest the follow-up at the far post. Nothing comes from the set piece. 21 min: Marko Marin plays a cross into the Tottenham penalty area. Nemanjja Milunovic gets his head to it, but sends the ball narrowly wide. 18 min: Red Star win a free-kick halfway inside the Tottenham half. The ball’s played into the Tottenham penalty area, where Kane heads clear. Spurs gallop upfield on the break and find themselves with a six-on-three, which comes to nothing when Son misplaces a pass to Serge Aurier. If anything, Clive, they had too many men in that counter-attack. Son doubles Tottenham’s lead! The South Korean arrives unmarked in the Red Star penalty area at the end of a 20 metre run and roofs the ball from a diagonal angle after being teed up by a Erik Lamela. 14 min: Good play by Marko Gobeljc, the Red Star right-back galloping upfield to volley a ball from deep across the Tottenham Penalty area. He has no team-mates in the box to get on the end of his cushioned cross. 14 min: Red Star are making life easy for them, but Spurs look unrecognisable from the rabble that have played so listlessly in their previous three games. They’re on it, tonight. 13 min: Kane goes close again, shooting straight at Borjan from a tight angle after combining with Son. 11 min: Tottenham are well worth their lead, even at this early stage. Lamela had shaped to take that corner, only to be stopped by the referee, who had spotted some pushing and shoving in the area. After a brief delay, he gave Lamela the signal to take it and his whipped cross was met by Kane. Tottenham lead! Rajiv van la Parra is dispossessed after receiving a pass from Marko Marin deep in Tottenham territory and the home side advance once again. They win a corner, which Erik Lamela swings in from the right. Harry Kane gets in front of his man, leaps highest and glances a header in at the far post. 5 min: Good interplay between Son and Dele Alli leads to the South Korean making room for a shot on the edge of the Red Star penalty area. He shoots feebly and straight at goalkeeper Milan Borjan while aiming for the bottom left-hand far corner. 4 min: Jan Vertonghen beats Red Star striker Tomane in the air as the Portuguese leaps to try and bring down a high ball towards the edge of the penalty area. 2 min: Be Davies prods the ball through the centre to Son, who tries to play Harry Kane in behind the Red Star defence. The Tottenham skipper advances into the Red Star penalty area, where he jinks past Milos Degenek, but appears to dig his foot into the turf and fall while trying to unleash a shot. A good start from Tottenham. 1 min: Red Star get the ball rolling, their players wearing navy shirts, shorts and socks with red trim. Tottenham’s players wear white shirts, shorts and socks. A brief pause: A group photo is taken with selected players from each team each team brandishing an #equalgame anti-racism sign. A Uefa initiative, it’s far easier than actually doing anything useful and proactive to combat discrimination in the game. Not long now: The teams line up in the tunnel and are led out on to the pitch by captains Harry Kane and Marko Marin. Once there, they line up either side of the team of match officials, with all concerned looking suitably pensive as the Champions League anthem is played.Mauricio Pochettino makes four changes from the team that was slightly fortuitous to draw with Watford at the weekend. Ben Davies, Tanguy Ndombele, Erik Lamela and Son Heung-min come into the side, with Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose conspicuous by their absence from the match day squad. Giovani Lo Celso features on the bench, with with fit-again Christian Eriksen also among the substitutes.Red Star named former Chelsea midfielder Marko Marin and ex-Huddersfield winger Rajiv Van La Parra in their starting line-up. White Hart Lane will not be at full capacity tonight, as Red Star have been banned from selling tickets to their fans as part of a punishment for racist chanting at a July qualifier against HJK Helsinki in Finland. The upshot? Their hosts have the full allocation and are struggling to fill it.Spurs did not put tickets on general sale in case they were bought by Red Star supporters, while Tottenham members who joined in the last month are have also been forbidden from buying tickets, in a bid to avoid any potential chicanery on the part of opposition fans. After all, it’s not like anyone else would be falling over themselves to sign up as Tottenham members in the past month.The club’s 48,000 season ticket holders have been given the opportunity to buy up to three additional seats in the hope of boosting the attendances, but Tottenham’s recent form means the take-up on those has been low.Red Star have brought 200 “supporters”, all of whom have Category One tickets and will be enjoying hospitality. The punishment for racist chanting, it appears, doesn’t extend to those in the corporate seats, who are presumably precluded from chanting of any kind because their mouths are full of prawn sandwich and many of them have no interest whatsoever in football. Vladan Milojevic speaks: “Tottenham are going through a tough period but that happens with every club,” said Red Star’s manager upon being asked about Tottenham’s poor run of form. “There’s too much emphasis on it. Pochettino is one of the best coaches in Europe if not the world.“We are looking at Tottenham as Tottenham of the past, an excellent team. We are going to give our all and play a good match. If we play our game they will not be able to stop us: that’s my philosophy.”Mauricio Pochettino speaks: Although he’s extremely unlikely to be short of high profile offers should he find himself out of a job, Mauricio Pochettino has conceded that his position at Tottenham is under threat unless there is a significant improvement in results. As he addressed the press yesterday, he stressed that tonight’s game is a big one, but no more so than any other.“Every game is important to win, not only tomorrow,” he said. “In this type of period, the worst opponents are ourselves. We need to compete not only with Red Star but ourselves to try to build our confidence, be solid and perform the way we want.”Which must mean there is pressure on his team, right? “There is no pressure on the team – they have to feel the freedom to play,” he said. “Against Watford, we made a mistake in the first action and we were punished and conceded, also against Brighton. When this type of period arrives the most important thing is understanding we have to give our best, be strong, solid, focused and concentrate.”White Hart Lane is the venue for tonight’s Champions League group game between Tottenham Hotspur and Red Star Belgrade. Two matches into the campaign and Tottenham Hotspur are yet to get a win and sit bottom of Group B on goal difference following the humiliation they suffered at the hands of Bayern Munich last time out.Their Serbian opponents, Red Star, have three points in the bag, having beaten Olympiacos and come into tonight’s game on a run of six consecutive wins in all competitions. Tottenham, by contrast, have won just three out of 12 this season and are terribly out of form, but remain white-hot favourites to prevail against opposition who have never taken a point on their travels in the Champions League. Kick-off is at 8pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f2c5320d6092e3c3d79bbfe6191f20b29fa1d4d/982_98_2638_1582/master/2638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec45c5ed48173c9eea26d2299c449b39","title":"dennis quaid why i worry about men who marry women 40 years younger than them","story":"65-year-old Dennis Quaid is engaged to 26-year-old Laura Savoie – which will be his fourth marriage and continue an interesting patternDennis Quaid, a 65-year-old man who already looks like his own waxwork, yesterday announced his engagement to Laura Savoie. At 26, she already looks like every one of his three ex-wives – if none of them ever aged. And while I do think we should all be able to date anyone we like as long as it’s consensual, I do worry about him a little bit.In general, I worry about any man who chooses to date a woman 40 years younger – mainly because she will always outperform him in sports, but also because it’s awkward when people can’t tell if your companion is your daughter or your wife.Quaid’s first wife, the actor PJ Soles, of Carrie fame, was three years older than him when they married and no one batted an eyelid. When Quaid married his second wife, also a blond actor – Meg Ryan, heard of her? – everyone wished them well. Ryan is eight years younger than Quaid.If once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and the third time is a pattern, perhaps we should have seen the next one coming – a bit like a Russian doll.At the tender age of 50, Quaid married his third wife, Kimberley Buffington, then 34, and the couple had twins. Could anyone have guessed what happened next?Well, probably. Quaid is well-known for his starring role as the father of twins in the Parent Trap. As actor Elaine Hendrix, who played his 26-year-old fiancee in the Parent Trap pointed out, the real life script had already been written: in the movie, Quaid’s character, the father of twins, splits from his wife and gets engaged to a 26-year-old blond woman.Now, I hear some of you already: so what if Quaid is now marrying a 26-year-old? Maybe she is wise beyond her years, or maybe Quaid is just immature. That’s not to mention that his new young fiancee has the free will to marry whomever she likes – it would be unfeminist not to point this out, right?I agree that as long as they’re happy, we should be happy for them. But if Quaid keeps on consecutively marrying younger and younger, then disregarding the math in this case would be reckless.“His first wife was three years older than he was. His second wife (Meg Ryan) was ten years younger. His third wife was twenty years younger. His fourth wife will be forty years younger.”The logical end to this pattern? “Dennis Quaid’s fifth wife hasn’t been born yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b896ff763e0fb6aa8ea9974c7e02c515547aab/0_0_8889_5333/master/8889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b86687182f925c7d0bc45d17a35caa01","title":"match of the day meet the people who helped their ex find new love","story":"You may find the idea of setting up your ex-partner with a date ridiculous – but, for some, it couldn’t be more naturalAfter Elliot broke up with his girlfriend Kelly, they stayed friends. Why wouldn’t they? The breakup had been amicable after dating for a year and moving in together, they started squabbling over silly things and figured they were better off apart. They were on a night out in April last year with their friendship group when Elliot, a 27-year-old childcare worker from Lancashire, bumped into Tom, an old work colleague. They made small talk for a bit, before going their separate ways. But Tom had caught Kelly’s eye, and the next day she called Elliot with an unusual request: could he set them up on a date?Elliot wasn’t opposed to the idea, but there was a problem. “I said: ‘I have no idea who you’re on about!’” he remembers. “We’d had such a brief conversation that it didn’t stick in my memory.” A few days later at work, Elliot’s team leader mentioned Tom’s name. “I thought: ‘That’s who she meant!’ I texted her saying: ‘It’s this guy.’” Kelly and Tom started messaging Elliot even helped her craft the initial, flirtatious texts. It worked: Kelly and Tom now live together.There are countless articles online about how to find love after a breakup – or win your ex back, if that’s what you want. Helping an ex-partner find love with someone new is an entirely different and much rarer phenomenon. But it happens. This month, New Zealand couple Damien and Whakarongotai Nikora’s Facebook statuses went viral. They had posted announcing their split, and both had included a personal ad on behalf of the other. The pair, who were married for 21 years, titled their posts: “Why you should date my ex.” “If you get the chance to date her, lucky man,” wrote Damien of Whakarongotai.Most people – at least those whose relationships were not abusive or vitriolic – want their exes to be happy. But actively working to help your ex find love? It is unusual, particularly in monogamous circles. Some of Elliot’s co-workers struggled to understand his actions. “They said: ‘I’d hate to see my ex getting with someone else.’ But I thought, why? You’re not together any more. Why should that concern you?”An advantage of setting up your ex is that you know their quirks and foibles better than almost anyone else, and can vet prospective partners for compatibility. “You know your exes, and you know your friends, so you can basically tell what sort of people they will like in relationships and what they do like and don’t like,” says Andrea Campos, 25, a lawyer from London. Two years ago, she was on holiday with a female friend in Dubai when Campos’s ex-boyfriend messaged her. He had seen her friend in the photos Campos had been sharing, and found her attractive.“I said: ‘Do you want me to play Cupid?” Campos says. He agreed. They dated for a short while, but nothing long-term came of it. She doesn’t view her actions as remarkable. “I’m not a jealous person. If I think people will get on, I’ll introduce them. You want the people you care about to be happy, and if you think they’d be happy together, you might as well help.”Although it might seem tempting to launch into your address book and begin setting up your former flames and friends, a word of caution: it is not a risk-free exercise. Perhaps you will discover that you are not over them or, if the resulting relationship turns sour, you may get caught up in the fallout. But if you are thinking of setting up your ex with someone new, the first thing to do is check they are happy with it before you do. “It’s healthy to hope an ex-partner goes on to form other healthy relationships,” says Ammanda Major, a therapist with the relationship charity Relate. “But it depends on whether your ex wants you to do that. Otherwise, you’re treating them like a commodity, and selling them on.”Ask yourself why you’re trying to set up your ex. Are you genuinely motivated by feelings of altruism, or are you doing it to assuage guilt, or to prove a point? “If you ended the relationship and don’t want them to feel bad about it, you might think that fixing them up with someone new will take their mind off it,” Major says. “But it can be disrespectful to what you had, if it can quickly be overcome by being set up with someone new.” Above all, respect a firm no. “We all think we know best and so-and-so might be perfect for them. But doing things without someone’s permission is never a good idea.”Setting up your ex with someone new is an acid test for whether you are truly over that person. If the thought fills you with horror, you may still have feelings for them. “You have to be honest with yourself,” says Christina Gale, 27, who lives in London and works in social media. “If you’re funny about an ex, you’ve obviously still got feelings. If you’ve moved on, why wouldn’t you want to see them in a new relationship? I’m not a jealous person. I think everyone should be able to find love.”Setting up her friends with her exes has become Gale’s signature move. “I’ve done this so many times!” she laughs. “I date people and think, actually, you’d be better suited to someone else I know.” One ex sticks out: they had been together for six years, but ended things amicably. He had started hanging out with another woman – as friends – but Gale was convinced it could be something more. “I went to her and said: ‘Do you think he’s good-looking? She said: ‘Yeah!’” Gale let him know – and they started dating.Not everyone can understand a decision to set up an ex. “I have straight friends that say I’m crazy,” says Leo Camanho, 23, a student from Rio de Janeiro. “They say: ‘You’re so mature how can you do this?’” He set up his ex-boyfriend Lucas with his best friend, Fabio, after he and Lucas broke up. He thinks setting up your exes is more common in queer circles. “In Rio, if you’re not friends with your ex, you don’t have any exes, because everyone dates everyone here.” After Fabio and Lucas started dating, they came to Camanho for his blessing. “I said: ‘Totally, you are both friends of mine, I love you both, go and be happy.’”In New York’s queer scene, 28-year-old Remy Duran is a legend. The reality-TV star became known across the city for his little black book – in reality, a mobile phone full of contacts, with subfolders categorising sexual preference – that he uses to connect ex-partners looking for love (or sex). Duran didn’t set out to be New York’s answer to Cilla Black: his matchmaking was an incidental byproduct of his dating life. As he dated his way around New York, his social circle grew, and former partners would hit him up for advice if there was someone they had their eye on.“People would be like: ‘Do you know that person? I’ve wanted to hook up with them for ever. And I’d be like: ‘Sure, I don’t own them, you can totally see them!’” His matchmaking is primarily altruistic – he wants to ensure people are having a good time. But there is also a deeper motivation. “It feels liberating,” Duran says. “You don’t own anyone, and it gives you a sense of closure.” He has set up at least 20 former partners, ranging from hookups to ex-boyfriends. So far, so good. “They say thank you,” says Duran. “I don’t think I’ve had any complaints.”Polyamorous people may be more relaxed than monogamous people about helping their exes date someone new. One polyamorous person, who prefers to remain anonymous, says: “I don’t see it as ‘setting people up’. I mean, they’re poly, they bang whoever I just introduced them.” But outside of polyamory, setting up your ex with someone new is the ultimate affront to a monogamous dating culture that views ex-partners as possessions, rather than autonomous beings with free will. “We live in a possession-based culture where we see human beings as objects,” Elliot says. “You – you’re mine. Monogamous relationships can be like that. Even after you break up, people can’t let go of that sense of ownership. But I don’t think relationships should be possessive in that way.”Sometimes, setting up your ex with a friend happens so organically, it feels like an act of God. When Joanna Delooze was 20, she dated a man named Aaron. On one of their dates, Aaron mentioned that he had a list of qualities he looked for in a potential spouse. Delooze, who is now 55, made Aaron show her his list. “I read it and said: ‘I’m not joking, but with the exception of one thing, my roommate Linda ticks every single box on your list.’” She laughs. “It was completely her! If I was a guy, and this was my list, I’d date my roommate.”Delooze was absolutely right: Linda and Aaron have been together for 35 years and have six children. She is delighted to have helped engineer their happiness. “I see pictures of their family and all their kids and how they’re still together and I think it’s just great.”Some names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12031bb0ac340bb6b15ad0e26d500370dcd128dc/0_301_4500_2701/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b652da5e87f12ff265af6c0750b503","title":"how did a town in west virginia become the opioid capital of the us","story":"Chris McGreal reports on the web of doctors, pharmacists and drug companies that made rural Mingo county, West Virginia, the opioid capital of America.

If parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this. And with great regret, I must say the bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election,” he said.A No 10 source highlighted the key caveat that the bill would be pulled only if the EU grants a three-month extension – the length of delay requested under the Benn act. It raises the possibility that Johnson could accept a shorter extension if one were to be offered by the EU but this is unlikely given the legal letter that he sent asks for a three-month delay.The EU Withdrawal (No 2) Act, often referred to as the Benn act, is a law that was passed by MPs in an attempt to prevent Boris Johnson\u0027s government leaving the EU without a deal.It specifies that by 19 October the government must have either secured a deal that parliament has approved, or secured explicit approval from parliament to leave without a deal.If neither of those conditions are met – and if Johnson cannot get his deal passed on \u0027super Saturday\u0027 – it requires the prime minister to write to the EU to ask for a further Brexit extension. The form of the letter that the prime minister must send is set out in full in the act.The act says the extension should last until 31 January 2020, or longer if the EU suggests.Here is the full text of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No 2) Act 2019The Downing Street source said: “If parliament votes again for delay by voting down the programme motion, and the EU offers delay until 31 January – then we will pull the bill, there will be no further business for parliament and we’ll move to an election before Christmas.”No 10 would not elaborate on the length of extension that Johnson could accept, but a source suggested to the FT that 10 days could be acceptable and ITV reported that “the PM will be calling EU leaders tonight making clear our policy remains that we leave on 3110 and that no delays should be offered”.Johnson’s threat to pull the bill and try to frustrate a three-month extension appears intended to scare MPs who want a Brexit deal passed before an election or fear a crash-out. Nick Boles, the former Tory minister, urged people not to fall for Downing Street’s tactics, saying: “The PM won’t pull bill after winning second reading. He won’t call EU leaders urging them to refuse extension because that would be against the law.’”Johnson made the threat as Downing Street tried to face down soft-Brexit Conservative MPs who are refusing to agree to the accelerated timetable without further concessions to stop a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020The former chancellor Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart, another former cabinet minister, are leading the rebellion against the programme motion if there is no mechanism to prevent the UK from crashing out on World Trade Organization terms at the end of 2020.Hammond told the Times the bill was “a camouflage to a no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020”. Stewart, another of the 21 Tories who had the party whip withdrawn last month, said he and some of his fellow rebels had been negotiating through the night to give parliament more control over the next phase of the Brexit negotiations, including being able to vote for an extension to the talks.Dominic Grieve, the former Tory attorney general, accused the prime minister of “bullying” tactics against MPs and said he would vote against the bill and its timetable.However, the group of 21 former Tory MPs is split, meaning the vote is hanging in the balance and the government could possibly narrowly still win with the backing of some Labour MPs.Margot James, another of the whipless Tories, said she was planning to support the government on all votes. Ed Vaizey, another former Conservative, also indicated he was planning to vote for Johnson’s timetable, although he said he may change his mind if Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, continued to send “ludicrous tweets” saying “a vote against the programme motion is a vote against Brexit”.Others were agonising over the decision, amid fears there could be consequences of Johnson’s Brexit deal that will take longer than three days to spot.MPs have been given three days to consider the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB), the legislation that formally puts the Brexit deal into law under treaty, prompting concern the process is being rushed.The Commons was due to vote on Tuesday evening on the “programme motion”, which sets out this timetable, shortly after voting on the second reading for the bill.Many MPs have voiced fears that a clause of the WAB allowing an extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020 can be triggered only by ministers, not parliament, and that if no trade deal was completed before then, it could be a “trapdoor” to no deal.However, Johnson’s spokesman insisted the 2020 deadline was sufficient, and that the PM had no intention of allowing a longer extension period.“It’s set out very clearly in the political declaration that the UK and the EU sides both agree that the implementation period concludes at the end of 2020,” he said. “The prime minister has been clear on any number of occasions that he is not intending to extend the implementation period.”To deal with the issue of a 2020 crash-out, Boles said he had tabled an amendment that would go even further, making a two-year extension to the transition period automatic if there were no trade deal in place by the end of next year.He said it would “would require the government to seek an extension to the transition to December 2022 unless MPs vote to the contrary … essential to stop hardline ERG members forcing through a no-deal Brexit in December 2020.”Clause 30, among a series of contentious clauses identified in the 115-page WAB, which MPs first saw on Monday evening, dictates that only ministers can seek a longer transition period, even though this must then be approved by parliament.Hilary Benn, the Labour MP who chairs the Brexit select committee, tweeted: “What happens if the government doesn’t propose an extension? Parliament would have no say and we would exit the transition period on the 31 December 2020 even if a trade agreement hadn’t been reached by then with the EU ie no deal.”The Green MP Caroline Lucas called the clause “the trapdoor to no deal”, adding: “If the government doesn’t propose an extension to the transition, MPs have no say, and therefore if negotiations on future relationship unfinished by end of December next year, we’re out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/800763c8b90674c49ac252ee345d438641ea2b9a/0_33_1650_990/master/1650.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef63c84185cf883a7a952cccc525ffae","title":"starmer clashes shadow cabinet over second referendum labour brexit","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary faces backlash from Labour colleagues over party’s stanceThe shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has clashed with shadow cabinet colleagues over Labour’s stance on a second referendum, the  understands.At the weekly shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Starmer suggested Labour policy meant the party must support any amendment to the government’s withdrawal agreement bill calling for a referendum on Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal – and then campaign for remain.But in a debate that became testy at times, according to two people present, Starmer faced a backlash from colleagues including Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett.One witness said Lavery accused Starmer of “ramming this policy down my throat for 18 months”.There was a separate discussion about when Labour should be willing to back a general election, if Johnson’s deal is defeated – with Corbyn loyalists Laura Pidcock and Dan Carden calling for the party to support an early poll.Downing Street has suggested that if MPs reject Johnson’s bill – or amend it to force him to negotiate a customs union – he could pull it, and ask MPs to support a general election instead.Labour twice voted against Johnson’s efforts to secure a mid-October general election, which requires a two-thirds majority under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.Corbyn has repeatedly said that once a Brexit extension is secured, he will support a snap poll – but some Labour MPs would like to see a referendum held first.The prime minister sent a letter on Saturday to the European council president, Donald Tusk, requesting an extension, after MPs withheld their approval from his deal until the withdrawal agreement bill has been passed.In the shadow cabinet discussions about whether Labour would campaign for remain against Johnson’s deal, Lavery and Trickett pointed to the motion passed at last month’s Labour conference in Brighton, which said: “The party shall only decide how to campaign in such a referendum through a one-day special conference, following the election of a Labour government.”Party members backed the motion after Corbyn made clear he wanted the decision about its referendum stance to be taken after a Labour government came to power.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, also expressed concerns about supporting a compromise similar to the Kyle-Wilson amendment.The Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson previously suggested they could support Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement if it was subjected to a confirmatory referendum. But Corbyn said he would “caution” MPs against being willing to accept that quid pro quo.The new Brexit deal is essentially the old\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal with a new chapter on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland and a few key tweaks to the political declaration. Here is a\u0026nbsplink to the full text.The backstop has essentially been replaced by a full stop whereby Northern Ireland remains aligned to the EU from the end of the transition period for at least four years. A change can only happen if it is voted on by the Stormont assembly.Stormont will have a key role in future Brexit arrangements. And if there is cross-community support to remain aligned to the EU rather than the UK the consent will hold for eight years.The arrangements in this deal will automatically kick in for a mandated four years if there is a breakdown in trade talks, so it remains a “backstop” but with a permanent tinge.That four-year period will start at the end of December 2020.Two months before the end of the four-year period, that is October 2024, Stormont will be asked to vote on whether to remain aligned to the EU in ways outlined by this deal or not.Under the deal, the UK and the EU are “underlining their firm commitment to no customs and regulatory checks or controls and related physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland”.The EU and the UK will aim for a zero-tariff deal with unlimited quotas. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will be free to sign trade deals. The line in the political declaration that “the United Kingdom will consider aligning with union rules in relevant areas” in any future trade talks has been ditched.Northern Ireland will remain legally in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs unions. There will therefore be no customs checks on the border but tariffs will be payable on certain commercial goods.No customs duties will be payable on “personal property” being transited from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That protects online shopping and all items bought for personal rather than commercial use.Customs duties will be payable on goods imported from the UK for commercial use unless it can be demonstrated that the goods remain in Northern Ireland or are for personal use, as above.A system of rebates will allow importers to be reimbursed.The commitment to frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain is restated.EU law on VAT will apply in Northern Ireland.The island of Ireland is considering a single market for electricity so homes in Northern Ireland can get their energy from a supplier in Northern Ireland or the republic. There were fears this could be disrupted by Brexit. Under the Johnson deal, the provisions of union law remain so nothing will change.This guarantees that the UK will remain in line with EU conventions on climate, environment and workers rights in a future trade agreement.Abbott said last month: “I don’t think we should be supporting a bad deal, just because it’s got a referendum attached. That’s why I was against Kyle-Wilson.“Either it’s a good deal, which says something about the customs union, and alignment with the single market – or it’s not. The referendum is not an end in itself. Kyle-Wilson has resurfaced, and it was a bad idea the first time around, and I don’t support it.”Starmer, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have said publicly they would like to campaign for remain.But Trickett said earlier this month that he did not support the idea of a referendum that would pitch Johnson’s deal against remain.“A referendum before the election would imply a Tory Brexit against remain. I believe that the majority in the country voted for leave – and I feel that a Labour Brexit can only be delivered by a Labour government.Corbyn opened the meeting on Tuesday by reminding shadow cabinet members not to stray from Labour’s agreed policies in media appearances, according to those present."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cba6010ad99dc9eebd4c0a3dc421a70a690aa64/0_242_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93185f5f062e9465e07c8599cb53e930","title":"radical light and sound wave therapy could slow alzheimers","story":"Tests at MIT have shown a boost to the activity of the brain’s immune cellsDoctors in the US have launched a clinical trial to see whether exposure to flickering lights and low frequency sounds can slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.A dozen patients enrolled in the trial will have daily one-hour sessions of the radical therapy which researchers hope will induce brain activity that protects against the disorder.Animal tests have shown that exposure to light and sound waves at 40Hz reinforces so-called gamma waves in the brain, with knock-on effects across the organ. In mice used to model the disease, the therapy appears to boost the activity of the brain’s immune cells, making them clear the aberrant proteins that build up in Alzheimer’s.Li-Huei Tsai, a neuroscientist who is leading the trial at MIT, told the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago on Tuesday that the therapy improved the survival and health of the animals’ neurons, boosted their connectivity, and dilated blood vessels, all of which may benefit patients. “We would like to see if our approach slows Alzheimer’s disease,” Tsai told the .The patients enrolled on the trial will have cognitive tests every three months to assess their brain function and regular scans to measure their brain activity and the connectivity of neurons across the organ.Tsai told the conference that the light and sound sessions had boosted the amplitude and synchrony of 40Hz brain waves in the trial patients, but that it would take a year to gather data on whether the sessions helped to keep the disease at bay. The researchers call the exposure “gamma entrainment using sensory stimuli”, or Genus.A further 40 patients are to be recruited for a second trial that will examine directly whether the light and sound waves reduce levels of amyloid protein plaques and tau protein tangles – the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease – in the patients’ brains and cerebrospinal fluid.The unusual approach to combating Alzheimer’s draws on the ability of light and sound waves to affect electrical activity in the brain. In a series of papers published since 2016, Tsai and her colleagues have shown that light and sound waves oscillating at 40Hz strengthen waves of the same “gamma” frequency in the brain.In mice, at least, this appears to have multiple effects on cells in the brain, including ramping up the activity of the organ’s immune cells, making them more effective at clearing protein plaques and tangles.“We hope our findings in mice will translate to helping people with Alzheimer’s disease, though it’s certainly too soon to tell and many things that have worked in mice have not worked in people,” Tsai said.James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “Brain rhythms and their role in conditions like dementia are still mysterious, but this work begins to outline their impact on different types of brain cells and the mechanisms involved.“It’s very early days, but we look forward to seeing how this area of research develops.”In a separate development, a US company that declared its experimental Alzheimer’s therapy a failure in March has revived the drug after a fresh analysis found that it helped some patients. Biogen said it will ask the US drug regulators to approve aducanumab after it identified a statistically significant slowing in the decline of cognitive ability and basic activities of daily living in a subset of patients on high doses of the drug.Pickett said: “This is hugely exciting news. After the trial being stopped earlier this year because it appeared not to work, further analysis suggests that it does benefit people with dementia in the earliest stages.”“We’re waiting for further data but this could be the first new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease in over 15 years, and as such, has the potential to be a transformative discovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7394dcd2cdb1a5f620599e44cb164c58f37a214b/0_169_8400_5042/master/8400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=151c81cb34a90c7c8d1a426879af8265","title":"wales south africa rugby world cup","story":"Wales back themselves physically against anyone and if they justify that confidence against South Africa on Sunday they will very probably reach the final for the first time. The Springboks have beaten them in the past two World Cup tournaments in tight, hard‑fought contests, but a motivating end of an era beckons with Warren Gatland nearing his final week in charge of the Six Nations champions.Gatland’s side were knocked out of the 2015 World Cup by South Africa, succumbing to a late Fourie de Preez try after leading for much of the game, but they have won the four fixtures against the Springboks since and Gatland will have his charges primed as he focuses on the one trophy in club and Test rugby that has eluded him.“South Africa have huge forwards who like to get over the advantage line, or ad line as we call it,” said the Wales defence coach, Shaun Edwards, who like Gatland is moving on at the end of the tournament after nearly 12 years. “It is going to be a battle royale. If you miss tackles, and no one wants to, it is not one of the key indicators to winning a game.“The biggest one is the gainline: it is there where you win or lose the game in defence and we know we are going to have to muscle up. It will be a hugely physical game. They are fantastic defensively, statistically the best team in the world at the moment. I have a great deal of respect for their coach, Rassie Erasmus, and any team with him in charge will be well organised and be strong in the areas of kicking and defence where they have got blowtorch speed on the edges.”Wales have been susceptible out wide against Fiji and France in recent matches and Edwards acknowledged they would need to closely watch the South Africa wing Cheslin Kolbe, a three-quarter likened by Edwards to Jason Robinson having played with the England 2003 World Cup winner at Wigan. “If you want to watch a game of rugby, you want to see Cheslin Kolbe,” Edwards said.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter“He is one of the most dynamic players I have seen and we will have to keep an eye on him. I was lucky enough to play alongside Jason for several years and Kolbe is similar to him: incredibly explosive, short and he defied the perception that you need to be big to play rugby. South Africa have such speed outside that if there were a 4x100m relay of all the teams in the World Cup, they would probably win it.“Kolbe is showing that smaller guys can be brilliant on the Test stage. Look at the England and New Zealand backlines: some of their players are not massive, but they are skilful. It is still a game for all shapes and sizes and let’s hope that continues.”The first eight years of Gatland’s stint as head coach tended to be a hard luck story against the three major southern hemisphere nations.They are still looking for their first victory over New Zealand in 66 years, but since the last World Cup they are unbeaten against South Africa and have defeated Australia twice, including last month in a victory at the Tokyo Stadium that ensured they topped their pool.“We have got a decent record against South Africa now, but many of the games have been close,” said Edwards. Erasmus made the point after Sunday’s quarter-final victory over Japan that the two matches they had played against Wales since he took over at the beginning of last year had been with weakened teams, although 19 players who are here were involved in the 20-11 defeat in Cardiff last November.“The games against them tend to come down to one score and that is what is exciting this weekend: you are going into a game and you do not know who is going to win.“A World Cup semi-final is where you want to be and while our last three matches have not gone smoothly, they were character building. We have not lost a competitive game since February 2018. Are we a better team than 2011 when we reached the semi-final?

Everyone was smiling, and posing for photos. Then an old man asked if he could join me and we sat there together in silence. Until finally he started to laugh, a happy, high-pitched giggle that swirled like birdsong. He stopped to snort fresh breath, slapped one hand on his slacks, used the other to dry his eye, then started up all over again.“But,” he said, “but,” barely able to get the words out his mouth, “but Japan lost!”He didn’t mean it scornfully. There wasn’t a hint of admonishment in it. He was just delighted by everyone else’s newfound enthusiasm for a sport they had never really cared for before. They were almost as merry about it as he was. No one was crying, scowling, or scolding the players or calling for the coaches to be sacked, there weren’t any furious inquisitions in the papers or on the radio or TV shows.

But then he’s been working in sports politics for the past decade or so, on the Olympics beat, Beijing, London, Rio, and now Tokyo. We met at a match back in the first week of the World Cup. I liked him very much, which is why I’ve changed his name. He’d never covered rugby before, and he couldn’t have been any less impressed. The game, he complained, seemed slow and stodgy, the rules incomprehensible, and most of the players came across as so damn posh.A month later I saw him again, in Yokohama this time. I’d come scurrying down to the press room right after Japan had beaten Scotland. “That,” he said, breathlessly, “was brilliant.”He was grinning like a little kid. Grinning, in fact, like my six‑year‑old nephew in the photo taken on his first day back at school in Sapporo after the opening week of the tournament. He had never picked up a ball before, but he and his friends were so excited about the Rugby World Cup that they played a game in the break on Monday morning. He knocked out his two baby teeth making a tackle. He was pretty proud of his gap-toothed smile, they were wobbly anyway, he explained, and it saved him the trouble of teasing them out.There are serious discussions to be had about Japanese rugby. About whether the Japanese union has resources it needs to push through the necessary reform of their amateur league, and get the schools, universities, and corporations who run the game all working to the same end. About where they fit into the world game. The latest reports out of New Zealand are that, thank goodness, the southern unions have decided to keep Japan’s only fully professional team, the Sunwolves, in Super Rugby, and they are looking to fast-track the national team into the Rugby Championship too.And we could strain to explain the significance of it all, get at how sport has helped to bring everyone together, given people an outlet for all those pent-up emotions, maybe even reshaped their idea of what it means to be Japanese. And we could ask whether this World Cup is going to have any kind of legacy, as all big tournaments are now supposed to do, look at the regeneration of the stadiums or the development of new infrastructure, ask whether it has led a new great wave of enthusiasm for sport and exercise and all those other things they promise in the brochures.But really, it’s enough to say that this Japanese team spread a little happiness around, at a time when the country is still in mourning for the 80 people who died in Typhoon Hagibis. And what else is it all for, anyway, but entertainment? Japan were good at that, maybe the best of all the teams in this World Cup.It was there in Kotaro Matsushima’s dash and swagger, his perfectly swept hair, each strand in place even after he had thrown himself up from one of those headlong es for the tryline, and in Kenki Fukuoka’s ridiculous speed and skill, and the way he plucked that grubber from the air like he was pulling down one last apple as he was sprinting away from the farmer who had caught him scrumping, in Shota Horie’s wildman style, dreadlocks flying behind him as he threw himself into another collision, and Timothy Lafaele’s bottomless top-hat of magic tricks, flicks, kicks and passes.

Writing in the , Allan promised a “dedicated operations centre” in the UK if an election is declared, to quickly remove content that breaks Facebook’s rules, such as misleading information about the mechanics of the election, or content aimed at encouraging users not to vote at all.Allan also promised a dedicated channel to report harassment for MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates, and a wider selection of adverts contained in the site’s ad library, which will now store adverts about issues including immigration, health and the environment, as well as elections and referenda, as it previously did.Collins’s letter comes on the heels of a major series of announcements by Facebook designed to plan for a US election in 2020, including stricter rules on disclosing who controls a popular page, and new bans on political adverts that attack democracy in general."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e52f4cb0d71a3670e733a0897ccaaaa07d868402/100_97_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8383b1deb27abd303466575c8443fe02","title":"tell us about your favourite undiscovered places in the uk","story":"We would like to hear your stories and see your photos of your best places in England that may not be well knownLonely Planet has named England the world’s second tourist destination in 2020.

From travel apps and carbon calculators to free public transport, here’s how you can make a differenceIndustry experts believe that a nationwide transport revolution is required to mitigate the climate crisis, and that smart technology could transform the way we travel. Travel apps are making sustainable transport options more accessible to the growing number of people keen to change their travel plans to reduce their environmental impact.Tools include the calculator at EcoPassenger, which directly compares energy consumption and carbon emissions of planes, cars and trains for any journey. Meanwhile, Lime’s new electric bike and scooter sharing scheme is taking off in London and Milton Keynes, and Europe’s leading train and coach app, Trainline, is making greener travel more hassle-free for customers globally by investing in technology to help make train and coach travel across 45 countries more accessible. “Our long-term vision is to enable everyone to travel from A to B much faster and more efficiently, in a way that’s better for the environment,” says Clare Gilmartin, CEO of Trainline. “We use artificial intelligence and advanced mobile technology so that, via our app, customers can travel by train and coach seamlessly, with on-the-go access to real-time journey information, using digital tickets to skip queues and with access to clever features like BusyBot, which harnesses crowdsourced data to help people find a seat on a busy train. We believe smart tech has a crucial role to play in encouraging and enabling people to travel sustainably.”The government has invested £1.5bn in grants between 2015 and 2020 for electric plug-in vehicles and schemes to kickstart the rollout of charge-point infrastructure, while pledging that all new cars and vans should be zero-emission by 2040, according to its Road to Zero strategy. Childs insists this is not enough: “The only way we can make the scale of reductions we need fast enough is by having a revolution in transportation.”Lisbon has one of the world’s largest electric vehicle charging point networks, while Estonia and Luxembourg have introduced countrywide free public transport. “Free public transport is transformational, not only for the environment – it’s also socially progressive,” adds Childs. Trainline found that a quarter of young Brits would reduce time behind the wheel to be more sustainable, and Friends of the Earth is calling for the government to make bus travel free to under-30s to reduce the need for young people to buy cars and help people switch to public transport.By driving positive change through technology, travel apps help create a more sustainable and efficient transport infrastructure, enabling a smoother transition to lower carbon-impact travel, within the UK and beyond.Book travel in and across 45 countries today with Trainline, Europe’s leading train and coach app"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c0f14c375f014dbb2e32b4cec28918b11daf77/227_320_4836_2902/master/4836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeeecb8be7305c2efcd9f68dd033bfb7","title":"rail adventures five scenic european journeys to savour","story":"With train travel often more sustainable than driving or flying, now’s the time to leave the car at home.

If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

His films long shied away from discussing humanity’s impact on the planet. Now they are sounding the alarm – but is it too late? By  Patrick BarkhamIn the late 1980s, a meeting was convened at the BBC studios on Whiteladies Road in Bristol. Its participants – mainly amiable former public schoolboys named Mike – discussed the imminent retirement of a grey-haired freelancer, who had been working with the BBC for almost four decades. “We need to think about who is going to take over from David when this series is finished,” a junior producer, Mike Gunton, remembered his boss saying. David Attenborough was nearing 65 and putting the finishing touches to The Trials of Life, the third of his epic series about the natural world. These programmes had been broadcast around the globe. They had established a new genre, perhaps even a new language, of wildlife films. It was a fine legacy. Now it was time to go.When Alastair Fothergill became head of the BBC Natural History Unit a few years later, executives were still worrying over the same question. The BBC director-general asked him to find a new David Attenborough. “I remember thinking, that’s not very sensible,” said Fothergill. “He has always been this great oak tree under which it’s been hard for a sapling to grow.” Today, Mike Gunton has ascended the ranks to become creative director of the Natural History Unit. He still attends meetings on Whiteladies Road. But, three decades after the subject was first broached, finding the next David Attenborough is no longer on the agenda. “We still haven’t got an answer and I don’t want one,” Gunton told me.Attenborough was born on 8 May 1926, 17 days after the Queen. And, like the Queen, he has become a symbol of stability in a turbulent world. It is hard to imagine a time before he was on our screens, affably engaging with sloths or giant turtles – partly because there wasn’t. Television was invented the year after he was born, and only began to enter people’s homes in the 1950s, when he was beginning his career. The first programme he made was watched by barely 10,000 people gazing at 405 flickering black-and-white lines on large boxes in living rooms in the south-east of England. This spring, his series Our Planet became Netflix’s most-watched original documentary, watched by 33 million people in its first month. This autumn, the BBC will broadcast Seven Worlds, One Planet, the 19th blockbuster series he has written and presented (add a zero and then some if also counting his pre-70s series, short series and one-offs). The television executives who keep offering this 93-year-old freelancer bountiful employment agree that he is more powerful than ever.Attenborough and the Queen are more than just contemporaries. “I see them quite a lot,” Attenborough said of the royal family when I met him at his home in Richmond earlier this year. He first encountered the Queen’s children, Charles and Anne, in 1958, when they toured the BBC’s Lime Grove studios and the young presenter introduced them to his pet cockatoo, Cocky. In 1986, the year after Attenborough was knighted, he produced the first of six Christmas broadcasts for the Queen. Earlier this year, he was interviewed by Prince William on stage at Davos the future king asked him for advice on how best to save the planet.In our fractured age, Attenborough is the closest we have to a universally beloved public figure. Last year, a YouGov poll found him to be the most popular person in Britain. The crowd at Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage roared when he appeared on stage this summer. Viewers of Love Island expressed outrage when one contestant declared she found his programmes boring. But Attenborough transcended national treasure status some years ago. He is a truly global figure now. So many Chinese viewers downloaded Blue Planet II “that it temporarily slowed down the country’s internet”, according to the Sunday Times. The premiere of his new series, which took place earlier this month in London, was broadcast live in South Africa and India, where rapt schoolchildren held up signs: “Thank you for being you – Sir David A” and “Sir David please come to India please”. As he moves from the White House to the World Economic Forum, urging presidents, businesspeople and the public to better protect the environment, he has come to be viewed, in a way he sees as overblown, as a keeper of humanity’s conscience. “That man who saves the world,” is how my seven-year-old daughter describes him.“There will never be another David Attenborough. What makes him special, apart from all his personal qualities, is the timing of his life,” said Fothergill. When Attenborough began travelling the world in the 1950s, Fothergill noted, we were in a different geological epoch, the Holocene. Today, we live in the Anthropocene, an epoch defined by Homo sapiens’ disruptive dominance of the planet. “He’s seen more of the natural world than any human being that has ever lived on the planet and he’s also seen more change than anyone else. And he feels a responsibility.”Despite the adulation, one charge has dogged Attenborough for decades. Critics argue that he has built himself a unique storytelling platform, only to fail to tell the most important story of all: the destructive impact of people on the planet. But one reason Attenborough has thrived on screen for seven decades is because he has always sensed how attitudes are changing, and moved with the times. For a long time, he maintained that his programmes must showcase the wonders of the natural world, and not speak of the human one. Now his newest series are filled with urgent messages about environmental destruction. Still, he resists the idea that he has changed he prefers to say that it is the public mood that has transformed. After a lifetime of caution, almost despite himself, he has become a leading champion for action.Attenborough fell in love with the natural world as a boy, exploring his way through his neighbourhood in Leicester, looking for bugs, insects and amphibians. The middle child of three brothers, he grew up in a family of teachers. His father was principal of University College, Leicester. His mother was a talented pianist. Education was revered. When I met Attenborough in the spring, he spoke of his boyhood passions – keeping tanks of tropical fish, venturing across northern England on his bike as a young teen, alone, in search of fossils.To this day, Attenborough is still a collector – of tribal art, books and music – but although more than a dozen species are named after him, including a flightless weevil, Trigonopterus Attenboroughi, and a genus of dinosaur, Attenborosaurus, he is not an authority on natural history. “Everyone thinks he’s an amazing naturalist,” said the producer and writer Mary Colwell, who worked with him at the Natural History Unit in the 2000s. “He isn’t at all. He’s a great storyteller. Everyone thinks he makes these programmes. He doesn’t – but without him they wouldn’t sparkle in the way they do.”Attenborough agrees. “Work and reputation get separated,” he said. Forty years ago, he travelled around the world three times in order to make his groundbreaking series Life on Earth. He wrote the script, and every page of the accompanying book. “But now I just write and speak the words. And people say: ‘What was it like when you saw that animal charging in?’ And I say: ‘I wasn’t there. Thirty cameramen worked on this thing.’ I’m given credit for things I don’t do. I am grateful, but I’m also embarrassed.”It is even worse, he said, when viewers assume he is a source of scientific wisdom. “OK, I was a biologist once, but I’m a hopeless birder. If I go out with a birder I keep my mouth shut. I just nod. ‘Mmmm. Mmmm.’ So to use a horrible word, I’ve become a kind of icon. Using it in its original meaning, I’m the image of what they think of as a naturalist. I’m a reasonable naturalist, but I’m not the great all-seeing source of all information, knowledge and understanding.” At times, Attenborough’s self-deprecation almost sounds like imposter syndrome. When I asked him to list his failings as a person, he narrowed his eyes. “I’m too convincing,” he laughed, comparing his own expertise unfavourably to other wildlife broadcasters such as Simon King and Liz Bonnin. “When it comes to, as it were, conning your way through, I’m not bad at it. Never identify things unnecessarily.”Even so, plenty of colleagues recall Attenborough relishing his ability to surprise them with his knowledge. Jonny Keeling, the executive producer of Seven Worlds, One Planet, was excited to show his presenter never-obtained-before footage from China of a golden snub-nosed monkey. “‘Oh yes, Rhinopithecus roxellana,’” remembered Attenborough instantly: he knew all about it and had tried to film it many years before.The only praise Attenborough will accept is for his skill as a storyteller. Robert Attenborough, David’s son and an anthropologist at the University of Cambridge, remembered, as a teenager, “watching him in the raconteur role as a host of a dinner party and admiring the skill with which he would tell a funny story. Sometimes they get slightly improved. That’s something we used to tease him about. Of course he wouldn’t do that, then or now, when making a serious point.”Attenborough’s storytelling has been honed over seven decades in television – and he is, above all, a TV man. After studying natural sciences at Cambridge, he married his university sweetheart, Jane Oriel, and ditched his boring junior publishing job for the glamorous new world of television. He started off behind the camera, after one of his first bosses decided his teeth were too big for a presenter. In 1954, Attenborough travelled to Sierra Leone with Jack Lester, London Zoo’s curator of reptiles, to film a new series, Zoo Quest. The concept was simple: they would catch wild animals – their bounty from Sierra Leone included pythons, bird-eating spiders and their big prize, the bald-headed rockfowl – and bring them back to London to add to the zoo’s collection. At the outset, Attenborough was the producer, director, sound man and animal-wrangler. He only ended up being the presenter because Lester was taken ill after the first episode.Zoo Quest was broadcast in black and white, but the original colour footage, which was later discovered by BBC archivists, is beautiful. Attenborough narrates his encounters in clipped, 1950s, BBC-issue received pronunciation, with little trace of his more expressive later style. Although the colonial animal-snatching conceit of Zoo Quest is extremely dated, each episode focuses as much on the human worlds he visits as the exotic animals. Attenborough’s script is factual, respectful and open-minded his films unsensationally depict nudity, polygamy and other cultural traditions, alongside the animal hunt.Over the next few years, new series of Zoo Quest appeared and Attenborough’s reputation grew. With his keen eye for the perceptions of his TV audience, he adapted cannily to a rapidly expanding industry. By the dawn of the 60s, as he admitted in his autobiography, Zoo Quest was looking “increasingly antiquated”. He realised that it was time for a new approach. His next Quest series, filmed in northern Australia, eschewed attempts to bring animals home and instead depicted the cultural lives of Aboriginal peoples.The trip to Australia inspired him to take a part-time postgraduate degree in anthropology, but he was tempted back to full-time TV work before he could complete it. In 1965, he became controller of BBC Two, an appointment greeted with scepticism by “TV professionals” quoted in newspaper columns of the day. At first, he was considered lightweight, a youthful bit of eye-candy, but he was soon hailed for his “unexpected” success, as a  profile put it. “Everybody forgot I wasn’t just a naturalist – I was always a trained TV man,” he told the paper in 1965. “Hell, I love it. I watch everything. Straight home from the office – switch to BBC Two – see all my babies.”As the channel’s controller and then director of programmes for both BBC channels, Attenborough was a great innovator. In 1967, the government decided that BBC Two would become the first channel to switch to colour, and he set about exploiting this advantage. He put snooker on the channel and helped devise new forms of sport: one-day cricket and rugby league under floodlights. Programmes that emerged under his watch include Dad’s Army, Porridge and Monty Python’s Flying Circus. In 1972, he championed “community programming” that included what has been described as the first sympathetic portrayal of transgender people on British television he even suggested phone-ins to widen audience participation, years before they became a staple of TV and radio.One of his lasting innovations was the all-you-need-to-know documentary, beginning with Kenneth Clark’s Civilisation. Attenborough designed this epic, 12-part series about the history of art and culture to showcase the glory of colour television. These monumental series became known as “sledgehammers”, and there followed uncompromisingly highbrow treatments of human evolution, economics and US history. But Attenborough believed the best subject for sledgehammer treatment was yet to come: natural history.Attenborough’s achievements at BBC Two made him a prime candidate for director-general, the top job at the corporation. But he was tiring of the senior executive’s life – desk-bound, constant meetings – and in the early 70s he resigned. “The fact he didn’t want to stay as an executive and wanted to go back to programming says something very important about him,” his son Robert told me. Attenborough yearned to be more creative, and had seen the thankless politics involved in the top job. “The Archangel Gabriel couldn’t do the DG’s job,” he remarked to me.Instead, he persuaded the BBC that he could create a Civilisation-style treatment of the evolution of plants and animals. This series took three years to make, and the budget was so big that Attenborough had to pitch to US networks for funding. (He still enjoys impersonating a sceptical American TV man aghast at the prospect of funding a series that opened with “slime mould”.)Life on Earth was broadcast for 55 minutes on 13 consecutive Sunday evenings in 1979. It “started quietly,” according to Mike Salisbury, a former producer who worked on the programme. Despite the presence of a safari-suited Attenborough, binoculars around his neck, skipping between exotic locations, the early episodes often feel like a lecture with moving pictures. Our handsome presenter tries to make the best of diagrams of DNA, micro-organisms and 200m-year-old fossils. “A whole lot of worms have left this delicate tracery of trails in what was mud,” he enthuses in the Grand Canyon. Salisbury chuckled at the difficulty of bringing this to life on television: “Fossils, for God’s sake. They don’t even move.”But as its epic story slowly unfolds, the series warms up. The writing is often superb: “Four million animals and plants in the world,” says Attenborough, “four million different solutions to staying alive.” The penultimate episode, on primates, features the first memorable Attenborough “two shot”, where he appears alongside another animal. He joins a grooming session among mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and still has the presence-of-mind to whisper: “There is more meaning and mutual understanding in exchanging a glance with a gorilla than any other animal I know.” Although some facts have changed – we now know there are more than 8m species, not 4m – the series stands the test of time one Cambridge professor still shows his undergraduates the primates episode each year.For old-timers at the BBC, history is ided into before and after Life on Earth. “We hadn’t realised what a game-changer it was going to be,” said Salisbury. “By the end there were 14 million people watching it.” The series established what television executives call the “blue-chip” natural history blockbuster. While the BBC has relinquished its dominance over most genres, it remains the pre-eminent maker of natural history programmes, according to Fothergill. So much of that “is down to David”, he said. Much imitated, these blockbusters are still a huge global export: the BBC will not reveal what profit, if any, these series make, but Planet Earth II and Blue Planet II were sold to more than 235 territories.After the success of Life on Earth, Attenborough spent much of the 80s completing what became a triumvirate of blue-chip behemoths, with The Living Planet exploring ecology and The Trials of Life revealing animal behaviour. He also turned his attention to series about less fashionable subjects: plants, spiders, stick insects and other invertebrates. Audiences liked his enthusiasm, his quick wit and his affection for animals, already evident from his early days bottle-feeding a tiny African bush rat in Zoo Quest.From Natural History Unit veterans such as Salisbury to colleagues today, everyone paints the same picture of Attenborough “in the field”: a team-player, carrying kit, energetic, curious, without vanity, funny, not suffering fools and preternaturally lucky. Everyone has a story about him joining a crew that has lucklessly staked out a target species for two weeks, only for that creature – whether Hungarian mayfly or polar bear – to suddenly hove into view. “I don’t like presenters on the whole. I don’t think they are particularly nice people,” one producer told me. But Attenborough was different. “He’s not a prima donna. He’s not an ego on a stick. He doesn’t need to be now.”By the early 80s, Attenborough’s programmes had been broadcast around the world and he became recognised wherever he went. But he was not yet, to use another label that vexes him, a global superstar. Until recently, when Attenborough’s series were shown on US television, broadcasters would replace his narration with voices they thought an American audience would prefer. In 2010, when Life was broadcast in the US, Oprah Winfrey was the narrator.Viewers tend to assume Attenborough writes every word he says on screen, while TV people think his lines are written for him. The truth is somewhere in between. Attenborough’s scripts are written by production teams, but he is an unusually rigorous editor and rewriter. Even today, Attenborough rewrites each script to fit his own turn of phrase and checks for accuracy. “If I send him a script, he goes through it with a fine-tooth comb. More than any other presenter,” said Mary Colwell. “His attention to detail is incredible and he won’t say anything he doesn’t want to say.”When filming, according to Mike Gunton, Attenborough does not learn his lines precisely. “He looks at it and comes back and says: ‘What do you think if I say it like this?’ His turn of phrase and the way he delivers these turns of phrase – it’s got such power. He has the same genes as his brother,” meaning Richard, the Oscar-winning actor-director, who died in 2014. “I’ve often said he’s as good a performer as his brother,” Gunton said. By his own admission, it took some time for Attenborough to realise just what a threat humankind posed to the environment. When he was younger, he said, people knew of species that had gone extinct, such as the Arabian oryx and the dodo, but “you didn’t perceive it as a major ecological problem. And in point of fact, let’s be honest, if the Hawaiian goose disappears, the world doesn’t actually judder in its revolutions.” It wasn’t until Life on Earth that he came to see that species decline was systemic and “actually the disappearance of the giant panda represented some major change”.For most of his life, Attenborough’s environmentalism has been the old-fashioned, off-screen variety, lending his support to numerous green charities. Ever since he was asked, as a bit of a joke, to open a visitor centre at a nature reserve by the village of Attenborough in Nottinghamshire, in 1966, he has given rousing speeches (I have seen several) at hundreds of events for nature charities across Britain. It is hard to find a visitor centre at a Wildlife Trust nature reserve that does not feature a silver plaque declaring that it was “Opened by Sir David Attenborough”.To his critics, these good deeds do not make up for what they see as Attenborough’s great failing as a broadcaster. Putting the case for the prosecution, the journalist George Monbiot has accused Attenborough of “knowingly creating a false impression of the world” by making films that underplay humanity’s impact on the planet and fail to identify the forces driving mass extinction and the climate crisis. Another environmentalist told me that Attenborough possesses irreproachable integrity, but his long silence on extinction and global warming in his television work has contributed towards a popular knowledge deficit.Richard Mabey, a naturalist who worked in television before almost single-handedly reviving British nature writing, has long made a version of this argument. “When Life on Earth came out in 1979, and The Living Planet five years later, I was concerned about the fact that this wasn’t a place I recognised,” Mabey told me. “What one saw was magnificent, but it was what one didn’t see – no humans, no environmental degradation. It was like an idealised biosphere on another planet.” Once, in the early 80s, Mabey bumped into Attenborough at a lunch. “I asked him, genuinely curious, why this picture of the planet was so devoid of environmental strife? He said, very simply: ‘We wouldn’t have got the viewers, they would have turned off.’ I was quite distressed.”TV executives repeat Attenborough’s argument today. A blue-chip series costs millions to produce and requires global funding. BBC programme-makers are terrified of being seen as “political”. At the launch of Seven Worlds, One Planet, Keeling insisted that it’s not “preachy”. As Miles Barton, a long-standing Attenborough producer, put it: “The more preachy you are, the lower the numbers are going to be.” The lower the numbers, the less money the series will make, the less funding for the next. Mabey understood this equation. “Attenborough has power over the audience,” he said. “I’m not sure he has power over the money men. My initial worry about him not including environmental disasters in his early series may have been less his personal choice than corporate pressure.”As a young producer, it was drilled into Attenborough that private convictions must not be aired in public. He has always upheld the values of the liberal establishment – avowedly internationalist and anti-populist in his veneration of expertise – and taken the traditional BBC line on party-political neutrality. “I’m not a political chap, I know about bugs,” he protested when asked about Brexit in 2017. (When pushed, he revealed that he voted to remain.)Like most in the Natural History Unit, Attenborough has also long defended his work with a “show the wonders and then people will care” argument. When we spoke earlier this year, Attenborough put it more bluntly: “People ought to be concerned because they think the natural world is important. If they know nothing about the natural world they won’t care a toss.”To a sympathetic observer, the lack of campaigning films in Attenborough’s oeuvre might look like a canny political calculation about the most effective way to shift popular opinion over the long-term. But it may just reflect his temperament. “I made natural history programmes not because I was a rampaging proselytiser preaching about conservation,” he told me. “I like looking at animals and seeing what they do.” Attenborough praises more outspoken broadcasters, such as Chris Packham. “Chris is to be admired, actually, because he would sacrifice his career in the name of something that he thought was important about conservation. He would. And more strength to his elbow,” he said. But that is not Attenborough’s way. He acknowledged that he would “probably not” ever risk getting banned from the BBC.In public, he has always been reserved. Journalists have often noted his refusal to emote in interviews. This image of an emotionally repressed English gentleman, a man of his era, is not his private self at all, says his son. “I regard him as an exception to all the rules of English maleness,” said Robert. “In personal life, he’s not shy with his emotions. I would not see him as a classic English male in that sense – he’s a warmer person, a more expressive person than that.” When Attenborough’s wife, Jane, died 20 years ago, “his grief was intense and fully expressed,” remembered Robert.Even so, his public reticence and natural caution have made the final stage of his career all the more striking.In November 2004, nearly 20 years after the phrase “global warming” was first coined, Attenborough attended a lecture in Belgium given by Ralph Cicerone, an American expert on atmospheric chemistry. The graphs that Cicerone presented, showing the rise in global temperatures, finally convinced Attenborough, beyond any doubt, that humans were responsible for the changing climate. Attenborough insists he was never a sceptic about man-made climate change just cautious. Even after Cicerone’s lecture, he still believed his job was to make programmes about wildlife. He worried that people would think he was setting himself up as an expert on climate science.Attenborough’s output changed, however. This distinction may mystify those beyond the Natural History Unit, but its film-makers distinguish between natural history and “environmental” film-making. The former focus on animal or plant biology and behaviour the latter address environmental issues. Attenborough’s 2006 BBC two-parter, The Truth About Climate Change, was his first to address global warming explicitly. Three years later came How Many People Can Live on Planet Earth?, which reflected his long-standing concern over the rising human population. (Attenborough’s position incurred criticism from some who argued he was focusing more on environmental harm caused by poorer nations rather than over-consumption by wealthier populations.) This year came a new Attenborough BBC documentary, Climate Change: The Facts. Next year, the BBC will broadcast another, Extinction: The Facts.The arrival of Blue Planet II in 2017 heralded a new urgency to Attenborough’s blockbusters, helping transform popular attitudes towards waste and pollution with its images of plastic enveloping a turtle, and albatrosses unwittingly feeding plastic bags to their chicks. When I interviewed Attenborough this spring, his Netflix series Our Planet had not yet been released. It was billed as a significantly more pressing appeal to save the world, and Fothergill, its producer, was keen to assert its environmental credentials. Attenborough, meanwhile, seemed equally keen to assert that it wasn’t so different to his earlier work: “If you forget the flummery and the propaganda and the press releases, what does it do? It shows the most breathtaking sequences you’ve ever seen – beauty, wonder, spectacles filmed in a way that you never saw before, with drones and in fabulous colour, with surging music, and so on, and then at the end, it says it’s all in danger. That’s what they do. I’m not ashamed of that. I think it’s a perfectly valid thing.”But the strange thing, when you sat down to watch Our Planet, was that it did not match Attenborough’s billing. Each episode began with him discussing the moon landing. “Since then, the human population has more than doubled,” his voiceover continued. “This series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain, and reveal what we must preserve to ensure that people and nature thrive.” The series returned, relentlessly, to this manifesto. It explained the importance of rainforest for a habitable climate, and almost no stunning sequence of wild animals came without Attenborough emphasising the precariousness of their continued existence. Likewise, in Seven Worlds, One Planet, the environmental messages are no longer restricted to an appeal at the end of each episode. The first story about the impact of climate change comes 16 minutes into the opening episode. Throughout, there are sequences that highlight the human actions – climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, poaching – causing Earth’s sixth great planetary extinction. “We are a behavioural wildlife show and we’ve got a whole sequence without an animal in it – that’s a remarkable change,” said the series producer, Scott Alexander.This shift in Attenborough’s work reflects a response by film-makers, and particularly the Natural History Unit, to accusations that they have pulled punches in the past. Yet, as his protestations suggest, being “environmental” has not come easily to Attenborough. “I don’t think he’s naturally an environmentalist at all,” said one former colleague. “He’s not eloquent when it comes to environmentalism. But you can’t take away his intelligence, his understanding of the zeitgeist and his integrity.” According to the source, Attenborough was initially reluctant to include the plastics story in Blue Planet II, worrying once again that “it would be a turn-off”. If that was the case – and senior BBC executives deny it – by the time the series was broadcast in 2017, Attenborough was fully behind the plastics episode. “David really led on the plastics thing, talking about plastics before the series went out,” said the producer Miles Barton.At 93, Attenborough is more in demand than ever. Susan, his daughter, keeps a watchful eye on him and tries in vain to scale back his speaking engagements and charitable commitments. (He has never put his name to any commercial product.) The BBC want him to narrate Planet Earth III, but he will be 96 when the time comes. Meanwhile, he devotes most of his considerable stamina to appealing for radical action to tackle the climate crisis and bioersity loss. In Poland, at the UN climate change summit in 2018, he was chosen to represent the world’s people in addressing leaders from almost 200 nations. At Davos, in early 2019, he questioned the wisdom of perpetual economic growth: only “a madman or an economist” would cling to this notion, he argued.Earlier this month, Attenborough launched Seven Worlds, One Planet with an exhausting round of interviews to journalists from six continents, while a police helicopter buzzed over Extinction Rebellion protests on the streets of London. At the premiere, when I asked if he was comfortable about his films inspiring Extinction Rebellion, he replied sharply: “Extinction Rebellion doesn’t have the monopoly of people who care about the planet. That’s a section of people who care about the planet, but everybody should care about the planet. We’re citizens of the planet. We have the dominance of it and we ought to care about it.”Attenborough has been supportive of school climate strikers, and likes to suggest that the planet now belongs in younger hands.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation, which grants wishes to critically ill children, also paid about $11,000 for a “bat princess” costume party for her.Turner was arrested on Friday at a Denver-area hotel and held without bond, the Douglas county sheriff’s office said. It is not clear if she has an attorney who could speak on her behalf.Olivia’s cause of death was not immediately clear. It was originally attributed to intestinal failure, according to the indictment issued on Thursday and first reported by KUSA-TV.Her body was exhumed last year, and an autopsy found no physical evidence of that illness or other conditions that Turner claimed the girl suffered, including seizure disorder and a build-up of fluid in cavities deep within the brain. Olivia’s death is now listed as undetermined.Investigators say Olivia had been using a feeding tube and was admitted in July 2017 to Children’s Hospital Colorado, where doctors said her nutrition was deficient.One doctor told investigators that Turner wanted to withdraw all medical care and artificial feeding for her daughter because her quality of life was so bad. He said she insisted that he sign a “do not resuscitate” order for her daughter.Doctors had said Olivia wouldn’t be able to survive on IV nutrition, and Turner was given the option of taking her home on hospice care, according to the indictment. Olivia died a few weeks later.Several doctors who were interviewed said Olivia did not have a terminal condition. The girl started getting treatment at the hospital in 2013 after moving from Texas, where Turner’s husband stayed behind.The investigation into Olivia’s death began after doctors at the hospital became suspicious last year after Turner brought in her older daughter because of “bone pain”, according to the indictment.During an interview, investigators said Turner spontaneously brought up Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a psychological disorder in which parents or caregivers seek attention from the illness of their children or dependents and sometimes cause them injuries that require attention.“That has never been my case, like at all, whatsoever,” she said in the interview.During the investigation, authorities separated Turner from her older daughter to see if the girl would still report the same symptoms. The daughter has not had any additional medical problems or complaints of pain since October 2018, the indictment said.It’s not immediately clear how old the girl is or whom she lives with now.The daughters were insured by Medicaid, and Turner is accused of fraudulently obtaining about $539,000 worth of care from the government-funded program.Children’s Hospital Colorado issued a statement saying it declined to comment to avoid compromising the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d1b523379dd79b4f939eb20dbfeb7778893df5/0_139_4170_2502/master/4170.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a88c40683405a99e7e5e93a5c5c73d48","title":"catholic church lift ban on female priests activists say","story":"Campaigners gather outside Vatican as church struggles with shortage of priestsCampaigners have gathered in Rome to call for the lifting of a ban on female priests that would “save the Catholic Church” where it is failing to ordain enough men.Activists from the Women’s Ordination Worldwide (Wow) group protested outside the Vatican on Tuesday as the church’s hierarchy pondered the idea of allowing married men in the Amazon to become priests in order to plug the shortage in the region.The activists argue that ordaining women priests would solve the issue as effectively and should be prioritised.‌”Empowering women would save the church,” said Kate McElwee, a Rome-based representative of Wow. “Our church and our Earth are in crisis – and empowering women in roles that they are already serving in their communities is a solution. We’re advocating for equality and that includes ordination.”The church has been struggling with a shortage of priests for decades, particularly in Europe and North America, which have had sharp falls in church membership as well as devastating sexual abuse scandals. In some places, priests have been moved from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, where the church is flourishing, to fill vacancies.‌While Pope Francis has opened up more discussion about women’s roles and appointed women in key Vatican positions, the topic of them becoming priests is still very much taboo. A huge number of women serve within the church around the world, outnumbering men in some countries, but they are denied the privilege of voting at Vatican synods, such as the one on the Amazon currently taking place, because they are not ordained.“The consequences of this massive injustice are far-reaching beyond the church,” said Miriam Duignan, from Wow’s unit in the UK. “It’s not just a matter of who stands at the altar each Sunday and blesses the bread … women are silenced and sidelined, and this has a tidal effect beyond the priesthood in terms of how women are seen.”The campaigners, who held umbrellas to shield themselves from the afternoon sun, said they were often insulted during protests, with one Rome police officer telling them to move away and close their umbrellas because they featured a “women priests” slogan.Their biggest fear over the idea of allowing married men in the Amazon to be ordained is that the many women who already carry out ministerial roles in the region could be supplanted by men.“The church would not be alive in the Amazon if it wasn’t for women,” said Duignan. “They are undertaking priestly roles without having the title of priest.”Pat Brown, also from the UK, said the situation for women serving the church in the developing world is more acute. “It’s not so bad for us but they suffer this misogyny: the church endorses sexism.”The Amazon synod, which wraps up on 27 October, has discussed the role of women in the region, with Cardinal Cláudio Hummes, the president of the synod, proposing that “a suitable ministry” be established for “women community leaders”. Many bishops have supported the ordination of married men despite criticism from more conservative factions.The pope has previously said he would be open to allowing married men to be ordained in areas where there was a scarcity of priests, while maintaining the requirement for most priests to be celibate. He has also spoken about “allowing space for women in the church at all levels”.As the event draws to a close, the Vatican on Tuesday lambasted the two extreme conservative Catholics who stole Amazonian statues from a church near the Vatican and dumped them in the Tiber River.The wooden statues, which depict a pregnant woman and represent an indigenous Virgin Mary, were presented to the pope at the start of the synod but critics consider them to be pagan. Paolo Ruffini, the Vatican’s head of communications, said the theft was “a stupid stunt”.The four statues were stolen from the Santa Maria in Traspontina church on Monday and the stunt filmed by the perpetrators.“In the name of tradition and doctrine, an effigy of maternity and the sacredness of life was dumped in contempt,” said Ruffini, adding that the “violent and intolerant gesture” had “passed from hate on social media to action”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77dfa0e506ab5b385fb3e23e9232d260e0cfd97d/0_88_4797_2879/master/4797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58fba691979d985422d7ea8fd42e8f3b","title":"danish lighthouse put on wheels to move it away from eroding sea","story":"Rubjerg Knude used to be 200 metres away from coast before sand shifting and erosionA 120-year-old lighthouse in Denmark, at risk from North Sea erosion of the country’s north-west coastline, was on Tuesday wheeled back from the cliff edge.When the 23-metre (75ft) Rubjerg Knude lighthouse was first lit in 1900, it was roughly 200 metres from the coast that distance shrank to six metres.Arne Boelt, the local mayor, said many things could go wrong when moving the defunct building, which weighs about 1,000 tons and sits on a cliff. “But it’s worth the risk ... the alternative would be to dismantle the lighthouse.”The Danish environment minister, Lea Wermelin, called the lighthouse “a national treasure” in an attempt to justify the 5m kroner (£580,000) spent by the ministry to save it. Boelt and the town of Hjørring also have chipped in to foot the bill.Moving the lighthouse, with the help of rails and wheels, was expected to last 10 hours, at a speed of eight metres an hour. The building in its original position was at risk from erosion and shifting sands.The lighthouse ceased operating in 1968, when sands slowly buried two adjacent buildings, and was briefly turned into a museum. The surrounding dunes still attract more than 250,000 visitors each year.The move, broadcast live on Danish news outlets, depended on the weather, which was currently fair in the region. Thirty minutes into the operation, the lighthouse had been moved 1.4 metres.In 2008, a nearby church was dismantled to prevent it from falling into the sea. The Romanesque Mårup church, built in about 1250 on a cliff, was used as one of the filming locations for the 1987 film Babette’s Feast, which became the first Danish film to win an Academy award for best foreign language film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/887edc6bc3e6e0f3a29d8a34ed7d49f9c56b1e45/0_0_5701_3421/master/5701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2e05f6186b24264799b0d6ed1446619","title":"germany berlin cabinet agree five year rent freeze","story":"Proposal to counter rising housing costs still requires approval by state parliamentBerlin’s state cabinet has agreed on a rent freeze for five years to counter rising housing costs in the German capital.The city’s leftwing coalition government wants to freeze the rent for apartments built before 2014, according to a report by the German news agency dpa.Only a minority of Berliners own their homes or apartments and rent has been rising sharply in recent years, forcing many to move outside the city.The city had been a low-rent mecca for many years, after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 opened the gates to the economically depressed former communist east of the city.

His government brought in a carbon tax to fight the climate crisis – but also paid billions to rescue a stalled pipeline project.MacCalder said he felt Trudeau has lost much of his appeal – likening the prime minister to Barack Obama, the former US president who swapped boundless hope for a bleaker pragmatism in his second term – but he nonetheless voted for the Liberals on Monday.“I think: a good thing for the country and the ability to move forward,” he said of the result.Trudeau’s own father, Pierre Trudeau, also served his second term of office at the head of a minority government.But the younger Trudeau took what experts say is the weakest popular vote ever, in a result which reflects an increasingly fractured country.“Parties are supposed to exist to build bridges and to keep us together. They’re not supposed to exist to leverage different parts of the electorate … to never try to compromise or grow. This is bad,” Turnbull, the professor, said.Not a single Liberal was elected in the western Prairie provinces, which Turnbull called a “major problem” for Trudeau.But while the Conservatives were able to make marginal gains, Monday’s result marked a clear defeat for Scheer, whose campaign pledges to quash carbon pricing legislation and cut taxes failed to resonate with voters.Scheer, who had openly mused about winning a majority in the days leading up to the election, nonetheless issued a stark warning to the Liberals on Monday evening.“Mr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready and we will win,” he told supporters at his concession speech.But his own party’s poor performance is likely to raise questions about Scheer’s viability as a leader, after he failed to catalyze voter frustration and topple a wounded Trudeau. Heading into the final weeks, the incumbent prime minister was fending off attacks for his role in the SNC Lavalin scandal, as well as apologizing for images showing him in blackface.“If Scheer couldn’t win now – when will he?” said Turnbull, pointing out that the Tory leader failed to grow his base beyond the Prairies.While Monday’s result marks a significant erosion of support for the prime minister, the narrow victory will be enough to ensure Trudeau’s signature policies – including the national carbon tax – remain in place.Now, all eyes will be on how Trudeau reaches out to parties with a “confidence-and-supply” deal, in which junior partners support the government on inidual pieces of legislation, as opposed to joining in a fully-fledged coalition.The deal-making will leave the balance of power in the hands of the New Democratic party and the nominally separatist Bloc Québécois.While it holds the necessary amount of seats the to prop up a Liberal government, the NDP is also cash-strapped and struggling, having literally mortgaged its office in Ottawa to help fund its national campaign.Singh – who failed to convert immense personal popularity into electoral wins – has made a commitment to fighting climate change and funding healthcare key requirements, meaning Trudeau could steer his government further to the left.Since Yves-François Blanchet took over as leader in January, the Bloc has roared back into relevance– and is also keen to do business with Trudeau. With 32 seats in parliament, it has more clout than the NDP. While Blanchet vowed to fight any effort that would negatively affect the francophone province, including any pipeline projects, he also left the door open to supporting the Liberals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/193548067d328cf81f368e535525940270d1e637/0_125_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9975b2d6ba19ef62b6e8247fcd00f4e0","title":"kings sacking of consort highlights power of thai monarchy","story":"Vajiralongkorn wields dominant control over his country’s politics and mediaWhen Thailand’s 67-year-old King Maha Vajiralongkorn stripped his royal consort of her titles on Monday, it sent shockwaves through Thai society. Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi had spent several years as a companion to the monarch alongside the now queen, but had only been given her official title in July.The palace claimed her title was stripped because Sineenat, 34, tried to convince the king to elevate her to the same standing as his fourth wife and current queen, Suthida Tidjai, 41.All images of her disappeared from the palace website and an unverified Instagram account in her name was shut down overnight.Thai kings were historically polygamous, with consorts appointed in addition to queens, but until this year the title had not been used since the country became a constitutional monarchy in 1932.While Sineenat was the first officially named consort to a Thai king since the 1920s, she was not the first woman in Vajiralongkorn’s life to lose her position. In 2014 he stripped Srirasmi Akrapongpreecha, his third wife, of most of her titles and had members of her family arrested. His second wife, Sujarinee Vivacharawongse, fled to the US after Vajiralongkorn denounced her in 1996 and disowned their four sons.The king was able to do all this because he wields enormous power over politicians, the press and the legal system. Thailand’s draconian lèse-majesté laws make it illegal to criticise the monarchy to any degree.According to her official royal biography, now removed from the palace website, Sineenat, nicknamed Koi, was formerly known as Niramon Ounprom. She was born in north Thailand’s Nan province on 26 January 1985. In 2008 she graduated with a nursing degree from Bangkok’s Royal Thai Army nursing college, then worked as a nurse at the Phramongkutklao and Ananda Mahidol hospitals.In 2015 she signed up to the Ratchawallop police retainers, a unit acting as a pool of bodyguards to Vajiralongkorn that reportedly has hundreds of thousands of members. Sineenat received military training and obtained a private pilot’s licence.By 2016, the year in which Vajiralongkorn became king, video and photos of him and Sineenat together in Germany started appearing online. They showed the pair wearing skimpy clothes and fake tattoos as they cruised malls and tourist spots.Sineenat’s appointment on 28 July this year made Vajiralongkorn the first Thai monarch since King Rama VI, who ruled from 1910 to 1925, to publicly acknowledge multiple female companions. Her consort ceremony was followed by the palace releasing images of her piloting a military plane and shooting a gun. Such images previously had been reserved for the king’s close relatives, and they resembled the military-style photos of Queen Suthida released for her birthday.The palace said Sineenat had “expressed her opposition and exerted her pressure in every possible way” with regards to Suthida being crowned queen in May this year. Vajiralongkorn’s power shows no sign of abating and he has proved to be an assertive constitutional monarch. His face peers from shrines and billboard advertisements in Bangkok, the latter placed by companies declaring loyalty. A schmaltzy video montage of the king growing up, featuring images of members of the public crawling at his feet, plays in cinemas before film screenings. Audience members are compelled to stand for it.This month he demanded that some of Thailand’s most powerful army units come under his command, giving him military control unprecedented for a monarch in the country in modern times. This met almost no resistance in parliament.

It also cements Moscow’s new role as prime powerbroker in the Middle East as the US’ influence in the region wanes.Turkish troops in areas of north-east Syria seized since the start of the 9 October offensive will remain in situ, and Russian troops and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier, effectively fulfilling the goal of Turkey’s Operation Peace Spring: the dilution of Kurdish control over the 270-mile (440km) border corridor.Russian military police and Syrian border guards controlled by President Bashar al-Assad will from Wednesday at noon facilitate the removal of SDF fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles from their positions on the border, the Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said after their respective presidents announced the agreement to reporters.The SDF has 150 hours to withdraw, a joint statement said, and then Turkish and Russian soldiers will begin joint patrols of the entire border area to a depth of 10km with the exception of the de-facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli. The deal appears to also include the contested strategically key town of Manbij as well as the important Kurdish town Kobane. It made no mention of the long-term presence of troops loyal to Assad, now also present in the proposed border zone.No comment on the deal from the SDF or Kurdish political leaders was immediately forthcoming. The umbrella force’s commander-in-chief, Mazloum Kobane, confirmed earlier on Tuesday that his fighters had withdrawn from the border strip between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, the two towns bearing the brunt of the Turkish attack, hours before the poorly observed US-brokered ceasefire ended.The chain of events triggered by Donald Trump’s 6 October announcement that US troops would leave Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria has has left Moscow the most powerful player in Syria’s complex war, now in its ninth year.Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the SDF, and soldiers belonging to Assad are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them.Trump has been widely criticised for his decision to pull back the remaining 1,000 US special forces from the region, which in effect green-lighted the Turkish attack on the SDF, the US’s ground partner in the five-year-campaign to defeat Isis. Ankara, however, has long maintained the main Kurdish unit in the SDF is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).As a result of the Turkish offensive, Syria’s Kurdish officials struck a deal with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements in the border area.Ankara will be pleased that Moscow has persuaded Damascus to cede it control over more territory in the north-east, breaking up Kurdish control. In return, Moscow appears to have extracted commitments from the Turkish delegation that Turkey will respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.Assad himself has repeatedly vowed to reunite his entire country under Damascus’s rule. In a symbolic visit to the north-western province of Idlib on Tuesday – territory the regime now occupies for the first time in years – he called Erdoğan “a thief” and said he was ready to support any popular resistance against Turkey’s invasion.“We are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later,” he told troops, adding that Kurdish fighters would be granted an amnesty if they returned to the fold of the Syrian government.At least 120 civilians in Syria and 20 in Turkey have died as a result of the almost two-week old assault, with 176,000 Syrians displaced by the violence, the UN said on Tuesday. Intermittent fighting has continued despite a US-brokered ceasefire announced by Mike Pence, the American vice-president, on a visit to Ankara last Thursday.Last week’s US-Turkish agreement did not specify the zone’s size, where Turkey also plans to repatriate up to 2 million of its 3.6 million Syrian refugee population.Previous agreements between Washington and Ankara over a safe zone along the Syria-Turkish border floundered time and again over erging definitions of the area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d36f311b050937f3f67298334e91d016698fc863/0_460_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ede765455753c9447cc23842c947c946","title":"what a day to be gay in northern ireland joy for couples at historic change","story":"As the law changed at midnight, same-sex couples celebrated the culmination of a rollercoaster campaignAmanda Milnes proposed to her partner Christina Conlon in January when same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland was illegal.

It’s just a phenomenal feeling knowing that I will marry Christina, the love of my life, and celebrate until our feet can’t hold us up any longer.”Same-sex couples across Northern Ireland erupted in jubilation at the stroke of midnight on Monday when a law extending marriage equality took effect.It was the culmination of a rollercoaster campaign to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK in the face of opposition from the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) and other social conservatives.“We stayed up till 12 and counted down the seconds like it was New Year’s Eve,” said Milnes, a bank worker. “Today we can just take a deep breath and say it’s actually legal, we’ve the same rights as everybody else.”She proposed to Conlon, 30, during a ski holiday, unsure if same-sex marriage would become legal. “Now we can start planning the wedding. We have our guest list sorted. We can go shopping for wedding dresses knowing we’re not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law.”England and Wales enshrined marriage equality in 2013, followed by the Republic of Ireland in 2015. Opinion polls showed a big majority favoured same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, but the DUP blocked change at the Stormont assembly.Then in 2017, a dispute between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed the assembly, creating a vacuum. MPs at Westminster stepped in by passing an amendment in July by a backbench Labour MP, Conor McGinn, extending marriage equality to Northern Ireland.Monday was the last chance for opponents of change to restore Stormont and avert the legislation. The DUP and others attempted a recall to block the extension of abortion rights – a far more contentious change – but the effort failed, allowing liberalisation of both marriage equality and abortion rights.Julian Smith, Northern Ireland’s secretary of state, said the first gay marriage was expected the week of Valentine’s day 2020.“You don’t grow up saying ‘I can’t wait to have a civil partnership’,” said Cara McCann, director of Here NI, a charity that advocates for lesbian and bisexual women. “You grow up saying ‘I want to be married’. They’re different things.”She and her partner Amanda McGurk, 39, had a civil partnership ceremony in Belfast in February. They plan to convert that into a marriage once guidelines are published, said McGurk. “It’s validation for us.”Overt homophobia has ebbed in Northern Ireland. Pride parades have grown in popularity, drawing corporate sponsors, clerics, families, politicians and police. The murder in April of Lyra McKee, a writer and LGBTQ activist who was planning to marry her partner, Sara Canning, channelled grief into demands for change.Anthony Flynn, 28, and his partner Cory Quinn, 25, celebrated the legislation with a bottle of prosecco.“I was incredibly cynical and sceptical of it passing right up until the last moment because we’ve been pushed back so many times in the past,” said Flynn, a software developer and Green party councillor. “Today shows that progress can be made.”After six years together marriage is on the cards, said Flynn. “I’m threatening to pop the question. Both of us come from a traditional family life where marriage is a building block in growing up. I’d be a traditionalist – I want to marry the person I love and build a family around that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01da50756b329b46660b4c77fdf6eb79f79e23d2/896_126_4385_2631/master/4385.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c405ab22a9c4ad43991dc754022579","title":"trudeau triumphs in canadian election in pictures","story":"Justin Trudeau has won a second term as Canada’s prime minister, losing his majority but delivering unexpectedly strong results despite having been weakened by a series of scandals that tarnished his image as a liberal icon"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052663.1571235523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"customers at their wits end over eir","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn her interactions with Eir, a reader, Fidelma, dealt with “many rude reps and two nice ones”. Photograph: Alan BetsonRegular readers will know that Eir has featured on this page quite a bit over the last year and although the company has promised a dramatic overhaul of its customer service department, the complaints are still coming in and we have two this week. “I am really sorry that I am asking of your time to help me with this,” starts a mail from a reader called Fidelma.“I wish I could take care of the matter myself but I am at my wits’ end. I recently moved home to take care of my mum (widow), who shattered her pelvis in a fall. I am a single mum of three and having broadband is a luxury item for us,” she continues.“At my previous address we had Sky and there was never an issue. When I moved, Sky couldn’t provide a service due to the rural setting. I contacted Eir on July 19th and spoke to a rep who assured me once I gave my bank details that no money would be taken out of my account until they could assure me of a service.”On that call Fidelma was told to wait until she received a text from the company and when she did she was told she would then have to follow up with a call five working days later. “Needless to say I received no text or anything further. On August 11th €59.15 was removed from my account. On the 12th and 15th of August I spent two solid days on the phone to Eir and also emailing them contacting them on Facebook Messenger and web chat.”She says she dealt with “many rude reps and two nice ones”.Each time she spoke to Eir she was assured that “I had no account and everything was cancelled and I would be issued a refund in 60 days.” That did not happen.“I have now received another email from them with a new invoice. As it is the weekend the customer care is not open. Due to previous interactions after relaying my situations multiple times on the web chat and Facebook Messenger, I have been told my issue can be only dealt with over the phone.”She says the customer care line is open between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Friday when she is at work and she says she would expect to be “held in a queue for over an hour”.She says she really believed that after spending “two whole days” previously on the phone “that last time that it would sort it. The stress this is causing me is unfair and unnecessary. I am trying to work, take care of my mother and my daughters and cannot see how I can resolve this. If I cancel the direct debit (which I never authorised to be used as such) will they hand it over to a debt collector? All for a service I never received. I am still without broadband as I am terrified that I cannot escape Eir.”She says reps have hung up the phone on her and another asked her: “What do you want me to do about it?” She says she has been promised that people would return her calls but “nothing and no help has come”.Her mail concludes with a plaintive “Please, please help – it may not seem like much money but to me it is a lot and I am worried it will continue. I don’t know what else to do and the stress and the lack of any progress is like a nightmare.”Phone cut offAnd then there was this one.“One year ago in June 2018 Eir cut off my contract phone and I lost my number,” writes Maxine. The company was supposed to cancel her broadband and her TV but she wanted to keep her mobile phone. Instead “everything was cancelled”.She says this caused her a lot of distress as she was moving country and while she was going to be overseas – in Lebanon – she needed an Irish phone as she has a serious medical condition which was being treated in Ireland.To replace her old number she got a pay-as-you-go phone also with Eir and passed the details to her medical team in Ireland.Maxine has a brain tumour “and had surgery before I left Ireland in June. My bloods were not correct this summer and I am awaiting a call from my team,” she writes.She lost her phone service at the end of September and has tried to resolve the issue using Eir’s web chat but every time she has tried it has been unsuccessful. “Even today my chat was dropped three times and have been told different stories as to why my service is not working.”She has been told there is not enough credit on her account . She says there is €20 on the account and she has been told her phone package does not allow to have the phone as it is set up.She says the problems have been compounded as she accesses her Irish bank accounts using her Irish mobile phone.On the day she wrote to us - last Monday - she said she had spent two hours on webchat with Eir and was then told she would have to wait another 48 hours to be contacted by technical support. “I was reduced to tears in front of my 11- and eight-year-old sons. I am really distressed over this and at my wits’ end. I really hope your influence will help.”We contacted the company and asked not only about these problems but about how improvements in its customer care offering were coming along.“A year ago we began the process to bring all customer care roles back in-house, a huge programme of work which included the building of a new centre in Sligo, on a green field site and the upgrading and expansion of two more new care centres in Cork and Limerick. Some 1,200 employees have been hired and trained across care, retail and sales. Those people are now established in their roles and some have been promoted to team lead and trainer positions in recent months,” a spokeswoman said. \u0026nbsp“We are proud of all that has been achieved so far but this programme is by no means complete. We will continue to invest to meet our goal of a best in class care service for our customers. We have seen huge improvements in the quality of care our customers are receiving, but of course not every interaction is perfect. We have reached out to the customers you have highlighted to us, to apologise that they did not receive the standard of care they should expect. We have resolved those issues and will continue to work to ensure the betterment of our care service.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShopping online from ChinaNext up there is a reader called Bryan who is dismayed at the quality of some clothes he bought from China and with the aftercare he received.Bryan says that when the clothes arrived “they were the wrong size, bad quality, had defects, did not match the description, etc”.So he immediately wrote to the company seeking a return address and a refund “which they have not given me. One item never arrived and they will not refund me for the item. Instead they are insisting they will resend the item which I have refused but to no avail.”Bryan wonders if he has any rights when it comes to getting his money back. “I am not entirely sure the company are Chinese as the website doesn’t say this, but the goods arrived from China. I had a look at their refund policy and it contained gems like ‘Note that we can accept goods only in case it is hanging by the wall.’”None of that sounds great. But it does serve as a timely reminder that when it comes to shopping online you need to have your wits about you.When you buy from a website based in the European Union you have many rights thanks to a consumer rights directive which came into force across in 2014.If you buy something online and it is faulty, you have exactly the same rights as if you bought it in a shop and you are entitled to a repair, a refund or a replacement. Under the directive, an online seller must give you specific information, including the price, any taxes that may apply, delivery costs and details of what to do if you change your mind. You also have a cooling-off period of at least 14 days, starting from the date you receive the order. Before the end of the 14 days, an order can be cancelled and the item returned.You also have extra rights if your goods are not delivered on time. Generally speaking, online retailers have 30 days to get your stuff to you unless you agree otherwise.However all of these rights apply only to transactions that happen within the EU. So if you buy clothes from Dave’s Dodgy Deals in Doha you can expect your rights to be significantly diminished.And that is what is happening here.More and more people are buying direct from Chinese sites, lured by the promise of dramatic discounts but – as in so many areas – if something seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true.When shopping in sites outside the EU – either those based in Beijing or (soon) Bristol, you will need to be wary of unexpected charges such as increased taxes and inflated delivery charges. There may also be safety concerns about some products as something sold from outside the EU does not have to meet certain standards.And when you buy from outside the EU you don’t automatically have rights enshrined in law to return an item even if it is faulty or not as described.Bryan has fought a good fight but he could still end up on the losing side. He can’t even arrange for a chargeback on the items which have already been delivered because his bank is unlikely to entertain him, although be might be able to convince his bank to give him money back for the items which never arrived.All of this is not to say that people should never buy from China or other countries that offer little by way of protection but it is always going to be a gamble, so you might be well advised to keep your spending under a certain limit and spend only as much as you are willing to lose should everything go pear-shaped.It is also worth bearing in mind when buying clothes that sizes in different parts of the world can vary and a large in one country can be a medium in another one. If you are buying from far-flung places, check the feedback and reviews of the seller and their products and if you can’t find contact details before you buy then maybe you shouldn’t be buying there at all, no matter how good the deal seems.Good-news storiesWe like to feature good-news stories on the page and would do so more frequently it we could. We got two in the space of two days last week that we are delighted to highlight.“I would like to commend the National Concert Hall for their resolution of an issue I had with a considerably out-of-date voucher,” starts a mail from a reader by the name of Richie Ryan.“Their IT system didn’t allow the voucher to be processed but the manager issued me two complimentary tickets for the concert I wished to attend,” he says. “I suspect the two tickets may have cost slightly more than my voucher. Either way I feel like a winner. That’s not something I often feel when using vouchers.”And then there is Brittany Ferries, which another reader, Eddie Duggan, says provided him and his family with some “outstanding service”.“My family of three travelled the RoscoffCork route on October 12th,” he writes. “Shortly before boarding, my daughter was taken severely ill. We informed the check-in staff and they provided a wheelchair to help her board, they upgraded us to a vastly superior cabin at no extra charge, and provided a crew member to take my daughter to her cabin.”He says the ferry company also provided him and his family with a disembarkation assistance.“We can only try to express our gratitude to the check-in staff and crew members for their assistance and for their cheerful , helpful and friendly manners. Can you please pass on our thanks to all your staff involved?”Yes. Yes, we can."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059571.1571771988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin bus network redesign q a","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNumber  44 bus in Enniskerry: Almost all the routes in the new plan have been tweaked.What is the Dublin Area Bus Network Redesign?It is a reassessment of all the current bus routes in Dublin in an attempt to create a new more coherent service for the capital that will eliminate overlapping routes and improve journey times.Why is it being done?There has never been a complete overhaul of the capital’s bus services before. As the city has expanded, new bus services have been added into the network, and some routes have scrapped over the years, but these changes have been piecemeal and reactive, and no one before has sat down and looked at how the overall system works.How will it work?At its most basic level the existing route numbering system for all buses will be scrapped. A new lettering system from A to H will identify eight “spines” though the city, with buses running every four to eight minutes. Numbers would be used to indicate different branches of a spine for example while all A buses would pass through Terenure, the A1 would continue to Knocklyon while the A2 would go to Tallaght.So it’s just replacing numbers with letters?There’s more. There would also be 10 new orbital services, not running through the city centre, that would also run frequently. Currently orbital services in Dublin are very limited, with passengers often having to travel into the city and then return in a similar direction to access a neighbouring suburb. A high frequency inner orbital route, line O would run on a loop between the canals to enable fast travel around the city centre.At the outer edges of the city, beyond the M50, infrequent, slow radial routes running all the way into the centre would be scrapped and replaced by short, frequent local routes that would feed into the spines that do serve the city.Wait this is all starting to sound very familiar?The NTA published this plan in July 2018 and then opened it to public consultation. On the basis of those submissions they have produced a revised design.So was it popular?It was not. Almost 50,000 people made submissions in relation to the plan, including almost every politician in Dublin among them Minister for Transport Shane Ross. Most of the submissions could be defined as objections or complaints. Almost 45 per cent of people complained about the loss of existing service 26 per cent complained about having to change buses 25 per cent raised concerns about the impact on the elderly or people with disabilities 18 per cent said there would additional inconvenience, ie having to walk further to a bus stop.How has the NTA responded?Almost all the routes in the plan have been tweaked to some degree. The biggest change is an increase in direct routes to the city so people won’t have to change buses to get into town. In the 2018 plan up to 15 per cent of direct services were being lost, that’s now down to just 5 per cent. Routes to schools, hospitals or shops have also been reinstated and in some cases increased.And what about the trees?The proposals for felling trees or acquiring parts of front gardens or restricting private cars, are not part of the redesign plans. They relate to the introduction of 16 core bus corridors, with continuous segregated bus and cycle lanes. It’s confusing because both projects are part of the overall BusConnects strategy.So are these now the final plans for the redesign?The NTA will hold a final round of public consultation until December 3rd before finalising the plan which will be implemented in 2021 and 2023."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4052689.1571236523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"is it difficult to secure a college place in ireland from abroad","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents from other jurisdictions can apply for college courses in Ireland  through the CAO system. Photograph: iStockOur family has been based abroad for several years, but my daughter is keen to go to college in Ireland. She is sitting the US college-based AP program this year. Can you advise how this translates in to applying to the Irish university system? In Ireland we have a Central Application Operations (CAO) system through which potential students nominate their college courses of choice.Following the opening of the college application process on 5th November next, your daughter should register with the CAO (cao.ie) and submit her application.Over the coming months she should research all the courses offered through the Irish third level system. Qualifax (qualifax.ie) is a good start. The site is easy to navigate and she should be able identify programmes that meet her needs, both in terms of content and progression opportunities. I would advise her to study every programme in some depth to ensure she is familiar with all aspects of its delivery.She can complete her initial list of course choices on her CAO online application by 1st February next. She will have an opportunity to amend those choices up to 1st July next during the months of May and June next.When her application is being considered by each college, she will be offered the highest course on each of the two lists for which heshe secures the necessary grades in whichever terminal exam she completes.As your daughter is taking the US college-based AP programme, she should tick the ‘other school leaving exams’ box in the qualifications \u0026amp assessments summary section of the online application form. She must then provide details of her school leaving exams and the years they were completed. Make sure she describes the examinations briefly and submit certified A4 photocopies of any certificates, with translations if the certificate is not in English, to CAO, Tower House, Eglinton Street, Galway, Ireland.If she is sitting their examinations in 2020, she must submit certified photocopies of their results to CAO as soon as they become available.If she has any queries about how her application will be assessed, she must contact the admissions office of any college for which she has listed a course. There is no uniformity in how Irish third level institutions treat applications from other jurisdictions and nationalities.In the case of some colleges, they may require the applicant to submit applications directly to the admissions office of the institution in question as well as or instead of to the CAO. Therefore, it is vitally important that your daughter not only identifies each course for which she wishes to be considered, but also checks with that colleges admissions office that she fulfils all their application requirement for her unique circumstances."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059256.1571759017!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"humiliation disrespect deceit taoiseach apologises for cervicalcheck controversy","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar delivers a State apology in the Dáil to the women and their families impacted by the cervical smear test controversy. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan pictured arriving at Leinster House. Photograph: Tom Honan Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has delivered a State apology in the Dáil to the women and their families impacted by the cervical smear test controversy.Controversy over the screening programme was sparked by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who has cervical cancer, settling a High Court action in April over the reading of her smear test. Ms Phelan and fellow campaigners Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh were among about 150 people who attended the Dáil to hear the apology.Mr Varadkar said the women and their families had suffered “from a litany of failures” in the operation of the CervicalCheck screening programme.“We vow now to make sure it never happens to someone again,” he said.In his statement to the Dáil, the Taoiseach said “we say sorry to those whose lives were shattered, those whose lives were destroyed, and those whose lives could have been different”.Mr Varadkar said they knew cancer screening programmes could not detect all cancers. “We also know that many failures have taken place.”He also apologised for the failure to tell the whole truth and to do so in a timely manner.“We are sorry for failures of clinical governance failures of leadership and management failure to tell the whole truth and do so in a timely manner the humiliation, disrespect and deceit the false reassurance the attempts to play down the seriousness of this debacle.”Mr Varadkar said “we apologise to those who survived and still bear the scars, both physically and mentally. As do their families.“We apologise to those who are here in our presence. To those watching from home who have kept it to themselves. We apologise to those passed on and who cannot be here.”The Taoiseach acknowledged that “today’s apology is too late for some who were affected. For others it will never be enough”.He said it was a “broken service, broken promises, broken lives -a debacle that left a country heartbroken. A system that was doomed to fail. We apologise: to our wives, our daughters, our sisters, our mothers.“To the men who lost the centre of their lives and who every day have to try and pick up the pieces. The single fathers and grandparents. To the children who will always have a gaping hole in their lives.“To all those grieving for what has been taken from them. The happy days that will never be.”He added that “a State apology may not provide closure, but I hope it will help to heal”.Mr Varadkar said “a State apology will not repair all that has been broken, nor restore all that has been lost, but we can make it count for something. “He said the recommendations in the three reports on the controversy by Dr Gabriel Scally will all be implemented.He said that “now, in the words of Vicky Phelan, I want something good to come out of all of this”, and he also paid tribute to Mr Teap and Ms Walsh, whose actions had enhanced the response, he said.“Speaking as a doctor, as well as a politician, a brother and a son, I know the lessons we must learn.”He added that “we need a better culture in our health service, one that treats patients with respect and always tells the truth. One that is never paternalistic - doctor doesn’t always know best.“We must always share full information with our patients, admit mistakes, and put the person first.”Mr Varadkar acknowledged “we have seen further errors in some of the laboratories since the publication of the Scally Report, causing confusion and anxiety, so we have more to do to restore confidence. We are determined to do so.”But People Before Profit TD Brid Smith said this apology would sit better if the State ceased the challenge to the case made by terminally ill woman Ruth Morrissey and to re-open the audit for other women.Ms Smith said she supported the programme but “will not take lectures or mansplaining from Ministers or officials” about the system.And she condemned the outsourcing of tests to other countries and demanded they should be repatriated, a call which was echoed by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald who warned some of the lessons of the controversy had still not been learned. She said words “are hollow without the actions to back them up” including repatriation of screening.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said he strongly supported the State apology. He said it took a “very brave and determined woman” to go to the High Court before the scandal was acknowledged and a series of reports before the full details were revealed.He pointed out “this service has saved thousands of lives” but every patient who uses it “has the right to know that everything possible has been done to reduce potential error” and that they would be quickly and fully informed when such errors occurred.Ms McDonald and she said the screening service should be repatriated to Ireland and not outsourced to other countries.Labour health spokesman Alan Kelly said the apology was “ the beginning of a healing process and finally we have a proper, informed official acknowledgements of the wrongdoings”.He said that through this process people had learned to question health professionals in a way that did not happen in the past.Earlier, Dr Gabriel Scally, the public health doctor who led an inquiry into the debacle, said a State apology by Mr Varadkar to women and their families impacted by the cervical smear test scandal would be very important. “I think this is quite a momentous step and quite unprecedented,” said Dr Scally.“The three things that really matter to people when things really go wrong badly in the medical system are for someone to tell them the truth, what went wrong, why it went wrong secondly to say sorry and to really mean that, and from someone with some skin in the game and the third is to say how it is going to be avoided in the future.”Dr Scally said his report last year into the affair exposed a “complete failure from top to bottom in terms of the cervical screening programme” and how women and relatives were treated “appallingly badly”.His recommendations on changing the system are being implemented, he said.“The thing that has been missing in the middle is someone actually saying we are very sorry, apologising, and really meaning it for what went wrong and the trauma that these women and their families were subjected to,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“I think that is what is going to happen today. I think the Taoiseach as a doctor will feel this very, very deeply, and as a former minster for health, he will understand exactly what went wrong and why it went wrong”.Dr Scally added: “It is has been a very disturbing episode in health care and it is right and proper that the Taoiseach is making the apology on behalf of the State, for something that really didn’t go very well at all.”Dr Scally added that he was satisfied with how his recommendations were being implemented by the Health Service Executive, although he said there is “plenty more to do” and some of the changes will take time to “work their way through the system”.The Taoiseach pledged last summer to make an apology after he met members of the 221-plus support group, which represents women and families affected.Government sources confirmed Mr Varadkar was due to issue the apology early this week, but declined to comment further.However, he is expected to say the State should have informed women that they had been given incorrect all-clear test results before they were diagnosed with cancer.Mr Varadkar is also expected to accept the findings of independent reports into the controversy, which found that tests were being outsourced to more laboratories than was previously known.More than 221 women were affected by the CervicalCheck controversy. The women involved had developed cervical cancer, after which an audit of their earlier tests was carried out. This audit revealed “discordant” results but most of the women were not told of them.In some cases, their treatment might have been different if a different interpretation had been placed on their slides."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Defence counsel made submissions in trial of Liam Brannigan (37) over murder of Gary HanleyDoctor says abortion services not deregulated and abortions up to 28 weeks not allowedEverything you need to know about the proposed Dublin bus network revampWarning issued to protect customer health following issues at Leixlip treatment plantAoife Bennett claims she developed narcolepsy after she got Pandemrix swine flu injectionFootpaths and pavements throughout Ireland in need of urgent repair, says groupPatient support group welcomes apology, describing it as a \u0026lsquowatershed moment\u0026rsquoSipo agreed to withdraw referral of case to GardaGarda\u0026iacute awaiting DPP\u0026rsquos directions on fatal hit-and-run in Cork93 per cent of DNA found on glove fingertip matched Marlowe\u0026rsquos DNA profile \u0026ndash courtLeo Varadkar\u0026rsquos signal dampens intense speculation of imminent general electionWoman was not told about 2014 review of slide by her colposcopist until 2018Taoiseach insists progress being made amid claims of further spiralling costsIrish protest group acknowledges London tube protest should not have happenedVicky Phelan hears State apology delivered in D\u0026aacuteil to women and families affectedVictim \u0026lsquopanicked and screaming\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquopeople were hiding behind cars\u0026rsquo, says witnessCarlow couple sued for \u0026euro300,000 over allegations they caused a collisionStrategic housing development system \u0026lsquoan affront on democracy\u0026rsquo, committee told"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059480.1571771831!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boil water notice for dublin kildare and meath to affect 600 000 people","story":"A boil water notice was issued by Irish Water on Tuesday evening affecting more than half a million people in parts of Dublin, Co Kildare and Co Meath.Roughly 600,000 live in the areas of Fingal, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council parts of Kildare and in Dunboyne, Co Meath which are affected by the notice.The warning follows issues with a water treatment plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, which may have compromised the disinfection process which makes the water safe to drink.Irish Water said the notice was issued to protect the health of customers on a precautionary measure and came into immediate effect.It said the issues have now been resolved, but affected water is still travelling through the system.A spokeswoman was unable to say when the notice is likely to be lifted, but that updates will be available on its website and on social media. The spokeswoman added that Irish Water will be continually testing the the supply and liaising with the HSE throughout the process. Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.Irish Water’s website had crashed on Tuesday evening, shortly after the company issued the notice. An interactive map of the areas affected has been posted online.Boil waterIrish Water has advised that water must be boiled for drinking drinks made with water preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating brushing of teeth and making ice cubes.The company acknowledged the impact and inconvenience caused by the notice to homes and businesses.“We would like to reassure our customers that Irish Water’s drinking water and operational experts are working with our colleagues in Fingal County Council to resolve this issue as quickly as possible,” the company said, in a statement.“Irish Water is contacting all registered vulnerable customers who are affected by this boil water notice to advise them.”It has asked anyone with queries to contact Irish Water directly on its customer care helpline (1850 278 278) and or check its website (water.ie) for updates.The company has advised that water can be used for personal hygiene, bathing and flushing of toilets but not for brushing teeth or gargling.It says users should boil water by bringing to a vigorous, rolling boil and allow to cool. This water should be covered and stored in a refrigerator or cold place. Domestic water filters will not render water safe to drink, it says.Bottled waterIt adds that caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure that they do not swallow the bathing water.For the preparation of infant feeds with water, it advises the use of water that has been brought to the boil once and cooled. Water that has been re-boiled several times should not be used.It has advised caution if using bottled water for preparing baby food as some natural mineral water may have high sodium content. The legal limit for sodium in drinking water is 200mg per litre."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

File photograph: The What’s the story with Dáil electronic voting?TDs vote by electronic means and press a Tá (for Yes) or Nil (for No) with the appropriate green or red button on the bench in front of them. There is also a blue button for Staon (Abstain).Each member has a designated seat from which they vote and a large screen at the front of the chamber, which is also shown on TV monitors, displays each red green and blue vote as a dot.The electronic system is used for the majority of votes but not when a government and ministers are being voted on. This requires TDs to walk through the voting lobbies.A walk-through vote takes about 20 minutes while the first electronic vote of a sitting takes 12 minutes, allowing time for TDs to get to the chamber, with subsequent votes quicker.Every Thursday at lunchtime there is a block voting session when TDs vote on private members’ motions and on legislation.What happened on Thursday with Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley?Eight votes were taken on Thursday: three on a Green Party motion about afforestation four on a Sinn Féin motion about the living wage and one on a Fianna Fáil motion about electric scooters. Mr Dooley was absent for all eight votes but was registered as having voted six times. The Oireachtas video shows him in the chamber just before the voting commenced, talking to an official and then to party colleague Niall Collins before leaving.What did he say happened?When asked about the issue by the Irish Independent on Friday, Mr Dooley replied “there must have been a mistake or something” and “I don’t know anything about it”. On Saturday he told The  that he “left the chamber to take a phone call. I was made aware yesterday that my vote was recorded . . . I understand from Niall Collins, that under the mistaken belief that I was at the back of the chamber on the phone, he pressed my voting button.”Mr Dooley said he spoke to the Ceann Comhairle to explain and apologise.What did Mr Collins say?He confirmed he voted for Mr Dooley on six occasions last Thursday and that he did so without being asked.“I thought he was up the back of the chamber, in the lobby, on the phone up there. But when I checked it with him he had actually exited the chamber.”Mr Collins said he was not asked by Mr Dooley to vote for him.Are TDs allowed to vote for each other?TDs vote for each other if they have moved from their assigned seat to speak to another member and will ask a colleague to press the button on their bench. Sometimes TDs go to the back of the chamber to take a phone call and will ask someone in their row to press the button. The protocols for voting are set out in the handbook that each new TD receives when elected to the Dáil.What happens nowThe Ceann Comhairle has asked the clerk of the Dáil to prepare a report on the conduct of the votes. The final sanction will be determined on the outcome of the report by the Ceann Comhairle but Mr Dooley and Mr Collins have been asked by\u0026nbspparty leader Micheál Martin to step down from the Fianna Fáil front bench without prejudice.Are expenses contingent on being present for votes?No. TDs are required to sign in daily and do so electronically by pressing a fob against any of several devices on walls at various locations around Leinster House. A daily allowance is paid for attendance.\u0026nbspDo TDs often vote for each other when someone is absent from the House?Mr Martin said that the practice is not commonplace. Public Accounts Committee chairman Seán Fleming, a Fianna Fáil TD, said he had “never seen it happen”. He said TDs from all parties can see on the screen how everyone is voting and who is absent.What can be done to prevent it happening again?Labour leader Brendan Howlin said that in the European Parliament MEPs have to insert an identity card before they can vote electronically at their assigned seat. This option was considered but dismissed for the Dáil on the grounds that TDs might lose their ID cards. It may be that in future TDs will have to remain in their assigned seat for the duration of the voting bloc and be permitted to press only their own button."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059192.1571768060!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il voting rules to be tightened as votegate controversy deepens","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCeann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said electronic votes ‘shall only be taken when all members are seated in their designated seat’Voting rules in the Dáil are to be tightened pending the outcome of investigations into the “votegate” controversy, Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl has declared.“Let no person be in any doubt that this is a very serious situation, which requires urgent action. I am absolutely committed to establish the facts and making any changes that are deemed necessary following the review,” he said.Pending a report on the controversy surrounding Fianna Fáil TDs Niall Collins and Timmy Dooley and, to a lesser extent, others, electronic votes “shall only be taken when all members are seated in their designated seat”, he said.Each whip “will certify the members who voted in his or her party or group”, and this will be given to the tellers before the result is formally declared, the Ceann Comhairle went on.He also told the House that a separate complaint had been made under the Ethics in Public Office Act. “This statutory process must take its course,” Mr Ó Fearghaíl said.Six timesMr Ó Fearghaíl’s comments came amid the growing controversy over the voting system after it emerged Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins voted for his colleague Timmy Dooley six times during the voting block last Thursday.Amid calls from the Government side, including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, that the two TDs should make statements to the Dáil and answer questions during a debate on Thursday, the Ceann Comhairle reminded TDs that, under the Constitution, the only questions that could be put in the House are questions to member of Government.“There is no structure where we can interrogate inidual deputies,” he said.Mr Varadkar later told Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who raised the issue, that if a voter voted twice in an election, “that would be a crime.”However, he said “there is a world of a difference in being present but not in your seat” and voting for someone who is absent.Ms McDonald asked if it was an isolated incident or was there some implicit or explicit pattern at play among some TDs .The Taoiseach said he could not speak for Fianna Fáil or any TD, but “we should allow those investigations to take place”.He added that “people need to know that the system is robust and valid” and that “there will be a report”.‘Integrity’The Ceann Comhairle said: “These revelations are very grave and go to the heart of the credibility of our parliamentary process.“The integrity of the voting system is of the utmost importance,” and the public must have trust in the system.He had directed the clerk of the Dáil to prepare an urgent report to establish the facts of what transpired.“Work is well under way,” he said. The clerk had been requested to speak to a number of members, to tellers and to the party and group whips.The Committee on Procedure would consider any recommendation that may be required on the electronic voting system, he added.“The electronic voting system is integral to to our parliamentary voting system and has been since 2001.” He said “any recommendations will be given immediate attention”.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin welcomed the Ceann Comhairle’s remarks and inquiry.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said it was an issue of the utmost importance."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059023.1571764230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eight clear instances of ministers not in seats for votes fianna f%C3%A1il trawl finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TDs Niall Collins and Timmy Dooley are being investigated over a series of votes last week. Photograph: PAA review of Dáil footage from the last 12 months found “serious issues with the voting system with systematic voting in place of other members,” according to an email from the Fianna Fáil whips office.“This brief review focused on those TDs who should be visible in their seats in the main Dáil Éireann TV feed. It highlights eight clear instances where Ministers may have been absent from the chamber or have got somebody else to vote for them.”Five ministers are named, including the Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, the Minister of State in the Department of Housing Damien English, the Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty, the Minister of State for Older People Jim Daly and the Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring.The issue has been referred on to the Dáil’s Committee on Procedures, a source said.Separately, it is understood that Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin told a private meeting of frontbenchers on Tuesday that he was “disappointed” following the recent revelations about senior TDs in his party voting for absent members.“He basically said it was sloppy and we need to sharpen up,” said a source.The Dáil ethics committee is also due to consider a complaint from Fine Gael TD Noel Rock about the six votes cast by senior Fianna Fáil TD Niall Collins for his absent colleague Timmy Dooley. This complaint will likely be referred by the clerk of the Dáil to the committee in the coming hours.A complaint under the Ethics in Public Office Act has been made about two Fianna Fáil TDs at the centre of the controversy over absent voting.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl told the Dáil that Limerick Deputy Niall Collins and his Clare colleague Timmy Dooley are the subject of a complaint to the committee on members’ interests in the Dáil. The two senior TDs stood down from the party’s frontbench at the request of Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, pending the outcome of the investigation.Mr O Fearghaíl told the Dáil on Tuesday he would convene a meeting of the Dáil Committee on Procedure at 4pm to brief them on the progress of an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding last Thursday’s events, where Mr Collins voted on Mr Dooley’s behalf on five occasions while the latter was absent from the Chamber. The report is being prepared by Dáil Clerk, Peter Finnegan, and will be completed by Thursday morning, at which time the Committee will convene again to consider its findings. In a statement, the Ceann Comhairle said no one should be in any doubt it was a very serious situation which required urgent action. “I am absolutely committed to establishing the facts and making any changes to the electronic voting system that are deemed necessary following the review,” he said. He also told TDs that from this week votes would only be accepted from members of the Dáil who were sitting in their designated seats. “I have directed that each Whip certifies the Members who voted from his or her party or group and this certification will be given to the teller (the member of each party who counts and coordinates the vote tally).”This is in response to the widespread practice in the Dáil where TDs who are elsewhere in the Chamber ask colleagues to press the button on their voting pad. Meanwhile, Fine Gael has criticised Fianna Fáil for trying to muddy the waters by highlighting video footage where Fine Gael Ministers were not in their seats for Dáil votes.So far, the party has released details of five different sittings where Fine Gael Ministers were not in their seats. The Fine Gael spokesman said: “Rather than respond to issues of genuine public interest, such as the interview in which a Fianna Fáil front bench spokesperson told national radio she had not cast a vote for an absent colleague when in fact she had, Fianna Fáil continues to try and muddy the waters and distract from the failure to answer the questions. “They’ve spent the last few days trying to secure video footage similar to what Deputies Timmy Dooley, Niall Collins and Lisa Chambers engaged in as opposed to answering questions about what occurred during Dáil voting last Thursday,” added the spokesman. On Monday Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said he has written to the Ceann Comhairle over what he has described as the “illegal act” of a Fianna Fáil frontbencher voting for a colleague absent from the Dáil.Mr Flanagan declined to apologise for having voted for other colleagues himself while in the chamber.The controversy broadened last night as TDs from across the political spectrum admitted to voting for colleagues who were present in the Dáil chamber but who were not in their designated seats."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059429.1571770923!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach intends to call four byelections for november 29th","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar said it it the intention to hold the byelections by the end of November.

But there is one thing that their pitch has in common: exam results.And a question often at the forefront of parents’ minds is:  Will it be worth it?With fees rising year on year, how do you know if a school is good value for money? Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next week we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellersby College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellersby College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

There was no immediate comment from Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on the deal.But if the agreement holds it means Turkey will not restart its military offensive, which many feared would resume as soon as an earlier ceasefire ended at 10pm on Tuesday.  According to this agreement, Turkey and Russia will not allow any separatist agenda on Syrian territory, Mr Erdoğan said.Turkey and Syria borderThe talks in Sochi underscore how quickly Russia has replaced the US as the main powerbroker in northeast Syria in the days since Donald Trump, the US president, pulled American forces out of the region.Russian forces will now stand guard in areas that only a few weeks were ago were being patrolled by US troops. The evening agreement between Russia and Turkey capped a dramatic day as the world counted down the hours until the end of the ceasefire brokered last week by US vice president Mike Pence.The US said earlier in the day that it believed that Kurdish forces had fulfilled their obligations to withdraw from a key 120km stretch of the border and warned Turkey that it would impose sanctions if the Turkish military resumed attacks. Areas of Rojava and Iraqi Kurdistan before the Turkish offensiveThe Russian-Turkish deal appears to expand on the earlier American agreement and ensure that Kurdish forces will leave the entire length of the border.Turkey will maintain control in areas it has already seized while Russian and Syrian regime forces will hold the rest of the border.The agreement also states that the Kurds will withdraw from two holdout towns in western Syria, Kobani and Tel Rifaat, which Turkey has been trying to dislodge them from them for more than a year.     Sergey Shoygu, the Russian defence minister, said up to 500 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) members had escaped from Kurdish-run prisons in northeast Syria amid the chaos of the Turkish offensive. US troops are withdrawing from northeast SyriaMeanwhile, confusion over the US plan to withdraw forces from Syria deepened on Tuesday after Iraq’s government said the retreating troops did not have permission to stay in Iraq.“There is no permission granted for these forces to stay inside Iraq,” the Iraqi military said.The comment appeared to contradict claims by the Pentagon that the roughly 1,000 soldiers would stay in Iraq to continue fighting Isil.  Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, said he would try to smooth the issue during a visit to Iraq and added that the additional American forces did not plan “to stay in Iraq interminably”.There was a bleak reminder of the threat from Isil inside Iraq when it emerged Tuesday that a senior Iraqi police commander had been killed in an ambush by jihadist fighters. Bashar al-Assad visited his forces in Idlib for the first time in yearsBashar al-Assad made a rare trip outside Damascus to visit his troops on the front line in southern Idlib, where Syrian regime forces are battling against jihadists and rebels to take back the last opposition-held province in Syria.  The visit is the first time Assad has stepped foot in the province in years and marks his growing confidence after several weeks of good news for Damascus. While his forces are make slow progress in Idlib, they were handed an unexpected victory in northeast Syria after Kurdish forces invited them in to confront Turkey.  Assad took aim at the Turkish president during the trip to Idlib, saying: “Erdogan is a thief and is now stealing our land.” He vowed to continue his assault on Idlib, which is home to around 3 million civilians, and said a victory in the provice would help “decisively end chaos and terrorism in all of Syria”.  Prosecutors reconsider prosecuting members of Isil \u0026#39Beatles\u0026#39 gang in the UKBrexit vote result: Boris Johnson decisively wins vote on Withdrawal Agreement Bill but loses key vote on Brexit timetable -

The number of electric vehicles on the roads in the city increased after the scheme was implemented.Launching a\u0026nbspconsultation on\u0026nbspthe new plans on Tuesday, transport secretary Grant

needed to slash emissions from transport.Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates said:\u0026nbsp“Green number plates may encourage some people to choose cleaner cars, but if ministers really want to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.“A national\u0026nbspscrappage\u0026nbspscheme is urgently needed too, to help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative – such as car club membership, a rail season ticket or even an e-bike loan.”Friends of the Earth said the only real solution to the problem is to cut traffic levels by ending the government’s multi-billion-pound road-building programme and investing instead in\u0026nbspaffordable and efficient public transport, and safer cycling and walking facilities.The DfT hopes more people will consider buying cleaner cars when they see the plates which have three potential designs: a\u0026nbspfully green plate with black letters, a yellow plate with a green bar on one side, or a yellow plate with a green dot or symbol.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only a fifth think it’s a good idea and the majority said the number plates wouldn’t have the effect of making them any more likely to switch to an electric vehicle.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ethnic minority workers also tend to have higher qualifications than their white counterparts.The findings, laid out in a speech by Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane on Monday, reveal a wider ethnicity pay gap than raw statistics suggest. It is also a “strikingly” persistent gap, having narrowed less over the past quarter-century than the pay disparity between genders. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem,” Mr Haldane said.Minority academics less likely to become professors than whitesOne in four BAME workers experience bullying and harassmentHe went on to argue for compulsory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, drawing a parallel with the existing obligation on UK companies with 250 employees or more to reveal their gender pay gap. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe adjusted data also points to large variations between different ethnic groups. While mixed race workers earn 2 per cent more than their white peers, all other ethnic minorities earn less, ranging from 20 per cent less for people of Bangladeshi origin to 6 per cent less for workers of a Chinese background.The analysis emphasises the importance of looking at each group separately, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single cohort, Mr Haldane said.While adjusting the raw data for the various characteristics helps explain a large part of the pay gap, it does not mean that part of the gap is justified, he noted.“In other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is almost a fifth higher than the offer from Amsterdam-based Takeaway.Still, the board of Just Eat rejected the overture from Prosus as it “significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects”,\u0026nbspand recommended that shareholders do the same.Just Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management’s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.In its statement, aimed at Just Eat shareholders, Prosus said it believes the business will require substantial investment, over and above that planned by the company’s management.Amazon investment in Deliveroo halted as watchdog launches probeJust Eat announces £9bn merger with TakeawayJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on app“Just Eat’s third-quarter trading update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage,”\u0026nbspit said.“Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway will fully or effectively address this investment need.”Just Eat and Takeaway face tough competition from rivals with deep pockets such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.The bid from Prosus follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Earlier this year, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of\u0026nbspPeppa\u0026nbspPig, while Britain’s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to\u0026nbspCKA, a Hong Kong real estate group. Meanwhile, Fuller’s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan’s largest brewer.Just Eat’s shares surged 20 per cent shortly after Prosus announced its offer and traded about\u0026nbsp25 per cent higher on the day in the afternoon.He added that a merger or a takeover of sufficient scale would create a company with the heft to take on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Amazon.Prosus already has other investments in the food-delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Berlin-based Delivery Hero and Swiggy in India.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

generation from renewable sources is set to jump 50 per cent over the next five years, helped by a sharp increase in the number of solar panels on buildings, according to a report.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts an extra 1,200 gigawatts of\u0026nbsprenewable energy will be added globally by 2024 – equivalent to the current total power-generating capacity of the United States.However, the agency\u0026nbspwarned that the expansion remains well below what is needed to meet global sustainable energy targets.\u0026nbspThe report predicts that cost reductions and “concerted government efforts” will drive the increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which will account for 60 per cent of additional renewable capacity.“Renewables are already the world’s second-largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director.“As costs continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar PV.”Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created

rather than in large-scale, purpose-built sites.This will account for half of additional solar capacity created in the next five years, the IEA said.Three-quarters of new distributed PV is to come from installations on industrial buildings, in part because economies of scale allow for bigger savings on electricity bills than homeowners can expect when they instal a small number of solar panels.The cost of generating electricity from distributed solar PV systems is already below retail electricity prices in most countries, and the IEA forecasts a further 15 per cent to 35 per cent drop by 2024.However, the report’s authors warned policymakers that retail electricity tariffs must be reformed to attract more investment in distributed PV while sharing costs fairly among consumers. \u0026nbsp“Distributed PV’s potential is breathtaking, but its development needs to be well-managed to balance the different interests of PV system owners, other consumers and energy and distribution

The measure for export prospects came in at -46, the lowest since October 2001.“Brexit concerns have clearly driven concern about the near-term outlook for exports, with citations of political and economic uncertainty abroad and quotaimport licence restrictions spiking to multi-decade highs,” the CBI said.Investment intentions also worsened, with planned spending on buildings, plants and machinery, and training and retraining posting the sharpest drops since early to mid-2009, when Britain was still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis.\u0026nbspLikewise, manufacturers expect their output to fall in the next three months at the fastest pace since early 2009, compounding the\u0026nbspdecline between August and October.Hazy trade outlook and jumpy pound seen as top barriers to UK exportsNo-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 impact on car industryUK manufacturing shrinks for fifth month in a row amid Brexit turmoilHeadcount in the sector fell at its fastest since April 2010, with firms anticipating an even sharper decline in the next three months.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the global economic downturn also played a part and noted that the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the government announced a new Brexit deal.But he added: “With the accompanying political declaration laying out a harder former of Brexit than previously envisaged, with a clear commitment to take Britain out of the customs union, we doubt that manufacturers have become more optimistic since the new deal was struck. The downturn in the manufacturing sector, therefore, looks like it has plenty further left to run.”Boding ill for future output, the survey’s measure for manufacturers’ total order books was at its lowest since January 2010 and worse than expected by economists.Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Finding a resolution that avoids a no-deal Brexit will give firms the confidence they need to step up investment in people, growth and innovation.“But for long-lasting prosperity we need an ambitious free trade agreement which provides tariff-free access to our largest trading partner for our manufacturers right across the country.”Another survey showed earlier this month that uncertainties around Brexit and future tariffs, as well as the volatile pound are holding back British exports.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe CBI interviewed 258 firms between 25 September and 14 October.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The number of electric vehicles on the roads in the city increased after the scheme was implemented.Launching a\u0026nbspconsultation on\u0026nbspthe new plans on Tuesday, transport secretary Grant Shapps said: “Green number plates are a really positive and exciting way to help everyone recognise the increasing number of electric vehicles on our roads.“By increasing awareness of these vehicles and the benefits they bring to their drivers and our environment, we will turbo-charge the zero-emission revolution.”Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with

needed to slash emissions from transport.Friends of the Earth campaigner Jenny Bates said:\u0026nbsp“Green number plates may encourage some people to choose cleaner cars, but if ministers really want to boost the take-up of electric vehicles they should introduce more charging points and better financial incentives.“A national\u0026nbspscrappage\u0026nbspscheme is urgently needed too, to help fund a switch to a cleaner vehicle or greener transport alternative – such as car club membership, a rail season ticket or even an e-bike loan.”Friends of the Earth said the only real solution to the problem is to cut traffic levels by ending the government’s multi-billion-pound road-building programme and investing instead in\u0026nbspaffordable and efficient public transport, and safer cycling and walking facilities.The DfT hopes more people will consider buying cleaner cars when they see the plates which have three potential designs: a\u0026nbspfully green plate with black letters, a yellow plate with a green bar on one side, or a yellow plate with a green dot or symbol.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only a fifth think it’s a good idea and the majority said the number plates wouldn’t have the effect of making them any more likely to switch to an electric vehicle.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ethnic minority workers also tend to have higher qualifications than their white counterparts.The findings, laid out in a speech by Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane on Monday, reveal a wider ethnicity pay gap than raw statistics suggest. It is also a “strikingly” persistent gap, having narrowed less over the past quarter-century than the pay disparity between genders. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“The ethnicity pay gap problem in the UK is every bit as acute as the gender pay gap problem,” Mr Haldane said.Minority academics less likely to become professors than whitesOne in four BAME workers experience bullying and harassmentHe went on to argue for compulsory reporting of ethnicity pay gaps, drawing a parallel with the existing obligation on UK companies with 250 employees or more to reveal their gender pay gap. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe adjusted data also points to large variations between different ethnic groups. While mixed race workers earn 2 per cent more than their white peers, all other ethnic minorities earn less, ranging from 20 per cent less for people of Bangladeshi origin to 6 per cent less for workers of a Chinese background.The analysis emphasises the importance of looking at each group separately, rather than necessarily treating ethnic minorities as a single cohort, Mr Haldane said.While adjusting the raw data for the various characteristics helps explain a large part of the pay gap, it does not mean that part of the gap is justified, he noted.“In other cases the choice of an occupation or sector may be a personal decision, reflecting lifestyle and values, and less obviously a market failure or policy concern.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is almost a fifth higher than the offer from Amsterdam-based Takeaway.Still, the board of Just Eat rejected the overture from Prosus as it “significantly undervalues Just Eat and its attractive assets and prospects”,\u0026nbspand recommended that shareholders do the same.Just Eat is the largest food delivery company in the UK but analysts have criticised its management’s failure to capitalise on its early dominance of the rapidly growing sector, allowing nimbler rivals like Deliveroo to gain ground.In its statement, aimed at Just Eat shareholders, Prosus said it believes the business will require substantial investment, over and above that planned by the company’s management.Amazon investment in Deliveroo halted as watchdog launches probeJust Eat announces £9bn merger with TakeawayJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on app“Just Eat’s third-quarter trading update demonstrated a significant slowdown in order growth, which highlights the need to accelerate this investment to sustain its competitive advantage,”\u0026nbspit said.“Prosus does not believe that the proposed combination with Takeaway will fully or effectively address this investment need.”Just Eat and Takeaway face tough competition from rivals with deep pockets such as Uber Eats and Deliveroo, which is backed by Amazon.The bid from Prosus follows a string of foreign acquisitions of British companies. Earlier this year, US toymaker Hasbro bought the UK-listed owner of\u0026nbspPeppa\u0026nbspPig, while Britain’s biggest pub owner Greene King agreed to sell its entire business to\u0026nbspCKA, a Hong Kong real estate group. Meanwhile, Fuller’s, another UK pub group, sold its brewing business to Asahi, Japan’s largest brewer.Just Eat’s shares surged 20 per cent shortly after Prosus announced its offer and traded about\u0026nbsp25 per cent higher on the day in the afternoon.He added that a merger or a takeover of sufficient scale would create a company with the heft to take on Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Amazon.Prosus already has other investments in the food-delivery sector, including iFood in Latin America, Berlin-based Delivery Hero and Swiggy in India.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s not valid,” Scorsese said. “I can’t…”He continued, “That goes back to 1970. That’s a question that I’ve had for so many years. Am I supposed to? If the story doesn’t call for it, then it’s a waste of everybody’s time. If the story calls for a female character lead, why not?”Emma Tillinger Koskoff, a producer on The Irishman who was at the press conference, also refuted the claim, suggesting the 1974 film Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore as an example of a Scorsese film with a female lead.Created with Sketch.25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma\u0027s preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie – and David Lynch’s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director\u0027s adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It\u0027s the only one of Lynch\u0027s films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year’s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better.  326 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990)Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000.

The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production\u0027s many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon\u0027s follow-up book, The Devil\u0027s Candy.1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow\u0027s beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character\u0027s narration – a huge reason behind the novel\u0027s success.The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as “a perfect work of the American imagination, the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joffé strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne\u0027s pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama.  To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard’s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in “Worst Movies Ever” infamy, effectively ending Travolta’s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper’s before it even started.  Louis de Bernières\u0027s Captain Corelli\u0027s Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version – from the same British company that made Notting Hill – lost all traces of the novel\u0027s heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Penélope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake.  The beauty of HG Wells’s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells\u0027s great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce\u0027s lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story.There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film\u0027s late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful.Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan’s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig’s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed – the man who becomes obsessed with him – are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it.Nick Hornby adaptations don’t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby’s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a \u0027girlfriend’ role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby’s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing.The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels \u0026amp Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn\u0027t have existed had this one not been so successful.20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation – one where all of the source materials\u0027 sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen.1426 Running with Scissors (2006)Augusten Burroughs’s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy’s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It’s no wonder this sunk without a trace. In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman’s superb His Dark Materials trilogy – or rather, the first book Northern Lights – was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007\u0027s The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising.Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger’s The Time Traveller\u0027s Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there\u0027s nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it\u0027s meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell\u0027s sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it\u0027s an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it.Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson – but that’s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book\u0027s material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three.  The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn\u0027t help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent.No adaptation of The Great Gatsby,  F Scott Fitzgerald’s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann\u0027s 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio’s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald’s delicate story-telling.Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein’s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games  and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgård and Katie Holmes) very little to do.  John Niven\u0027s Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can\u0027t be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows – the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox.2326 The Girl on the Train (2016)Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn’s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance – and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn\u0027t help, either. Clarke\u0027s performance as the paid companion to Claflin’s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated.  While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King\u0027s finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared – but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel\u0027s 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u0027s On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in –\u0026nbspthe Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007).“Oh, that’s only one film. They don’t count that,” Scorsese replied. “Age of Innocence – they don’t count that. Casino – Sharon Stone’s great in that. They don’t count that. Forget it. It’s all these men.”The Age of Innocence, released in 1993, featured starring roles for Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. 1995’s Casino secured Stone an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.Asked if he would like to write more female characters, Scorsese said he would.Martin Scorsese reveals what Goodfellas scene audiences hatedScorsese says use of CGI in his new film ‘an evolution of make-up’Robert De Niro recreated classic Goodfellas scene for The Irishman“But you know what, I’m 76 now.

generation from renewable sources is set to jump 50 per cent over the next five years, helped by a sharp increase in the number of solar panels on buildings, according to a report.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts an extra 1,200 gigawatts of\u0026nbsprenewable energy will be added globally by 2024 – equivalent to the current total power-generating capacity of the United States.However, the agency\u0026nbspwarned that the expansion remains well below what is needed to meet global sustainable energy targets.\u0026nbspThe report predicts that cost reductions and “concerted government efforts” will drive the increase in solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, which will account for 60 per cent of additional renewable capacity.“Renewables are already the world’s second-largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,” said Dr Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director.“As costs continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar PV.”Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created

rather than in large-scale, purpose-built sites.This will account for half of additional solar capacity created in the next five years, the IEA said.Three-quarters of new distributed PV is to come from installations on industrial buildings, in part because economies of scale allow for bigger savings on electricity bills than homeowners can expect when they instal a small number of solar panels.The cost of generating electricity from distributed solar PV systems is already below retail electricity prices in most countries, and the IEA forecasts a further 15 per cent to 35 per cent drop by 2024.However, the report’s authors warned policymakers that retail electricity tariffs must be reformed to attract more investment in distributed PV while sharing costs fairly among consumers. \u0026nbsp“Distributed PV’s potential is breathtaking, but its development needs to be well-managed to balance the different interests of PV system owners, other consumers and energy and distribution companies,” Dr Birol said.\u0026nbsp“The IEA is ready to advise governments on what is needed to take full advantage of this rapidly emerging technology without jeopardising electricity security.”Only

Three fans fell unconscious during the show.The researchers said it was difficult to describe how loud the bellbird’s call was because it is\u0026nbsphard to compare sounds from different distances. But the calls are so noisy that scientists are intrigued about how white bellbird females listen at close range without damaging their hearing.Biologist Jeff Podos at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who studied the bellbirds alongside Mario Cohn-Haft from the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia in Brazil, said he believed the females could be risking their hearing to size-up potential mates.Created with Sketch.Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2019: The Winners Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the Year115  Grand title winner and Joint Winner, Behaviour: MammalsThe moment by Yongqing Bao, ChinaYongqing BaoWildlife Photographer of the YearNight glow by Cruz Erdmann, New ZealandCruz ErdmannWildlife Photographer of the Year315 Plants and Fungi WinnerTapestry of life by Zorica Kovacevic, SerbiaUSAZorica KovacevicWildlife Photographer of the YearLand of the eagle by Audun Rikardsen, NorwayAudun RikardsenWildlife Photographer of the Year515 Black and White WinnerSnow exposure by Max Waugh, USAMax WaughWildlife Photographer of the YearThe equal match by Ingo Arndt, GermanyIngo ArndtWildlife Photographer of the YearCreation by Luis Vilariño Lopez, SpainLuis Vilariño LopezWildlife Photographer of the Year815 Wildlife Photographer of the Year Portfolio Award WinnerThe huddle by Stefan Christmann, GermanyStefan ChristmannWildlife Photographer of the Year915 10 years and under WinnerHumming surprise by Thomas Easterbrook, UKThomas EasterbrookWildlife Photographer of the YearAnother barred migrant by Alejandro Prieto, MexicoAlejandro PrietoWildlife Photographer of the YearFrozen moment by Jérémie Villet, FranceJérémie VilletWildlife Photographer of the YearEarly riser by Riccardo Marchgiani, ItalyRiccardo MarchegianiWildlife Photographer of the Year1315 Behaviour: Amphibians and Reptiles WinnerPondworld by Manuel Plaickner, ItalyManuel PlaicknerWildlife Photographer of the YearFace of deception by Ripan Biswas, IndiaRipan BiswasWildlife Photographer of the Year1515 Animals in Their Environment WinnerSnow-plateau nomads by Shangzhen Fan, ChinaShangzhen FanWildlife Photographer of the YearHe said: “We were lucky enough to see females join males on their display perches.

We are truly at the early stages of understanding this bioersity,” he said.One of the new things the researchers learned is that there seems to be a trade-off at work for this behaviour – as bellbird and piha songs get louder, they also get shorter. This may be because the birds’ respiratory systems have a finite ability to control airflow and generate sound.The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The measure for export prospects came in at -46, the lowest since October 2001.“Brexit concerns have clearly driven concern about the near-term outlook for exports, with citations of political and economic uncertainty abroad and quotaimport licence restrictions spiking to multi-decade highs,” the CBI said.Investment intentions also worsened, with planned spending on buildings, plants and machinery, and training and retraining posting the sharpest drops since early to mid-2009, when Britain was still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis.\u0026nbspLikewise, manufacturers expect their output to fall in the next three months at the fastest pace since early 2009, compounding the\u0026nbspdecline between August and October.Hazy trade outlook and jumpy pound seen as top barriers to UK exportsNo-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 impact on car industryUK manufacturing shrinks for fifth month in a row amid Brexit turmoilHeadcount in the sector fell at its fastest since April 2010, with firms anticipating an even sharper decline in the next three months.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the global economic downturn also played a part and noted that the survey was conducted in the first half of October, before the government announced a new Brexit deal.But he added: “With the accompanying political declaration laying out a harder former of Brexit than previously envisaged, with a clear commitment to take Britain out of the customs union, we doubt that manufacturers have become more optimistic since the new deal was struck. The downturn in the manufacturing sector, therefore, looks like it has plenty further left to run.”Boding ill for future output, the survey’s measure for manufacturers’ total order books was at its lowest since January 2010 and worse than expected by economists.Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: “Finding a resolution that avoids a no-deal Brexit will give firms the confidence they need to step up investment in people, growth and innovation.“But for long-lasting prosperity we need an ambitious free trade agreement which provides tariff-free access to our largest trading partner for our manufacturers right across the country.”Another survey showed earlier this month that uncertainties around Brexit and future tariffs, as well as the volatile pound are holding back British exports.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe CBI interviewed 258 firms between 25 September and 14 October.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This study adds to the available information about the financial benefits that inidual students can expect from a degree.We hope to explore this area further in forthcoming years, as new data is released into the public domain.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The New Democratic Party secured 24 seats.Created with Sketch.Murdered and missing indigenous women in US and Canada Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alaya McIvor lost two women close to her as well as experiencing human trafficking, and now speaks out about indigenous rightsRoberta McIvor, cousin of Alaya, was killed in Manitoba, Canada, in 2012A memorial for Eleanor \u0027Laney\u0027 Ewenin who was found dead in 1982Families at the National Inquiry in CanadaFamilies at the National Inquiry in CanadaActivists march for missing and murdered indigenous women at the Women\u0027s March California 2019Activists march for missing and murdered indigenous women at the Women\u0027s March California 2019Erandi Flores and Nadia Bucio, both from Mexico and from a group raising awareness for missing and murdered indigenous women, join thousands at a rally at Cal Anderson Park prior to the Women\u0027s March on January 20, 2018 in Seattle, Washington.Activists march for missing and murdered indigenous women at the Women\u0027s March California 2019Thousands listen to speakers raising awareness of missing and murdered indigenous women at a rally at Cal Anderson Park prior to the Women\u0027s March on January 20, 2018 in Seattle, Washington.

This is oil country. My father has worked in the oil industry. We don’t need foreigners coming in and telling us how to run our business, support our families, put food on our tables … just shut up until you have solutions.”The man\u0026nbspsaid his father, who had recently passed away, would have been “disgusted” by the mural.Later that day, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that they\u0026nbspreturned to find another man adding a French slur.\u0026nbspHe also wrote that\u0026nbspMs Thunberg should leave the country.

They say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.Workers’ rights groups have previously called for mass retraining in renewables to ensure former oil and gas employees are not left behind in the ongoing transition. The energy sector provides 150,000 jobs in the region.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbsptask\u0026nbspthat will last six days, the deal said.\u0026nbspAt that moment Russian and Turkish forces\u0026nbspwill begin joint patrols\u0026nbsp10km into\u0026nbspthe buffer-zone area.\u0026nbspThe agreement, if successfully implemented, will likely\u0026nbspherald the end of Turkey\u0027s incursion in northern Syria.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it. One source jokes that MPs will be “voting on an election every day until they crack”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not an easy tightrope to negotiate, and this wasn’t a simple tour for Kate or William for so many reasons.Obviously, security has had to be incredibly tight, far more so than even they are used to, and both of them will have had a full, and possibly rather alarming, briefing from British security services.Then there’s the bittersweet emotional impact on William, who has been retracing his mother’s footsteps during this trip.Diana visited Pakistan several times as a guest of the now Prime Minister Imran Khan and his then we Jemima Goldsmith. She also fell deeply in love with Pakistani-born surgeon Hasnat Khan, and the country and its people always held a special place in her heart.William would have felt very close to his mum as he reconnected with Imran Khan and then went to the same cancer hospital in Lahore that Diana visited just a year before her death.Kate paid her own tribute with a series of stunning outfits subtly taking inspiration from Diana. It’s at times like these that William must miss his mum, and all credit to him for being able to remember her with love and affection, rather than sorrow and trauma.The show-stopping moment for me was when the royal couple emerged from a highly decorated tuk tuk for a glittering reception in Islamabad.Kate was wearing the most stunning emerald gown I think I have ever seen.It was Oscar red carpet-worthy, andthere aren’t copies on the high street for our Christmas parties very soon I will not be best pleased.She looked equally gorgeous a couple of days later playing cricket while wearing a cream shalwar kameez and white trainers.Kate has quietly and effectively emerged as the Queen’s top asset in the Royal Family.Camilla will obviously never have anything like the same respect and affection as Her Majesty, but skipping a generation, Kate has all the attributes to be a very effective Monarch one day at William’s side. She’s bright, beautul and has a big big heart.Since becoming a mum of three, Kate is a much more confident charity ambassador and public speaker, and she’s developed a real connection with all of the children she meets, putting them at ease and making them smile.If the Royal Family is to survive it will all be down to this quiet but determined woman. It’s a heavy burden to place on such slim shoulders, but Kate is more than up to it.THE late Leah Bracknell might have had terminal cancer, but she lived le to the full.The Emmerdale star, who played Zoe Tate for  years and whose death was announced this week, laughed, loved and seized the day.She didn’t do many interviews, but came in to talk to me on my show a couple of years ago after her diagnosis.Leah was funny, brave and determined not to be defined by her illness. She described herself as a “cancer rebel” and we were overwhelmed with ­messages of support and respect for this remarkable woman.She lived and died on her own terms and will be sadly missed.It will be incredible to have the teeniest, tiniest idea of what incredible people such as Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and our own Helen Sharman and Tim Peake experienced.For a lelong space geek like me, who watched the moon landings and wanted to be part of the crew of Star Trekthis is the trip of a letime.Will tell you all about it when I’m back.WHAT the hell do these clowns calling themselves environmental “warriors” hope to achieve by targeting hard-working people trying to get to work in the morning Scenes on the London Tube this week were deeply disturbing and frightening, andExtinction Rebellion don’t get a grip, someone is going to get seriously hurt – or even killed.At least they have admitted it was a spectacular own goal to pick on the eco-friendly electric underground, especially during rush hour.They know full well such stupidity has alienated many potential sympathisers.Violence can never be condoned, but I completely understand the sheer frustration of men and women who just wanted to get to their jobs on time, and who took action by pulling a demonstrator off the roof of a train as he kicked out.At one point it was like a chilling scene from a horror film.Most of us agree we need to take action to reverse the effects of climate change before it’s too late, but these sorts of daft demos are not the way to win hearts and minds.As well as being disruptive for the sake of it, such inflammatory actions are potentially extremely dangerous.Believe me, there IS such a thing as bad publicity and although we might be talking about Extinction Rebellion, we aren’t discussing the importance and far bigger picture of global warming.I just don’t expect to see such toxic scenes in the UK, and far from being “warriors”, these idiots are best described as another word beginning with W. And I think we all know which one that is.There are many twists and turns, but suffice to say Arnie is back with some hilariously deadpan zingers, the special effects are in a league of their own, andyou don’t shed a tear at the end you are an unfeeling terminator machine.SCOTT MITCHELL is one of the loveliest men in all of the world. He is having to watch his beloved we Barbara Windsor slowly dissolve in front of his eyes due to the s****y disease that is Alzheimer’s.He has been by her side every step of the way and is now full-time carer for a woman who was once the epitome of independence and the le and soul of the party. This week Scott confessed that he feels “racked with guilt”he leaves his beloved Barbara alone even for a few hours.Scott is fiercely protective of the woman he adores and so patient when the illness has her confused and endlessly repeating herself. He and Barbara have raised thousands of pounds for Alzheimer’s charities as well as vital awareness of the disease.I really just want to give Scott a massive hug, tell him he’s doing a brilliant job and he has absolutely nothing to feel guilty about. Obviously It’s desperately sad that our Barbara is going through such a hellish time, but she struck gold when she met and married her Scott.Vile trolls sending death threats to head judge Shirley Ballas after Radio  DJ Dev was booted off the show last weekend really need to take a long, hard look at themselves.You might have vehemently disagreed with their decision and thrown your popcorn, crisps and prosecco at the TV – or was that just me  – when Dianne and Dev danced their last, but can we just hold on and try to put it all into perspective  It’s a wonderful, warm, fuzzy show that is supposed to be pure entertainment.What in the name of Len Goodman is going on when a couple being voted off a TV show ends up causing such pain and distress to a lovely woman like Shirley Strictly stupid, silly and sad.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But so does the EU, which made big concessions and will be horriedtoday’s appalling and disingenuous Letwin amendment opens the door to new wrecking tactics.EU leaders should categorically, finally reject an extension.Business craves certainty.

It is desperate stuff. Those rights would be set by any Government voters elect. And there are no votes in tearing up rights.Other Labour MPs contort logic by claiming Boris’s deal is a “Trojan Horse to No Deal”. It is just dishonest.They claimed their only fear was No Deal. Now a deal is here, they oppose it.At least the DUP has a solid objection. But they should rethink. We believe they are making a historic mistake. So does ex-First Minister David Trimble, Nobel Prize-winning author of the Good Friday Agreement. He backs the deal.All MPs must put aside self-interest now.

It was always nonsense. Boris and the EU will deliver it. Only Remainers’ intransigence stands in the way.They should know this: Voters won’t blame Boris nowBrexit isn’t done. Those days are over.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were so excited about moving in and it’s been nothing but months of pain.“There’s an endless list of things that need fixing but the three bottles of urine under the bath really was disgusting. Why anyone would do such a thing is beyond me.”Graham, of Bridgend, South Wales, blasted building firm Persimmon for “shoddy” work.“The tiles were so bad my dad had to redo them. He said they’d been fixed straight onto the wall without any layer put in between.“The front door barely opens and the whole wall it’s on needs replacing as it isn’t straight. Some windows arent level either and there’s chips in the stone window sills.“Persimmon clearly just do the work as quickly as possible and then once they’d got your money they move onto the next house. They don’t care - it’s a catalogue of shambles - but this is our savings.Graham, who ties the knot with Emma next May, says his concerns were raised when Persimmon advised them not to conduct a snagging report.He ignored them and paid independent building company HomeSnag to carry out their own assessment.After they found  issues with the new build, Graham complained to Persimmon but said no action has yet been taken.He said they have already forked out £, of their own money to pay for new garden slabs and topsoil.He added: “When they said that we don’t need a snagging check I thought something doesn’t feel right.“It’s hard enough planning a wedding, we really don’t need this. Now we’ve moved in Persimmon are just ignoring us. I just want some sort of financial settlement so we can fix the issued ourselves.”Persimmon, which faces questions over profits from the taxpayer-funded Help To Buy scheme, said an inquiry was under way, adding: “We apologise unreservedly to Mr Crowley-Miller.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Dr Liu believes prime editing has the potential to fix  per cent of them.The other  per cent are where people have too many copies of a gene or when the whole gene is missing.Prime editing scans the DNA to find the part that needs to be altered, then uses an enzyme, called a reverse transcriptase, to copy over the correct ­version.

But as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”Royal insiders yesterday revealed William is worried about the pair - who appeared vulnerable - and hoped they are all right.But today the source close to Harry and Meghan said the prince had always talked openly about his mental health.Pals close to the prince praised his answers to the question about his brother as tactful and truthful, whereas others suggested he should have denied any spat or declined to give a response.And this source told CNN he gave a candid and honest answer, adding any sibling would be concerned, hitting out at the public and royal response.It has been reported the princes spoke to each other privately after the documentary aired and the apparent confirmation of the distance between the two was revealed.A source told The Times they would have been in touch, and a line had been drawn in the fallout of Harrys remarks on his sibling relationship.The source added: These are conversations that should take place privately. It is not a topic to play out in public.Askedhe felt Meghan was under similar pressure to Diana, he replied: “You slightly hit the nail on the head.“Everything she went through and that happened to her is incredibly raw, every single day and that’s not me being paranoid.“That’s me just not wanting a repeat of the past.”But another source close to the brothers said: “William has a more nuanced view. He hated the topless pictures of Kate but accepts you have to live with the press.He knows Diana allowed the press too close and co-operated with them.“So you have these two competing narratives and it’s making relations fractious.It is understood the Queen would have been a little bit dismayed by the broadcast of personal relationship details to the public, the Dailyreports.But a Buckingham Palace spokesman wouldnt comment on any private conversations the Monarch may have had with her grandsons.Within hours of airing Palace sources were playing down suggestions William was “furious” with Harry over the documentary.“As Harry has said, he knows his brother is there for him.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBoris Johnson is racing to get MPs to pass his Brexit deal in three days so he isnapost forced to break his vow to leave by Halloween . Opening debate on his -page Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the PM said MPs should vote for his agreement to avoid a no-deal departure and move our country on. Otherwise, he warned, he could abandon the Bill altogether and push for an election. But he was forced to rely on some eyebrow-raising arguments as MPs threatened to vote down his three-day timetable and give the Bill more scrutiny. That, in turn, would make him almost certain to miss the October  deadline. If we pass this Bill tonight we will have the opportunity to address the priorities not just of our relations with the EU, but the peopleaposs priorities at home, he said. If we do this deal,we pass this deal and the legislation that enables it, we can turn the page and allow this country and this Parliament to begin to heal and unite. The problem is, Mr Johnson may have been less than totally honest with MPs while trying to persuade them. Here are some lies or half-truths he told the Commons.    WHAT HE SAID: For the vast majority of the Northern Irish economy, Northern Ireland exits with the rest of the UK whole and entire. WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: Northern Ireland will share single market rules with the EU. This means many animal products from Britain need checking at border posts, which carries a fee of at least £. As for customs rules, while legally Northern Ireland will share a territory with the UK not the EU, customs checks will still happen on goods from the rest of the UK. Thataposs because they will have EU tarfs appliedtheyaposre at risk of moving into the EU at a later date. Government analysis of the deal says goods sent from Britain to Belfast will need two customs forms signed, raising costs for business - and putting a border down the Irish Sea.    WHAT HE SAID: There are no checks GB-NI. There will be some light touch measures to ensure there is no illegal trade in endangered animal species and banned firearms, Mr Johnson told the DUPaposs Nigel Dodds when asked about customs checks. Later he added: There will be no checks, I repeat, there will be no checks GB-NI. WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: On customs, the governmentaposs own impact assessment says: Goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be required to complete both import declarations and Entry SummaryDeclarations because the UK will be applying the EU’s Customs Code in Northern Ireland. This will result in additional administrative costs to businesses. On single market rules, the assessment says: There will be additional documentation required on all agri-food goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to ensure that they comply with the necessary regulations... There would be additional fees to cover document and physical inspections as well as Export Health Certicates and other administrative checks prior to arrival at the border.    WHAT HE SAID: The House will know full well that these are transitory arrangements. Andthe people of Northern Ireland choose to dissent from them, they melt away unless by a majority they keep to retain them. WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: It is true that Northern Irelandaposs Assembly will get a vote every four years on whether to keep the customs arrangements. But itaposs hardly transitory. The first vote is almost four years after the end of the transition period - so late , oritaposs extended by two years, late . At that point they can continue by a simple majority, without cross-community support. Andthey do get both unionists and nationalists, then the arrangements are even less transitory - continuing for another eight years without a vote.    WHAT HE SAID: Fisheries will not be a bargaining chip, we will take back % of the marine wealth of this country. WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: Access to Britainaposs coastal waters and quotas on what fish can be caught, where and when, will not default to the UK governmentaposs sole control. Instead it will be decided by negotiations between the EU and UK as part of a future trade deal. Negotiations which, you would imagine, might involve plenty of bargaining.    WHAT HE SAID: “ Once more under this agreement British people will be able to live under laws made by representatives whom they elect and who they alone can elect and remove. Laws enforced by British judges in British courts.” WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: Clause  of the European UnionBill makes clear that it replaces the European Communities Act  - which gave effect to the UKaposs membership of the European Economic Community. However it also makes clear that the Act, which means that the UK is subject to the ECJ, continues to have effect in domestic law. And it means that during transition the UK will remain subject to not only existing, but also any new, EU law. . There can be aposno regressionapos on workersapos rights    WHAT HE SAID: People will need reassurance about this. There can be no regression. The UK will maintain the highest possible standards. If the EU decides that it wishes to introduce a new piece of legislation on social protection then it is of course automatic that this House should consider that, consider. And as I say there will be an amendable motion by which the Government will give parliamentary time for the implementation... of that measure. WHAT HIS DEAL ACTUALLY SAYS: The legislation sets out that workersapos rights currently derived from EU law will continue to be applied in the UK, including the the Working Time Directive and the Agency Workersapos Regulations. But crucially the agreement moved that commitment for a regression lock from the legally binding text with the EU to an aspiration for future negotiations - and leaves it in the hands of future parliaments. The Bill also says ministers wonapost have to guarantee every future law would not regress on EU workersapos rights. Instead they can make a statement refusing to make that guarantee. TUC General Secretary Frances OaposGrady has said the Workersapos Rights proposals in the WAB were meaningless, adding: We still have no legally binding guarantee that UK rights will keep pace with EU minimum standards. Boris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on  October , though it still needs approval by MPs. The -page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to  December  and the £bn orce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic. In the backstopaposs place would effectively be apostwo bordersapos in a hybrid system:Northern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the -mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below.  Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.The Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term. Meanwhile commitments on workersapos rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.

The National Audit Office is speaking to welfare chiefs after they refused to say how many inquests of people who took their own lives had taken evidence from the DWP. Frank Field, chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, asked for the information last month in a bid to understand any possible link between suicide and the benefit system. The ex-Labour MP asked for the number of inquests since  that ed a verdict of suicide had taken evidence from the DWP. He also asked for the number of inquests in which it was ruled that the policies of the DWP were partly responsible for the deceased person’s state of mind.  Ministers said the information was not held centrally and would cost more than a £ cost threshold to retrieve. So Mr Field referred the case to Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.

The risk soaring five-fold for Alzheimer’s and by signicant,slightly smaller, rates for motor neurone and Parkinson’s diseases cannot be swept off pitches and ignored. Why this research wasn’t commissioned earlier showed a lack of care yet now we have the terrying statistics the sport’s ruling bodies must start a national conversation about what to do. Balls are lighter than the heavier leather versions which caused West Brom star Jeff Astle’s death in  but serious thought must be given to whether, for example, heading is outlawed in matches involving the youngest boys and girls.    Immediate answers, whatever the might be, are unlikely instantly but an immediate debate is vital when the health dangers were ignored for far too long. Maybe the result might be warnings to players rather than changes but let’s start a national conversation.

But when mum Sue lost her mum to diabetes it gave the family the push they needed to change their lives for good. Sue, , dad Roy, , and sons Ben, , and Simon, , joined the gym together to embark on a whole family body transformation which has seen them shed a staggering six and a half stone between them in just six months and get gym-honed bodies they could only previously have dreamed of. Out went the bacon and egg butties, boozy meals out and fat-laden takeaways. In came healthy meals, gym sessions and family activity outings that upped their daily step counts. In six months Sue has lost . stone, Roy, two stone, and Ben and Simon have lost a stone between them as well as building muscle.    And they all agree it has changed their lives for good - and brought them closer together as a family. Housewe Sue says: “I had got to a point in my le where I needed to make some big changes. I had a family history of diabetes and that was something I saw for myselfI continued on the path I was on. I really felt that I needed to address my diet, my exercise. “After the death of my mum, because it was related to diabetes, it was really important to get myself sorted and not go down that same track. The way that I have dealt with my grief, this has given me a real focus, to focus on myself and get myself healthy rather than focusing on grief. “Being overweight made me feel that I had lost myself. I felt like a big person had eaten a small person. I started noticing results within two weeks. The weight started coming off, and once that happens you really get the motivation to keep going.” The family joined the Ultimate Performance gym in Manchester where former Emmerdale actress trains with “Evil Steve” - the man she credits with giving her her killer body.     As well as gruelling workouts, the McGillivray family’s trainer Anthony Paulhe gave them nutrition plans and meal ideas which completed changed their attitude to food - and encouraged them to change their lestyles for good. Dad Roy, managing director of a dental firm, says: “My diet and lestyle was probably pretty average. I was working hard. I wouldn’t eat breakfast in the morning, I would have something mid-miring at work, fatty food, bacon and egg sandwich, sometimes I would take lunch, sometimes I wouldn’t. “In the evening I would find myself eating takeaway food because I was too tired to prepare something. You may go to the pub after work for tea, but then you would end up having two or three drinks, so then you were consuming more alcohol. That was the lestyle. “I never realised how unhealthy I was until I had my measurements done. I had never considered myself to be obese - but I was obese. “That has got a bearing on your le. You reach a certain age, andyou allow your fitness levels to be poor and your diet to be unhealthy then you have to pay a price for that. If you look after yourself then age really is just a number.  “Why would you not want to look in the mirror and see that person looking back is fit and healthy  “I did this for myself and my family. But when people start to notice your transformation and make comments, you feel ft tall. When you go shopping and buy new clothes and they fit nice you feel good about yourself. “I think the le-changing thing for me personally is taking the numbers away. I feel no dferent today at  than I did at , I probably feel better than I did at . To be able to say that is incredible. I think it has given me longevity, energy and focus.” Sue has lost so much weight that people who hadn’t seen her for a while barely recognised her. And they all want to know the secret to her success.  “The dference in me now compared to how I first started, I feel like a dferent person.,” she says. “I feel so much more confident, I feel like I have got back to who I am. I feel great. When you get dressed and people give you compliments it is nice, but ultimately it is how you feel in yourself, being able to look in the mirror and liking what you see. I am happy.” And sons Ben and Simon are so proud of the changes their parents have made - and say training together brought out their competitive streaks and helped keep them all on track.    Simon explains: “There has been competitiveness between us which I think gives you additional motivation. We have always done things together as a family but tow we have found healthier things to do - go for a healthy meal, or go bowling together. We still have quality time, but we make healthier choices. “Training together as a family has definitely brought us closer together. We have supported each other, there have been challenges along the way but we kept each other on track. “The change in my mum has been unbelievable. I hadn’t realised how down she was. But the change in her over the course of the last six months has been incredible. I look at how she is now - she is enjoying le and that rubs off on the rest of the family.” For more information on Ultimate Performance visit upfitness "},{"url":null,"title":"inside 11000 year uni pad","story":"NewsInside £,-a-year uni pad that students fled because of dirt and stainsFormer tenants have complained about issues from soiled mattresses and a singed sofa to \"bodily fluid\" on the walls of the house in NewcastleShareCommentsByIan JohnsonSam Elliott:,  OCT NewsFed-up James Easby is taking matters into his own hands \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Timothy Higgins, , is accused of driving at Christopher Gadd, , after the pair exchanged v signs over a parking space dispute. Higgins, who held a provisional driving licence, drove at his alleged victim to s*** him up before knocking him backwards onto the road, resulting in him dying from serious head injuries, the court heard. Mr Gadd had been a passenger in his brotheraposs car which momentarily blocked Higginsapos Land Rover Freelander from reversing out of a space on the afternoon of March  this year in Pontllanfraith, South Wales.  Prosecutor Owen Williams told Cardf Crown Court: Unable to reverse momentarily, Higgins became annoyed and gestured at the brothers and they gestured back. The v sign was used. Higgins eventually managed to reverse out of his space and drove to another part of the car park, while Mr Gadd followed him on foot to remonstrate with him. The court was told that while Mr Gadd was walking on the car parkaposs carriageway, Higgins drove towards him.  Mr Williams said: As Higgins approached where Mr Gadd was positioned in the carriageway, he deliberately swerved his motor vehicle to the right in order to drive at him. As a result of him doing so Higginsapos motor vehicle collided with Mr Gadd with a slight glancing blow. Witness Maggie Pridley told police she saw the Land Rover turning into the man before its front driveraposs side corner struck Mr Gadd.  Mr Williams said Mr Gadd fell backwards to the road and sustained signicant and fatal head injuries, resulting in him bleeding from his ears and nostrils, and despite the efforts of shoppers and paramedics to revive him he was pronounced dead at the scene. His cause of death was later given as blunt force head injury including complex skull fractures. The prosecutor said it was not suggested Higgins intended to kill Mr Gadd or to cause him serious harm, but that by driving in the manner he did he unlawfully assaulted his alleged victim.

Emily Roebuck took the sedative before getting behind the wheel of her Peugeot . After police pulled her over in Manchester city centre in January, tests showed ketamine levels in her blood were more than  times the limit for the driving on the drug. Roebuck, from leafy Bramhall in Stockport, was arrested for a second time just five weeks later in Stockport after a passer-by found her slumped in the driveraposs seat. They moved her into the passenger seat, fearing she would drive off.   While police were investigating those incidents, Roebuck ploughed her Peugeot into the back of a car.    She had been trying to read Google Maps on her phone. Roebuck drove away as police travelled to the scene, but she crashed into two other vehicles. A Mercedes A, a Seat Ibiza and a VW High Up were damaged in the incident near her former home in Hayfield, Derbyshire. Tests showed she was more than four times the drug drive limit for ketamaine and almost twice the limit for the painkiller diazapam.   Roebuck admitted two charges of drug driving possessing diazepam and failing to stop after an accident at Stockport Magistratesapos Court. She was banned from the road for three years.    Roebuck was disqualied for  months for the first drug driving offence at a hearing in June. She has to get two buses to work. The court heard the three incidents happened between January  and April  after Roebuck obtained the drugs while battling anxiety and depression. On the first occasion, she was stopped on Ducie Street in Manchester city centre. Tests showed ketamine levels in her blood of  microgrammes per litre of blood. The driving limit for ketamine is  microgrammes per litre of blood. Roebuck was released under investigation, before being caught at the wheel of her car in Cheadle, Stockport, at .pm on March  while under the influence of drugs.  Victoria Newman, prosecuting, said: Police were called initially to reports of a drunk driver slumped at the wheel of a Peugeot . A member of the public had moved the female over to the passenger side as feared her driving away.   The police noticed the defendant was drowsy and under the influence of some substance her eyes being glazed and slurring her words. She was asked to take a seat in the police van, but needed assistance of police to get over there. She was found to have a packet of blue tablets, which she admitted were diazepam. She said they were not prescribed to her, but that she just buys them and had taken one before driving.  The last offence happened on April , when police stopped Roebuck at .pm in New Mills, Derbyshire, just outside Stockport.  Ms Newman added: The witness said she was stationary in her car and waiting for traffic to pass, when her vehicle was struck from behind by the defendants car. It was hit with enough force to set off both of the airbags.   The witness got out of her vehicle and told the defendant not to move whilst she called . The witness was askingshe was okay, but the defendant then left the scene before the police arrived. She then came to a stop after colliding with another two vehicles and police and ambulance attended the scene. She was arrested on suspicion in possession of a controlled substance and it was confirmation that ketamine was in her system. Tests showed levels of ketamine and diazepam in Roebuckaposs blood were  microgrammes per litre of blood and  microgrammes per litre of blood respectively. The driving limit for diazapam is  microgrammes per litre of blood. In mitigation, defence lawyer Steve McHugh said: aposaposI don’t think it’s been my clients finest three months in her le. But she has cooperated throughout and entered guilty pleas at the first opportunity. Itaposs unfortunate that all matters could not have been dealt with together, but she is under no illusions as to the serious predicament sheaposs in.   Since this happened, however, she has happily turned her le around and gained employment.  She has effectively taken on board all the assistance that could be offered as she suffers from anxiety and depression.

Further, the public will be wise to such behaviour in future towards women by you and others like you.

The now -year-old had been diagnosed with uterine fibroids and told she was basically infertile. But Elizabeth has a far rarer condition - Uterus Didelphys - which means she has two vaginas, two wombsand two cervixes. She have birth to her aposmiracleapos daughter in , just two years after doctors diagnosed her with uterine fibroids – noncancerous growths in the uterus. Elizbabeth, who is originally from Ghana, but moved to UK from France in , said: “In  when I was diagnosed with uterine fibroids, I was told that conceiving was going to be very dficult for me.    “They basically told me I was actually infertile, so when I fell pregnant it was a huge surprise. Because of Elizabethaposs double womb, which doctors were unaware of, they scanned the wrong mean. Elizabeth was told she was suffering from an ectopic pregnancy, which is when a fertilised egg grows outside the womb and can be fatal. She said: “It was a challenging pregnancy, I was bleeding throughout, fainting and feeling tired. “They actually thought it was ectopic pregnancy as they didnapost know I have a double womb, and nor did I.    “I would go to have a scan, which I had to do frequently because of my fibroids, and one minute they would see the baby is in the womb, then the next they could not find the baby. “Sometimes they were scanning the wrong womb, I had  scans and no-one pointed out I had a double womb – because it’s so rare they weren’t looking out for it. “They’d say ‘We cannot see the baby, maybe the fibroids are hiding the baby’ and persisted in saying I should have a termination, but my belly was growing and I realized “actually it’s a baby” and I was determined to carry it to birth. “The day my daughter was born was a miracle because during the pregnancy it didnapost feel real.” Elizabeth, from Walsall, West Midlands, was finally diagnosed with Uterus Didelphys in  – five years after her daughter was born.    Uterus Didelphys is a congenital abnormality that occurs when two smaller tubes in a female fetus fail to fuse into a single uterus, instead growing into two separate structures. The mother-of-one married her husband Rashid, the father of her child, in , and was finally given her diagnosis. Elizabeth said: “It was kind of a shock, you want answers to your health but that wasn’t what I was expecting. “It was new, I had never heard of anyone born with a double womb, then in  they did keyhole surgery and found I also had two cervixes and two vaginas.” The surgery also revealed that Elizabeth had stage five endrometriosis – a painful disorder where uterine tissue grows outside the uterus – on her bladder.    She became pregnant again in  but had a ‘silent miscarriage’ – a miscarriage without bleeding – at four months. Tragically, Elizabeth had to have a medical abortion and evacuation of the womb to remove the fetus. The experience inspired her to share her medical history with her daughter.   She said: “When I got pregnant I told my daughter “Mommy is pregnant again”, but she was asking me “Why are you always in the hospital ”   “It was only when I lost the baby and she saw me crying and that I said “Mommy has two wombs”. We had a scan for her last year and she’s fine.”    On the back of her miscarriage, Elizabeth decided to set up Speciallady, an organisation dedicated to educating women and young girls on gynaecological conditions and menstrual hygiene.   She said: “I always say that Speciallady is my second baby. I want to be the voice of the voiceless for every woman out there who is going through symptoms like what I went through. “My condition means that I am high risk of cervical cancer or oian cancer, so I decided I wanted to live out my dreams.” As well as advocacy work in her home town, where Elizabeth recently presented to a local youth group, she now travels back to her native Ghana several times a year to share her knowledge with women in communities where talk of gynecological issues can still be taboo. She said: “As an African woman, a lot of mothers die needlessly or people think these conditions are witchcraft.

Instead they pulled their oldest child Dereon, seven, out of school in  and taught him at home. Since then they have had three other children Aerity, three, Aeviny, one,and eight-month-old Derek James, who will be taught the same way as their brother.    Unlike with the structure of school and classes, their days y and they have chosen not to enforce a strict schedule to give them their children freedom. The family from Ohio in the US, take regular hikes in the city, visit cultural places like the Cincinnati Childrenaposs museum, Contemporary Arts Centre and the Cincinnati Zoo. The biggest educational tool they use for their children to learn is Netflix where they watch many nature, wildle and environmental documentaries that their children pick out, like Our Planet, Le Story, Abstract, Oceans and Blue Planet. While they also use YouTube as a source they do allocate a few times a week on using workbooks or worksheets, they donapost spend more than  minutes to an hour on this.    They feel this type of learning will prepare their kids for the real world instead of using their time being tested in exams or learning about subjects that may not benefit them in the future. We let the kids pretty much take charge whatever they ask about or want to know about is what our lesson will be or what we plan for a future lesson, Taylor said. I try to do a lot of play-based learning as well we go to the zoo and museums and learning centres a lot! We do some structured learningbut try to keep it as minimal as possible. We also watch lots of documentaries and use Netflix as one of our biggest tools. To us itaposs basically schooling our own way I want the kids to learn through hands-on experiences.  We eventually want to school them around the world and travel to dferent countries and continents and learn about everything literally on the go. We want them to learn through real le, there so many lessons that canapost be taught in a classroom of thirty-eight. Thereaposs so much not taught in schools that we want our children to learn and I donapost believe in standardised testing and all that hoopla. What we do works really well for us and our children are so smart people are always amazed after having conversations with them. Itaposs the best choice weaposve made for our children, I think.  Benefits of being able to use Netflixis we can look up a show or series on basically anything the kids ask or want to know about. Weaposve watched quite a few Netflix documentaries Our Planet, Le Story, Abstract, Oceans, Blue Planet, Explained, Natureaposs Weirdest Events, Growing Up Wild, Age of Tanks, and more. Some of their other favourite shows are Motown Magic, Wild Kratts, Super Why, Word Party, Storybots, and The Magic School Bus. I think these are educational because theyaposre watching and learning words, problem solving, kindness, creativity, fun facts, manners and so much more in a way and through characters they enjoy.  Our days y we donapost really have a strict schedule or anything like that. We do try to get a workbook or worksheet in after breakfast a few times a week, but donapost spend more than thirty minutes to an hour on them. My kids are always asking questions and wanting to know about or more about something, theyaposre constantly learning even when weaposre not trying. Which is kind of the whole point in unschooling to me. Taylor says that they plan to travel around the world full-time with their children once they can afford it, for them to learn about real-le events. Right now, the plan is to continue home-schooling and eventually world-school when we are financially able, she said.  Mostly what we find unappealing about traditional school is that itaposs all about standardised testing and regurgitating information. Youaposre not there to learn youaposre there to recite information and get good test scores. Not to mention all the important things that they donapost teach, like accurate historical events and African American culture and history. On top of that it doesnapost nurture imagination and creativity children arenapost meant to sit down and be still and quiet for six to eight hours a day. They are supposed to run around and touch things and ask a billion silly questions. My children have lots of friends that they see regularly and absolutely no problem making new friends. My oldest is the most outgoing child Iaposve probably ever met.

It will hurt her, but she deserves the truth. Also, I think itaposs a HUGE mistake to give it a week.

Itaposs bad newsyour child is called Mia or Jack, which were chosen as the UKaposs naughtiest names. All agreed that boys with the name Jack are the most likely to misbehave, with % of the vote, and the name gets a particularly bad rap from teachers who admit to expecting Jacks to be mean to their classmates.    For girls, Mia is the name teachers and parents associate with mischief, although children themselves expect Emilys to be the naughtiest. Bad behaviour is also closely linked to intellect, with those called Jack and Mia considered to be the least intelligent. As many as % of teachers, children and parents donapost associate the name Mia with being clever. Ouch.

For boys, Arthur takes top spot, with just % of those surveyed expecting Arthurs to misbehave and the name being associated with being quiet and shy, as is the name Noah.    For girls, Grace is considered to be the shyest in class, with teachers, parents and children agreeing the name tends to belong to the most introverted kids. In contrast, the names Charlie and Olivia are assumed to be the most confident.

For boys, little ones expect Harrys to be the most spoilt in the playground. Managing director at My Nametags, Lars B. Andersen, said: “We know that there are strong stereotypes attached to names and that someone’s first name can really paint a picture of what they are like.

As it is so young, a temporary foster home has been arranged until the dog is old enough to get vaccinations.

Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests. He added:“We can have concerts for up to , at slessor Gardens but we’d like to have concerts which host , people. That means we can bring acts to Dundee which would pass us over on a regular basis.“We’ll have conference space which can offer -, spaces and that’s what we want to go after.#John Nelms insists Dundee are in the process of recovering after relegation last season.The managing director says changes behind the scenes have seen the club moving in a dferent direction, after the appointments of James McPake as manager and Gordon Strachan as technical director.He said: “The Championship has been a big change, luckily we planned for some change and it has allowed us to move a few things around the club.“Obviously the manager has changed, we’re changing things in the academy by bringing Gordon in and once we got through all the negativity of being relegated we could focus on bringing the club back up again.“I think we’ve done that. We have a young manager and he has a lot of good people around him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da9b21fc578c4.50609098.jpg ","title":"louis appere ive got perfect role model in mcculloch","story":"Young Dundee United striker Louis Appere says he’s got the perfect role model in former Rangers and Scotland man Lee McCulloch.The ex-Kilmarnock player and manager has taken -year-old Appere under his wing at Tannadice as the youngster has emerged into the first team.Both are celebrating along with manager Robbie Neilson and McCulloch’s fellow-assistant Gordon Forrest after signing contract extensions until the summer of .Appere said: “Lee McCulloch has been brilliant with me and really helped me a lot.“He has played in the same position as me and has helped with a lot of dferent things, looking back at games, training drills that he wants me to work on and things I can do better.“If I can aim for it, I’d be very happy to have a career like his.“He just tells me to believe in myself, that’s the big thing and take what I do in training into games.“I feel I’m starting to do that now.”Appere has shot to prominence in the United first team after impressing in pre-season.He’s featured  times this campaign for the Tangerines, scoring twice, and is determined to kick on now he has his future at the club sealed, for the next two-and-a-half years anyway.“I’m really happy to get it all signed and done,” Appere said.“Since I came in at the start of the season, it’s been great.“I maybe didn’t expect to start the very first game but the manager gave me a chance after a good pre-season so I now want to repay the faith he has shown in me.“I think going out on loan to Broughty Athletic in the juniors last season gave me a lot of confidence which has helped.“All the coaches at United, too, have been great with me through pre-season and then coming in for the first few games, they were all really positive.“I always backed myself in the first teamI got a chance.“I knew I would at least give everything I had.”He added: “This contract is a big moment.“Before the season, I wasn’t a first-team regular and now to be classed as that is a good feeling – I just want to make sure I stay a first-team regular now.”Appere is in the squad for today’s clash at Queen of the South as the Tangerines aim to get back to winning ways following the - defeat to Alloa a fortnight ago."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street is shankland here to stay and can dundee do dens double","story":"This week Tele sports reporters George Cran, Calum Woodger and Graeme Finnan discuss whether Lawrence Shankland has done enough to be Scotland’s No , can Dundee win back-to-back for the first time and what has Calum got against Robert Snodgrass Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/Stars-Anthony-Beauregard-chases-the-loose-puck-as-he-powers-past-Blazes-Janne-Laakkonen_33194801-Read-Only.jpg ","title":"winless league run continues as dundee stars lose to coventry blaze and sheffield steelers","story":"Kitmart Dundee Stars lost out in two tight games as they were beaten - at home by Coventry Blaze and - away by Sheffield Steelers. This means they are without a win in their last five league matches.Speaking after Saturday’s - defeat against Coventry, Stars coach Omar Pacha said: “The positives are we played better defensively but we didn’t have that spark offensively or the jump we usually have.”Following Sunday’s loss, the Canadian mentioned how defensive mistakes cost his team late in the game and how frustrating it is to be on the wrong side of controversial calls.Blaze held a - lead after the first period as Evan Bloodoff capitalised on a Dundee turnover in the eighth minute.However, when both teams went down to four skaters each in the second period, Kevin Dufour put Stars back on level terms as he went clean through on the Coventry goal and dispatched the puck through the legs of Jamie Phillips on the halfway mark.The West Midlands club nicked the two points in the final period as Alex Forbes scored a shorthanded goal in the th minute.Yesterday, Stars were in Yorkshire where they were beaten - by Sheffield Steelers.The scoring was opened when Dundee’s captain Matt Marquardt was in the penalty box for slashing. On the resulting powerplay, Marc-Olivier Vallerand fired a shot into the top-left corner after  minutes.Robert Dowd quickly doubled Steelers’ lead as he batted in the rebound of Ben O’Connor’s shot a minute later.However, the goal was reviewed for a high-stick foul but, after a lot of deliberation, the call on the ice stood, much to the Stars boss Pacha’s frustration.Aaron Fox’s men were in top gear and added a third goal in the th minute as Tanner Eberle pulled the puck around a charging Leclerc and tucked it into the Stars net as he was taken down by the Dundee goaltender.Sheffield held onto their three-goal cushion going into the first break but, early in the second period, the visitors hit back to cut the deficit to - as Brett Stovin was on hand to turn in the rebound of Jagger Dirk’s blocked shot.Pacha’s men were on top for most of the second session and, in the third, Stars closed in again.While on the powerplay, Dundee’s Elgin Pearce pulled one back to make it - on  minutes.The Canadian forward was in space and picked out by Anthony Beauregard before he released a quick shot that flew past Duba and deflected down off the crossbar.The Tayside team were only within one goal of the Steelmen for five minutes as Sheffield restored their two-goal lead after  minutes.Steelers’ Eric Meland released a fast and low shot that hit the leg of Eberle and that was enough to deflect the puck past Leclerc, making it -.Despite Dundee going all out in the final few minutes, the home side held on to claim a - home win.Dundee’s next matches see them face another tough test with a trip to Belfast Giants on Friday night before a home clash against Glasgow Clan on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

at Fir Park.The triumvirate were influential to the result achieved by the Reds in Lanarkshire.Boss Derek McInnes was short of central midfield options due to the suspension of Lewis Ferguson, injuries to Funso Ojo and Scott Wright, with Craig Bryson and Stephen Gleeson only being fit enough for the bench.That meant McInnes pitched defenders Vyner and Leigh into holding midfield roles, with Gallagher operating just in front of the duo.Despite Vyner and Leigh being played in unnatural positions they performed superbly, with the Bristol City loanee scoring the third goal and the man on loan from NAC Breda setting up the first.Gallagher, on loan from Atlanta United, enjoyed playing beside Vyner and Leigh and says it was easy to strike up a relationship in the middle of the park.The Irishman, , said: “Credit has to go to the boys next to me because the two of them were excellent.“The three of us just helped one another. They’re not really familiar with that spot.“But I thought they looked like they’d been playing there for years.“The gaffer spoke to us and gave us a bit of confidence.“He said go in and win our inidual battles and help one another.“Me, Greg and Zak are like best friends, so it was easy for us to do the job for another guy. You know he will get you back.“We worked well on Saturday.”The victory at Fir Park came at a good time for Aberdeen.Prior to the success in Lanarkshire, the Dons had won only one of their previous five games – a run which included a - reverse at Ibrox – which led to mumblings of discontent among the Red Army.With champions Celtic the visitors to Pittodrie on Sunday, Gallagher hopes the victory over Motherwell can be a turning point. He added: “Hopefully it is. The international break helped us a bit.“Obviously the run of results we had wasn’t ideal.“But it helped being able to rest, clear our heads, get back to the training ground and think about putting in a performance for ourselves and the fans.“I think we’re all happy with the performance, but we don’t want to celebrate too much – there’s a job to be done again next week, so you want to build towards that.”Striker Sam Cosgrove set the ball rolling for Aberdeen at the weekend as he dinked in the opener against the Steelmen.The -year-old has netted  times in  games this season, and Gallagher says Cosgrove is being rewarded for his hard work in training.He said: “You want your striker to do what he does and have confidence when he’s through on goal.“That little dink showed where Sam is at.“I honestly couldn’t pick which goal was best because they were all very high quality and I’m buzzing for the guys who got the goals.“Sam definitely has an inner confidence, which shows.“But he is a humble boy who works super hard in training and we all respect that.“He makes my job easier because his hold-up play is getting better every week. I think that’s something that goes unnoticed, and his work-rate too.“Sam and myself had a job to do on their centre-backs and the holding midfielder and he’s helping me just as much as I’m helping him.”Captain Joe Lewis also played an important role in the Reds ing to winning ways as the keeper saved James Scott’s early penalty.Gallagher said: “That’s what you need your captain to do – to step up and have those moments.“We all know Joe is capable of doing that and I thought that save helped to set the tone and push us on for the rest of the match.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.41742191-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.41742191-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.41742191-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.41742191-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen road closed to allow lorry to be recovered","story":"An Aberdeen road has been closed following a lorry breakdown.Officers have urged drivers to avoid School Road in Seaton to allow the heavy goods vehicle to be recovered.A tweet from police said: #School road, Seaton will be closed for a short time whilst a broken down HGV is recovered.#Please avoid the area for the time being.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/EE-KF-141019-01-02-450x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet lexi lola and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This sweet girl is nine years old.She’s a friendly pup, but being a little older she doesn’t want to live with young children or other dogs or cats.Lexi loves playing with her toys, especially footballs!

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles.

I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it.

group across a third of Syria at the cost of thousands of Kurdish fightersrsquo lives.The American pullout has proven chaotic and stumbling.It ran into a new hitch when neighbouring Iraq said Tuesday that the American forces did not have permission to stay on its territory.The Iraqi announcement seemed to contradict US defence secretary Mark Esper, who a day earlier said the forces leaving Syria would deploy in Iraq to fight the so-called Islamic State group.Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey announced their agreement after six hours of talks and poring over maps of Syria at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.Under the -point deal, Kurdish fighters would have  hoursstarting at noon on Wednesday, meaning, until next Tuesday at pm, to withdraw from the

would begin along a six-mile wide strip of the border.The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

Since its inception in , the award has only twice before been shared. First was in , when Nadine Gordimer and Stanley Middleton were twinned, and again in , with Michael Ondaatje and Barry Unsworth. After that regrettable outcome, whereby both writersrsquo thunder was stolen, the rules were changed, vetoing this ever happening again.During rsquos final meeting, Florence and his team ndash Liz Calder, Xiaolu Guo, Afua Hirsch and Joanna McGregor ndash were reluctant or unable to make a clear-cut decision. Asking for advice, they were reminded of the rules. Gaby Wood, of the Booker Prize Foundation, reported that, ldquoThey were not so much ided as unwilling to jettison any more when they finally got down to two, and askedthey might split the prize between them. On being told that it was definitively against the rules, the judges held a further discussion and chose to flout them. They left the judging room happy and proud...Should they be proud  I donrsquot think so. That rule was in place to prevent exactly what is already happening. The impact on an author of winning this prestigious title can be dramatic, as last yearrsquos laureate, Anna Burns, made clear in her speech to the literati in Londonrsquos glitzy medieval Guildhall. Gaining the imprimatur of the Booker brings a blaze of international attention, and a Himalayan spike in sales that no sensible novelist would dare dream of, for fear of waking up to the grim reality of meagre royalties that make the living wage look like a Euro Lottery windfall.Margaret Atwood, a previous winner, hinted as much when accepting the accolade. More than anyone, she understands the stakes. This was attention she does not need, her career already illustrious, and she was gracious in acknowledging that. Perhaps she also knows The Testaments isnrsquot in the same class as some of her earlier work. It is not one of the best books Irsquove read this year, although one that is ndash Lucy Ellmannrsquos Ducks, Newburyport, which was shortlisted ndash was a strong contender for first place.Atwood, to my mind, was given her share of the trophy because of the hype around her long-awaited follow-up and its cult following, thanks in large part to the recent television series. But even had it been her finest novel yet, the judges have been cruel to Bernardine Eisto. She is the first black woman to win, a good news story by any standards. That triumph should have been shouted from the rooftops. What a great statement it would have been for her to have been selected, head and shoulders above the rest. Instead, a  that consisted of four women and one man did a disservice to a writer who deserved the full glory, and the full commercial boost, that this distinction brings.The make-up of the judging  is interesting, reflecting the need for greater ersity, and less male dominance, in literary decision-making. And yet this predominantly female group, drawn from a iety of backgrounds and disciplines, blew it. What might have been a historic moment, representing a signicant cultural turning point, has had its impact blunted, its signicance diminished.The reasoning behind this is hard to understand. With five members, it cannot be impossible to have a majority for one particular title. A resolute chair would usually insist on that, gradually eliminating books to reach a single choice. Previous judges have spoken of the angst and turmoil in that final meeting, as the clock ticks down to the ceremony that evening. Last-minute deals are struck, compromises conceded, arguments clinched. For the chair especially, blood pressure mounts at the thought of facing the cameras with a speech when as yet no name has been picked.The reasons for deciding the award on the day of the ceremony are obvious: fear of a leak ruining the live announcement. Yetit is possible to sign waivers in order to get hold of embargoed books ahead of publication, as happened with The Testaments, which was shrouded in Harry Potter-style secrecy, Bookerrsquos organisers can surely bind the judges to keep their choice under wraps overnight. If the final meeting could instead be held without a gun to the head, in itself a form of literary roulette, cooler heads and better counsel would prevail. Perhaps, like a jury in a murder trial, the five could be holed up incommunicado in a hotel until the award night arrives. Better still, they could simply promise to say nothing and then, for the space of  hours, keep their word. How novel would that be What this split decision suggests is that in the judgesrsquo minds, the entire shortlist was worthy of the prize, and they wanted to show as little favouritism as they could. Yet what is the point of a le-changing pound, rewardnot to anoint a standout victor  In effect, this attitude is an echo of the ideology that says we are all successes, and nobody should ever be declared a runner-up or loser in a race or an exam. By insisting on a double honour, ostensibly for big-hearted reasons, the judges have in fact ducked the tough responsibility with which they were charged.Whatever its impact on Atwood and Eisto, this two-hander feels horribly, tediously familiar. Just picture the scene, as the adjudication meeting dragged on for hours. Indecision, a mounting sense of impasse, endless, increasingly feverish discussions, and a leader who could not or would not break the deadlock. After this, a last-ditch soliciting of professional opinion, followed by a flagrant breaking of the rules. In this sense, at least, Booker rsquos unsatisfactory outcome is very much a story of our times."},{"url":null,"title":"global-superstar-dj-martin-garrix-provide-sound-uefa-euro-2020","story":"The -year-old revealed the news while performing a headline show in his hometown of Amsterdam, one of the  host cities for next summerrsquos finals.As his blinding set and dazzling lighting show thrilled the sold-out gig at Amsterdam RAI, he provided an unexpected encore by walking out with the famous Henri Delaunay Cup ndash the trophy that the winner of UEFA EURO  will receive ndash as the giant screens behind him confirmed he would be the Official Music Artist of next yearrsquos tournament.:Watch: All goals and extended highlights from Scotland - San Marino at HampdenThe song will be revealed in spring  ndash and so too a collaboration with a singer.

But Super Saturday turned into Stupefying Saturday as, once again, Parliament opted for delay. Only this time the delay wasnt led by opponents of Brexit, or even the DUP, but by those  or so Tory rebels, the ldquoGaukward Squad led, by the former Tory minister, David Gauke MP, who back it.They decided that, even though they support Boris Johnsons dealthey were damnedthey were going to vote for it. So they erected another procedural roadblock. The Letwin Amendment was ostensibly to prevent a No Deal Brexit by reinforcing the Benn Act. But its effect is to build in yet more delay to this interminable process..As MPs shambled out of the chamber it was unclear whether or not Boris Johnson was going send the Benn Act letter requesting a further extension of British membership of the EU. Or whether the Speaker John Bercow was going to send it. Or some judge under Nobile Officium. But the whole exercise is pointless anyway. The Prime Minister made clear at the Dispatch Box that, letter or no, he is not going to ldquonegotiate a delay.:Theres a real chance the Scottish courts will have to interveneThis means he will refuse to cooperate with any prolongation, which had anyway been ldquoruled out by the President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, on Thursday. Juncker emphatically did say precisely this, despite claims to the contrary. Of course, the President can be over-ruled by the  heads of government. But Brussels patience has been sorely tested.Last week, Boris Johnson won what must surely be the final concessions from the European Union. He got Brussels to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement, abandon the Irish Backstop, and agree to dual customs arrangements at the Irish border. None of us thought this possible only fortnight ago.Opposition MPs didnt just say that Boris Johnson could never get a deal, they accused him of actively working against one. The negotiations were a ldquosham according to Jeremy Corbyn. Labour MPs said Boris Johnson was in the pay of hedge fund billionaires, whod ordered him to secure a No Deal Brexit, so that they could make a killing on October .On the Tory side, Amber Rudd, the former pensions secretary, resigned from the Cabinet last month claiming that the PM wasnt even trying to get a deal. The Tory MP, Nick Boles, resigned the party whip accusing Johnson of turning the Conservatives into a ldquohard right English Nationalist Party.To be fair, Boles paid fulsome tribute last week to the PMs negotiating skills and admitted he had been wrong. But he still voted against him on Saturday. Another cabinet rebel, Rory Stewart, said thatthe PM got a deal, he would ldquoget down on my knees before Boris Johnson and admit I was wrong. That has yet to happen.Yet, whatever you think of Boris Johnsonrsquos new deal, it undoubtedly is one. Last week, he turned the Irish Backstop back to front. Theresa Mays protocol would have kept the entire UK in the single market and customs union indefinitely. Now only Northern Ireland is in the single market, and the arrangement is time-limited. The protocol is a frontstop, and will only continue with the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly. No longer is there ldquoregulation without representation in the province.Further, Northern Ireland remains in the customs territory of the UK, yet there will be no hard border on Ireland. Goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU tarfs, but onlythere is a ldquorisk that the goods will go on to the European Union through the non-existent Irish border. The UK will police the border at Stranraer, under a joint EU UK committee.:Leadsom and Rees-Mogg abused by demo crowdLabour are right to say that the Johnson deal waters down commitments on workers rights and the environment. The ldquolevel playing field on standards will be negotiated as part of the future trading relationship, rather than as a legally-binding condition of the Withdrawal Deal. But that is pretty much inevitable, since the UK is leaving the European Union, and therefore cannot reasonably remain under its jurisdiction.However, this allowed Labour and the SNP to reject the deal on the grounds that Johnson was planning a ldquorace to the bottom on regulation and workplace standards. But Im not sure it is reasonable to assume that. Theres no reason to suppose that the UK Parliament will impose worse standards than those of the EU. The Tories wont be in power for ever.Of course, Johnson made further concessions. He now accepts at least some customs checks in the Irish Sea. He dumped the Democratic Unionist Partys veto on future arrangements, in place of consent by a simple majority in the Northern Irish Assembly. It was odd to hear some Labour MPs siding with the DUP on consent, when previously theyd accused Boris Johnson of being in Arlene Fosters pocket.The opposition also found themselves son the wrong side of the European Union. Brussels really wants this deal. What was remarkable about the optics of last weeks EC summit was the back-slapping bonhomie with which Boris Johnson was greeted by the EU heads of state.Not long ago, Brussels regarded Boris Johnson as a monster ndash a populist, ultra-Brexiteer, who could not be trusted. He was consigned to that ldquospecial place in hell that the EC President Donald Tusk said was reserved for ldquonationalist politicians like him. Yet last week it was all smiles and fist bumps.But that all seems academic now. We are back in Brexit purgatory after another  dawn. The problem is that the opposition parties cannot agree on what they want, and will only insist on what they dont want.Despite the huge demonstration in London in favour of a Peoples Vote, Remain MPs didnt even try to secure a vote on a repeat referendum on Saturday. Nor will Parliament ever vote to Revoke Article .Even the  Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who wrote to Brussels urging the EU to agree a deal with Boris Johnson, ended up voting against. Numerous Tory MPs who broadly support the deal, like Ken Clarke, cant get in line. Everyone wants something that they cant have.There will now be further procedural wrangling and wriggling this week, as the Government tries to get another meaningful vote tomorrow and a second reading of the Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday. On paper, the votes should be there,the Tory rebels relent and Labour Brexiteers vote for the deal.But votes alone have never been enough to get Brexit over the line. This affair has now gone beyond politics and turned into a kind of psychological condition.

developed at the University of Cambridge which mimics photosynthesis, the process plants use to gather energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water.At present, a gas known as syngas is produced from fossil fuels, but the new carbon-neutral solution that has been drawn up by scientists could eventually be used to develop a sustainable liquid fuel alternative to petrol.Professor Erwin Reisner and his team have managed to ensure the device does not release any additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.ldquoYou may not have heard of syngas itself, but every day you consume products that were created using it, explained Professor Reisner, from Cambridgersquos Department of Chemistry, a senior author of the research.ldquoBeing able to produce it sustainably would be a critical step in closing the global carbon cycle and establishing a sustainable chemical and fuel industry.The generating capacity of photosynthesis is huge.It is thought that the average rate of energy capture through the process globally is approximately  terawatts.This is roughly eight times the current power consumption of the worlds human population.Scientists say they have managed to make their articial leaf sustainable unlike others in the past because of the combination of materials and catalysts they used.The overall process is achieved using two light absorbers, similar to the molecules in plants that harvest sunlight, which are combined with a catalyst made from cobalt.When in water, one light absorber uses the catalyst to produce oxygen, while the other carries out the chemical reaction that reduces carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, forming the syngas mixture.What is more, the articial leaf is able to work just as well on cloudy and overcast days.ldquoThis means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months, said Virgil Andrei, a PhD student and first author of the paper, published in the Nature Materials journal.ldquoYou could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.He added: ldquoWe are aiming at sustainably creating products such as ethanol, which can readily be used as a fuel.ldquoItrsquos challenging to produce it in one step from sunlight using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.ldquoBut we are confident that we are going in the right direction, and that we have the right catalysts, so we believe we will be able to produce a device that can demonstrate this process in the near future.Professor Reisner continued: ldquoWhat wersquod like to do next, instead of first making syngas and then converting it into liquid fuel, is to make the liquid fuel in one step from carbon dioxide and water.ldquoThere is a major demand for liquid fuels to power heavy transport, shipping and aviation sustainably.The development of the articial leaf at Cambridge University comes after it was reported previously that scientists were attempting to mimic the way plants harness energy from the sun in order to make a more efficient renewable fuel.Researchers at the University of East Angliaembarked on an pound, project to replicate photosynthesis.Scientists said the process would be used to create hydrogen, which can be used as a zero-emission fuel for cars, or converted into green electricity.It is hoped the method, which involves placing tiny solar  on microbes to harness sunlight and drive the production of hydrogen, will be a more efficient way of converting the suns energy than currently exists.The UEA, who is leading the project, said: \"Reserves of fossil fuels are dwindling and fuel prices are rising, so its really vital that we look to renewable energy supplies.\"Many renewable energy supplies such as

My we saidI put the tub in the blue bin Irsquod be doing more environmental harm than good as it could prevent the rest of the rubbish being recycled. I saidthe tub didnrsquot go in the blue bin then shersquod be doing environmental harm as it would end up in landfill.Thus ensued an argument about what could and couldnrsquot be recycled. I thought nearly everything could, my we said very little could. \"Glasgow City Council couldnrsquot be so useless that theyrsquod give us a recycling bin but you canrsquot put a butter tub in it,\" I said. \"Surely, Scotland isnrsquot that rubbish at rubbish \"\"Go and check then,\" my we said. So I did. And she was right.I think - rather, I thought - of myself as pretty smart when it comes to green issues. But Irsquom not. I took for granted that the state had started thinking sensibly about the environment, and thatrsquos allowed me to abnegate a lot of responsibility. My newly discovered ignorance has opened my eyes.I checked with Glasgow City Council and found out that indeed I couldnrsquot put a lot of plastics in the blue bin. No plastic bags, nothing like yoghurt pots and butter tubs, can be recycled. The plastics you can put in the blue bin are plastic drink bottles, sauce bottles, bottles for shampoo and cleaning products. Most other plastic materials like food cartons, tetra packs, or wrappings - they go in your general green bin and head to landfill.This canrsquot be good, I thought. Trash I believed should be recycled is actually going to landfill. And Irsquom putting the wrong rubbish in the wrong bin and messing up the recycling system. How many people are making the same mistakes  How does this affect Scotlandrsquos record on recycling So I got hold of the latest figures from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency on household waste, how much is generated, and how itrsquos managed. The figures are for . As a whole Scotland generated . million tonnes of household waste. We recycled . million tonnes - thatrsquos .%. In the era of climate crisis and increased public concern over the environment, thatrsquos pretty poor.I live right on the boundary between East Renfrewshire Council and Glasgow Council, but Glasgow is my local authority. East Renfrewshire generated , tonnes, and recycled , tonnes or .%. Glasgow generated , but recycled just , - thatrsquos only .%. The worst local authority is Shetland - it generates , and recycles  or .%. East Renfrewshire is the best in the country, followed by West Lothian.To make matters worse, rsquos figures are a decline on the previous year. In , Scotland recycled .%. Glasgow recycled .% last year. East Renfrewshire recycled .%.Like most families, we try to recycle as much as we can - we compost food waste, we never use plastic bags. But the system is confusing. It seems the more the public tries to be green, the less impact wersquore having and the worse the state does to match our efforts.I spoke to the Scottish government and was told everyone has ldquoto play their part, ldquoreducing waste is important, families need ldquoto think about what more they can do, that the government ldquowill do our bit to pick up the pace of progress. The country exceeds ldquothe EU target set for  relating to biodegradable municipal waste. Itrsquos also ldquogood news that wersquore generating less household waste than before, and that combined we recycle and compost more than we landfill.Still, it all felt a bit amorphous, so I tried local government. One senior staffer working on the environment said privately, \"Itrsquos definitely not good.\" Glasgow City Council said that although therersquos been an ldquooverall drop in national recycling rates, the local authority ldquofully accepts that improving the cityrsquos recycling performance has been challenging.To be fair to the council, itrsquos replacing , old steel bins across the city, and thatrsquos seen an increase in recycling of % at homes with new blue bins. However, a simple public information programme would be a quick fix ndash telling idiots like me exactly what can and canrsquot be recycled. Email it to residents. Put the information on all new bins.Glasgow Council, however, also pointed to one of the key problems: the business model behind the recycling industry. The council is ldquofinding that the marketplace for recyclable material is increasingly testing.What goes in your blue bin really depends on the market. If therersquos a market to recycle something then it will get recycled. If not, itrsquoll more than likely end up in landfill. Some % of UK councils say theyrsquove experienced problems with the plastics market.Those plastic drinks bottles  Well, therersquos a market for them. Only a fraction of plastic pots, tubs and trays have an end market, however, according to analysis by Recoup, the recycling charity.The market must not be allowed to dictate recycling policy. The state either needs to intervene to provide adequate recycling facilities, or enter into discussions with the industry to improve the service given to the public. Retailers and producers should also bear responsibility -they create waste, they need to help clean it up.However, the pubic also needs reminded that there are reasonable limits to what the market can do as well. Councils complain thatwe put rubbish in recycling with food on it, then wersquore wasting our time. Recycling systems canrsquot handle it, so plastic with food waste - like the wrong plastic in the blue bin - could be rejected.The problem is communication. No-one is talking properly to each other - public, councils, business, and government. We need information on what the market can do, the state must fill in the gaps, and the public needs clear advice. That way we can all play our part, the environment will be prioritised, and families wonrsquot end up at war over recycling a butter tub.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-meghans-interview-shows-okay-not-okay","story":"ldquoWould it be fair to say that things are not really okay, things have been a struggle  he asked during the Sunday-night documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey. ldquoYes, she almost whispered back, her face screaming ldquoand then some.Good for her. Having a child has got to be one of the hardest things a woman will ever do, with the hormone-ravaged reality of le with a newborn baby falling well short of the socially constructed vision of bliss we are led to expect. Far from basking in the love-soaked afterglow we are told comes hand in hand with the creation of a new le, most new mothers struggle with the impact having a child has on their mental health. The fact so few of us feel able to talk about it until we are well and truly back on an even keel only serves to make things worse.But while coping with the reality of le with a new baby is hard enough at the best of times, doing it under the watchful gaze of a tabloid press pack that has turned against you, that wilfully pours scorn on every word you say and every move you make, has got to be a whole lot worse. That Ms Markle, who said in the programme that she had recently tried but failed to adopt a ldquoBritish stf upper lip, found the courage to speak out at all is nothing short of remarkable.Only, somewhat predictably, not everyone seemed to think so, with the fact that Ms Marklersquos already privileged le became even more gilded thanks to her marriage to Prince Harry apparently meaning she should no longer be party to human feelings.ldquoI donrsquot want to hear another word about Meghanldquostruggles, railed Thecolumnist Allison Pearson, adding that as ldquoso many young mums are genuinely struggling - too much work, guilt, costly childcare, credit card debt it is ldquotactless and unfeeling for a Royal with ldquoboundless wealth, beauty, staff at her beck and call to complain. Because wealth, beauty and a gaggle of well-trained nannies is all it takes to secure a personrsquos emotional well-being, of course.Though Ms Pearsonrsquos words were roundly criticised by many of her followers on social media, not everyone disagreed, with narcissism and a lack of self-awareness just two of the charges that were levelled at the young royal. Such attitudes are unfortunately nothing new, with the mistaken idea that the rich are insulated from pain and suffering by the mere fact of their wealth proving to be a common one.:The way Meghan Markle is treated says much about BritainOnly last monthhad to apologise after running an editorial suggesting that the grief former Prime Minister David Cameron felt on the death of his disabled son Ivan was somehow tempered by the fact he had led a privileged le that his pain was made easier due to his wealth and position. Mr Cameron, the paper said, ldquohas known pain and failure in his le but it has always been limited failure and privileged pain, the death of his child seemingly made easier for him because he had been cared for in ldquothe better ing and better funded parts of the NHS.Though the publication later conceded that the attack ldquofell far short of our standards, the idea that it would be more tolerable to watch your child die on a well-staffed ward than on a cash-strapped one is as ludicrous as to suppose an army of nannies can somehow make the post-natal experience an easier one.It is certainly true that a lack of cash can make problems with mental health worse, with the charity Mind making the point that just as poor mental health can make managing money harder, so too worrying about money can make poor mental health worse. But there is nothing to suggest the opposite is true that having no money worries can make poor mental health better or that living a le steeped in privilege can make you immune from mental health issues in the first place.It has become more common in recent years for people with a public profile to speak openly about their experiences of mental health, with Prince Harry himself talking often of the struggles he has faced since losing his mother while still a child. Having spoken about the counselling he received after fearing a complete breakdown in his late s, Harry told Tom Bradbury in Sunday nightrsquos programme that he still does not feel he is out of the woods and that his mental health is something he feels he has to constantly manage.The truth is that there is nothing on earth that can prepare a woman for the emotional impact that giving birth has, with even those who, like Meghan Markle, appear to have it all likely to be hit. After nine months of waiting, planning, blooming, there you are - breasts leaking, body aching - wondering why, when the very thing you wanted is in your arms, all you feel capable of doing is crying.For too long women have been conditioned to hide that reality to straighten their hair, put on their lipstick and get out there with their babies pretending everything is alright to, as some might have it, adopt a stf upper lip. We need to stop that, though, because, as Meghan Markle told ITV News, ldquowhat that does internally is really damaging.In conceding that things have not been easy, that le has been a struggle since she gave birth to baby Archie in May, Ms Markle will have given more women the courage to admit that le with a newborn can be unimaginably tough. We should thank her for it, because while many of us know that itrsquos okay not to be okay after the birth of a child there are still too few visible women willing to take the risk of standing up and saying so. Having that  and choosing to use it is where Meghan Marklersquos true privilege lies."},{"url":null,"title":"prince-wales-arrives-japan-emperors-enthronement","story":"Charles has undertaken the

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmOrkney and Shetland MP, Alistair Carmichael, has raised concerns in the House of Commons about the creation of a border in the Irish Sea under the UK government’s new Brexit plan.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-. Of the ship#s  crew members — many of whom were very young men —  were lost.For more coverage of the events taking place around the anniversary of the sinking of the ship, see this Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Russian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back  miles from the border.Then at the end of the  hours, Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile wide strip of the border.The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish population.Russian and Turkish officials did not immediately say what the arrangement would be around Qamishli.ldquoI believe that this agreement will start a new era toward Syriarsquos lasting stability and it being cleared of terrorism.ldquoI hope that this agreement is beneficial to our countries and to our brothers in Syria, Mr Erdogan said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"US defence secretary Mark Esper--Turkey will keep control of the section in the centre of the border that it captured in its invasion that began on October .That is the territory that Kurdish fighters withdrew from under the US-brokered ceasefire.It extends roughly  miles wide and  miles deep between the Syrian border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.A senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, confirmed his forces had entirely left that area.But he said Turkish troops and their allies were continuing military operations in northeastern Syria outside that withdrawal zone.The Kurdish-led forces notied the White House of the completed withdrawal in a letter, a senior Trump administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the contents of the letter.After the US announced its pullout earlier this month, Turkey launched its invasion, saying it wanted to carve out a safe zone cleared of Kurdish fighters whom it considers terrorists.Turkey also plans to settle many of the . million Syrian refugees on its soil in that zone, which is the heartland of Syriarsquos Kurdish minority.For the Kurds, a Turkish takeover would mean the crushing of the self-rule they have carved out in the northeast amid Syriarsquos civil war.They also fear massive demographic change, as Kurdish civilians flee Turkish control and mainly Arab Syrian refugees move in. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands--The new agreement aims to ease those fears by giving Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, control over much of the area, with the Turkish patrols limited to closer to the border.That may prevent a massive flight of civilians but would be a heavy blow to Kurdish autonomy dreams.The Russia-Turkey deal goes a considerable way to restoring the control of Moscowrsquos ally, the Syrian government, across much of the northeast.Syrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to reunite all the territory under Damascusrsquo rule.On Tuesday, Mr Assad said he was ready to support any ldquopopular resistance against Turkeyrsquos invasion.Mr Erdogan is ldquoa thief, Mr Assad told troops during a visit to the northwestern province of Idlib.ldquoHe stole the factories and the wheat and the oil in cooperation with Daeshand now is stealing the land.ldquoWe are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later, Mr Assad said.Mr Assadrsquos visit to Idlib underlined Damascusrsquo goal of regaining the border.Idlib is adjacent to a border enclave that Turkey captured several years ago in another incursion.Turkey also has observation points inside Idlib, negotiated with Russia, to monitor a ceasefire there between the government and opposition fighters and jihadi groups.He said his government had offered clemency to Kurdish fighters, whom it considers separatists, to ldquoensure that everyone is ready to resist the aggression and fight the Turkish assault.Syrian state media reported, meanwhile, that government forces entered new areas in Hassakeh province at the far eastern end of the border, under the arrangement with the Kurds.copy -.

Targeting public transport is ideologically nonsensical but to do it at a time when irritable commuters are trying to make their way across heaving s is akin to having a death wish. Which is not to suggest the way the mob turned against the man standing on top of the train was acceptable merely that it could have been predicted by anyone who has spent time on the London Underground at rush hour.The misjudgment alienated workers who might in other, less volatile circumstances have been interested in a discussion about climate change. But it also allowed those right-wing commentators – the Brendan O’Neills and the Toby Youngs – to build on existing tropes of the campaigners as too middle class, too “elitist” and too extreme. The spectacle of the likes of Times columnist and Brexiteer Iain Martin positioning himself as the defender of “working class cleaners” would be hilariousit wasn’t so depressing. But these labels stick, especiallythe targets are stupid enough to engage in behaviour which perpetuates them. It’s dficult enough to take on governments and global corporations without handing their smirking henchmen the weapons with which to shoot you.Though the Canning Town protest brought matters to a dramatic head, criticism of the movement – its lack of a coherent ideology or strategy, its insensitivity to race and class issues its “the end of the world is nigh” catastrophising – have been a source of internal and external friction for a while.Extinction Rebellionhas been influenced by political scientist Erica Chenoweth who says . per cent of a population must take part in a campaign of civil disobedience to guarantee political change. In order to attract that . per cent, the movement has to be inclusive. However,you embrace a large cross-section – rich and poor, young and old, people from all ethnicities and political perspectives – it’s unrealistic to expect their views on causes, priorities or tactics to be aligned.There are many obvious fault lines in XR. There is the ide between those in the global north – where we are being urged to “think of the children” – and the global south, where the poorest are already directly being impacted by floods. There is a ide between those who can afford to pay a carbon tax on flights and those for whom it might mean the loss of their once-a-year package holiday.And then there is the ide between left and right between those anti-capitalists who would once have been in Occupy and “Malthusians” – like Rupert Read – who want to rein in large-scale immigration. The extent to which this obliviousness to potential “othering” has the capacity to damage XR can be seen in the furore over the flowers left for the police officers at Brixton Police station. It takes a gag-inducing dollop of white privilege not to associate Brixton Police station with the oppression of black communities or to understand that praising officers for their “decency and professionalism” might be considered offensive.The kind of climate change deniers who tweeted: “Please not Greta Thunberg” on the day the Nobel Peace Prize was due to be announced have already branded XR a Doomsday Cult. I would argue you can’t be a Doomsday “cultist” when the Doomsday scenario is rooted in science. But again XR sometimes behaves in a way that encourages this interpretation. It doesn’t help that co-founder Gail Bradbrook’s world view altered after she took mind-bending drugs on a retreat in Costa Rica. Nor that some of those involved are so Biblical in their presentation of future destruction. When Bradbrook declares  per cent of species will be dead within her daughter’s letime unless we all stop producing CO by , she sounds more like a wild-eyed prophet than a credible campaigner.This matters a lot. If the complaint about climate change deniers is they ignore science, then XR has to be rigorous in sticking to the facts. It should base its statements on demonstrable truths – the destruction of our coral reefs, rising sea water levels, plummeting insect numbers. And its demands should be realistic. If it is feasible to ask the UK to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by , fair enough, Butit is not – and many experts believe it isn’t – then they should focus on what can be achieved. Pushing for too much, too quickly is only going to wind up potential sympathisers.Talking of winding people up, XR leaders should use the tube station disaster as “a learning opportunity”. Civil disobedience is an important tool. It can raise awareness. It can force the hands of governments. But the targets have to be carefully chosen. Not the London underground. Or the BBC which – despite sometimes giving climate change deniers a  – devotes time to reporting the impact of extreme weather conditions.Those organising the protests ought to be mindful of workers’ routines and a balance ought to be struck between causing enough of a disturbance to make an impact and so great a disturbance it threatens livelihoods. And use some imagination. If you want to target public transport, don’t bring it to a standstill, forcing more people to use their cars make some statement about its cost or inefficiency. Alongside the civil disobedience, the movement would gain from demonstrating some grasp of the complexity of climate change: the way it intersects with capitalism and class and how –we do not guard against it – the solutions may entrench inequality rather than reverse it.Extinction Rebellion is right in principle. Climate change is the most important issue of our time. The consequences of not acting quickly enough will be seismic. It is not true, as Thunberg has implied, that governments are doing nothing but they are not doing nearly enough.To force them to change their ways requires a massive, but also a measured response. Martin Luther King – the inspiration behind much of XR’s thinking – orchestrated bus boycotts and marches. But he retained enough establishment respect to be accepted into the White House to talk to JFK and Lyndon B Johnson at least until the Civil Rights Act was signed into law. At the moment, the movement is making le easy for those naysayers who criticise XR’s tactics not because they have better ones, but because they want to push climate change off the agenda.If Extinction Rebellion wants to be taken seriously, it needs to be less scatter-gun. It needs to rein in its renegades and rid itself of racists who see those in the global south as “the problem” rather than as victims of colonialism. Saving the world is a lofty aim, but it won’t be achieved by alienating all those whose co-operation is neededthings are to change. It will be done by creating a consensus by persuading as many people as possible that radical, systemic change is not just desirable, but imperative.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch snp must back labour s brexit vote plan","story":"Keir Starmer#s is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and Sturgeon should follow, writes Lesley Riddoch.Never mind the provocative bluster from Boris Johnson’s hollow frontmen and women, there is no disguising the signicance of the Tories’ weekend defeat. Of course, many predict rebel Conservatives will nowto the fold, able to support the Johnson deal since the Letwin amendment ensures it cannot be “accidentally” dropped, talked out or stalled before  October. But Tory Remainers will soon face another testing option – putting the withdrawal deal to the people in a second Deal v Remain European referendum. It looks increasingly that this is the only constructive and democratic way out of the Brexit stalemate, and the option’s current traction owes a lot to the growing status of Keir Starmer.: Ian Blackford: Boris Johnson not treating office of PM with any respectThe shadow Brexit secretary followed an impressive Commons speech on Saturday with a categorical assurance on yesterday’s Andrew Marr Show that Labour will back an amendment calling for a referendum on Johnson’s Brexit deal, perhaps as early as tomorrow. No s or buts. No self-defeating subclauses or bizarre contradictions. : MSPs on course to back laws for quickfire Scottish independence voteClear, comprehensible and conclusive. Hardly Labour-like at all.And bold, leaving Britain open to the great risk of a second Leave vote – a result that would then be impossible to sidestep or deny. A game-changer But the plan has just as big an upside – it’s as bold as the disruptive and eye-catching strategy of one Boris Johnson.Could this be the game-changer that finally unites the opposition around a single Remain plan  Will Jeremy Corbyn back a colleague who’s widely and openly being touted as the next leader of the Labour Party  And will the SNP follow suit  Strangely enough – even on the fractious left – the answer to both questions could finally be yes.The stock of Starmer, former director of public prosecutions, has been rising quietly throughout the Brexit debacle but his Commons speech on “super Saturday” was as succinct and punchy as Corbyn contributions are generally “nuanced” and stumbling.Historian Simon Schama tweeted: “Keir Starmer has actually READ the proposed agreement in crucial detail and thought deeply and forensically about it – and then argues responsibly from that detail. Brilliant, but makes everyone WISH he were leader.”Such open praise and longing for change at the top would be enough to send a younger rival packing,Labour had a petty, self-opinionated leader. But while Corbyn may have many faults, personal envy doesn’t seem to be one of them. Indeed Starmer’s success actually reflects very well on the man who appointed him. As one supporter tweeted: “Corbyn runs a team, takes a backseat when needed and lets his star members shine. Other leaders demand the spotlight, refuse to delegate and fail. It’s no coincidence he’s seen out two Tory PMs.”Jeremy CorbynBut is the Brexit-leaning Labour leader smart enough to back Starmer instead of overriding him  A second referendum call has the benefit of being a relatively quick manoeuvre, not requiring a Labour election win, and helpfully separating the party from its own crazy plan to renegotiate Brexit but then campaign against its own new deal in a second referendum. Supporting Johnson’s deal would placate Brexit supporters and the “just get it over with” brigade, while also delighting Remain voters with the possibility that the attached second vote might dump Brexit altogether.Indeed the only thing wrong with Starmer’s second referendum plan is that it opens Labour up to the accusation of being feart – failing to propose a vote of no confidence and a general election, even though the next EU extension will certainly end the danger of a no-deal Brexit. So will Corbyn back a confirmatory referendum on Johnson’s deal  He might,other parties back the move. It’s rumoured high-profile Tories such as Amber Rudd now accept there’s no other way to break the deadlock. Will she and other rebels openly back a second referenduma suitably neutral backbencher champions the cause  Starmer even hopes to coax the DUP on board. Good luck with that. But what about the most important block of votes – the SNP. Is it ready to play ball Backing the wrong horseSpeaking on Sunday Politics Scotland, Ian Blackford wouldn’t commit the SNP to following Labour’s lead and talked instead of another court case or a vote of no confidence. It seems a strangely wooden response to a fluid situation and leaving the SNP in danger of backing the wrong horse tomorrow. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that the path to a second vote will be rockier than anyone appreciates. Certainly,the amendment passes, it’s not clear how a second vote will be organised. Can Johnson really be expected to produce a fair, timeous, workable referendum he doesn’t want to hold  The childish, churlish clutch of letters sent to the EU this weekend shows how grudging he can be. That’s why many MPs believe a “government of national unity”is the only way to deliver a second vote that resolves the Brexit process once and for all. SNP MP Joanna Cherry believes such a scenario is the best chance of winning a Section  order – which would allow the Scottish Parliament to hold a legally binding second independence referendum – not just because the SNP would be in a bargaining position but also because democrats from other parties would find it hard to deny the inconsistency in their current second vote positions.There’s also clear popular support amongst Scottish voters for a pan-UK second vote to end the EU withdrawal deadlock. A new Panelbase poll found that only  per cent supported a general election - Nicola Sturgeon’s current stance - while  per cent would prefer another referendum.  per cent were don’t knows.Of course, the SNP may worry that a confirmatory referendum on Brexit sets a dficult precedent for indyref. It might, but we are where we are – perhaps about to find a democratic solution for a stalemate which might otherwise hand the next general election to Johnson on a plate. It’s also hoped the end of the Union will be more of a “conscious uncoupling” than a Brexit-style bust-up. Talks with opposition MPs in Scotland and London have been progressing quietly, aided by joint working over Brexit. Starting the indyref project in a collaborative, non-confrontational way allows the slender hope that constitutional change in Scotland will not be conducted with the high-handedness of the Conservatives’ Brexit.So all eyes will be on the backbenches tomorrow.If a well respected figure allows Labour to push for a second vote, and the SNP, Liberal Democrats and some Tory rebels follow suit, Britain’s constitutional logjam could be released far more quickly than anyone imagines. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"SNP Deputy leader Keith Brown insisted a growing number of Scots are ready to listen to the \"progressive case\" for independence, but pro-union leaders say the Yes campaign is losing support.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed up former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed  Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking \"complete\" support for staying in the UK, while  was \"complete\" support for independence.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich.

The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Their mother Emma, who was found straying by local authorities, gave birth to the  puppies shortly after arriving at the Rehoming Centre.The puppies, named after popular award-winning actors and actresses, are now more than eight weeks old and canine carers at the busy Rehoming Centre have been working hard to get them prepared for their potential new owners. The puppies currently available for adoption are named: Emmy, Brando, Legend, Jolie, Heath, Goldberg and Leonardo.Oonagh Phillips, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, said: “The Rehoming Centre is no stranger to puppy residents however, we do find that Lurcher puppies tend to stay with us a bit longer.

Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog.

But for every bad news story about young people, there are so many more good news stories with many youngsters going above and beyond for the great of their own community.One such example is a group of girls from New Lodge Youth Centre who have recently embarked on an intergenerational project with elderly people in local nursing homes and accommodated living.An intergenerational project is one designed to help build better relationships between young and old people as well as tackle issues such as bullying and bereavement.The project also creates learning opportunities for the pupils and the elderly, with young people working one-on-one with seniors and asking questions about their childhood, work, hobbies and le in general.Paul Dynes from New Lodge Youth Centre said the intergenerational project came about thanks to their great relationship with Newington Housing Association.“Basically, the project came about after work between the youth centre and Martin Hamilton from Newington Housing Association, who use our building for ious events,” he said. “They have also provided us with support for ious programmes over the last couple of years. From our work together, it sparked an idea of doing some more things together. It was actually a group of young girls that came to one of our youth workers to express a real interest and want to engage with an elderly home or accommodated living or. as it is better known, some sort of intergenerational project.”The project is now in full swing with the girls spending a couple of hours each week engaging with the elderly.“The first session was all about storytelling, sharing experiences and memories before it progressed to taking part in games and activities to spark such conversations between them,” added Paul.“They were able to build up relationships with each other and started to understand more about each other which was key to the rest of the project. Since then, they have done all sorts of things together such as baking and other fun-based activities.“They have recently decided to go on to do a shared-art piece where they will create fashionable dresses to show the evolution of fashion over the years to the modern day.”Paul is now hopeful the project will be something other communities can take note of in order to break the stigma of some young people and elderly folk’s opinions of each other.“I think the bigger issue is that some young people may have views on elderly people and vice-versa.“Some young people get a bad name by causing trouble or engaging in anti-social behaviour and this type of project helps create an understanding of one another.“There is definitely a need for it within our community and indeed, in the wider society.“If there are people and groups who want to make it happen, it certainly can.“I would like to thank Martin Hamilton , James Begleyand everyone at New Lodge Arts and the Ashton Centre for their work and help in making the project happen.”To get involved with New Lodge Youth Centre, contact   "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38618248.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/nt%20in%20Belfast%20010.jpg","title":"alex kane stormont was messy it looked sneaky and it might just have ended up making a difficult situation much much worse","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He refused to be drawn into a \"my legal advice is better than your legal advice\" dispute. He also rejected one point of order after another.That cant have been easy for him. He has been a member of the DUP for around  years and is close to many of their MLAs. He knew how much he was angering them: it was obvious from both their faces and their body language.He knew the scale of the potential damage he was doing to his standing and reputation within the party. He knew how much damage he was probably doing to relationships within his Church.He knew that elements of the party and its wider voting base would hold him personally responsible for the introduction of new abortion regulations to Northern Ireland. So, it is a credit to him that he stood his ground.There is another point worth noting: the lack of any attempt to continue the prohibition on same-sex-marriage.The DUP made a very serious, thought-through, bold attempt yesterday to continue the prohibition on abortion, yet not a single word on same-sex-marriage.Had the party made a calculation that it would go for just one issue   Or had it deliberately left same-sex-marriage untouched, hoping to offer it as a peace offering something it was finally prepared to live with  Slipping it through the net, in other words.Putting it bluntly: DUP voters are far more concerned about abortion than same-sex marriage.The DUP also needed a huge distraction at next Saturdays annual conference from its fall-out with Boris Johnson and growing grassroots rumblings over new borders and possible \"constitutional slippage\".Abortion is a big issue for the grassroots and Foster needed to look as though she had made a serious effort to stop the changes.But quite why she couldnt have pushed for the recall a few weeks ago is beyond me. Indeed, the recall petition wasnt even kick-started by the DUP, but by Baroness OLoan and the Both Lives Matter campaign.There was more than a touch of farce and chaos about yesterdays events and it was dficult to avoid the conclusion that the partywas acting on the hoof.The outcome is far from ideal, but at least the DUP can go into the election - which is probably only weeks away - claiming to have tried and then blaming Newton, the SDLP and anyone  it can think of for putting up obstacles.Yesterday was messy. It also looked sneaky. I can understand the concerns that extending abortion regulations to Northern Irelandraise for hundreds of thousands of people, but this was never the best way of addressing those concerns. Indeed, it might simply have ended up making a dficult situation very much worse.Anyway, Im not even certain that a Bill smuggled through in those circumstances would, in fact, have received Royal Assent.Yesterdays events have also probably made it a little bit more dficult to fully reboot the Assembly.A couple of weeks ago, that probably wouldnt have bothered the DUP too much, for it was still in a fairly cosy relationship with the Conservatives.But now  It was a quasi form of direct rule which led to the changes in abortion and same-sex-marriage regulations at midnight.If the Secretary of State concludes that devolution is unlikely anytime soon, he may also conclude that full-throttle direct rule cannot be avoided. That, I think, would hurt unionism far more that nationalism.For all sorts of reasons, it was a bad day for the Assembly and a bad day for Northern Ireland. It was a wretched day too for our political parties, who have drted further apart and seem incapable of reaching agreement on anything.Irrespective of where the blame lies, I dont get any sense of the support bases of either the DUP or Sinn Fein egging on their respective leaderships to cut a deal built on compromise. Indeed, their electoral prospects seem to rise the further apart they move.So, the primary lesson to take from yesterday is that the curtain may be about to come down for the final time. This is an Assembly without power, without respect, without support and without the civility and willingness to co-operate, which is essential for progress in Northern Ireland.It cannot get anything done at local level and nor can it prevent decisions being imposed upon us from London.If it has a purpose anymore, I cant for the le of me see what that purpose is."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38621824.ece/9a115/AUTOCROP/w620h342/POLITICS%20372.jpg","title":"brexit mps back deal in principle but refuse fasttrack through commons","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

and Turkey announced an agreement  for their two countries’ forces to jointly patrol almost the entire north-eastern Syrian border after the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters..pushThe deal would seal the two countries’ power in Syria, filling the void left by departing American troops after President Donald Trump abruptly ordered their withdrawal.The announcement came as Kurdish fighters completed their pullout from a section of the Syrian-Turkish border as required by a US-brokered ceasefire that was set to expire on Tuesday night.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A view of the town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, near the Syrian border Together the arrangements transform the map of northeast Syria, leaving Turkey in sole control over one section in the middle of the border, while Turkey, Russia and the Syrian government will have hands in the rest.The deployments replace American soldiers who for five years battled alongside Kurdish-led fighters and succeeded in bringing down the rule of the Islamic State group across a third of Syria at the cost of thousands of Kurdish fighters’ lives.The American pullout has proven chaotic and stumbling.It ran into a new hitch when neighbouring Iraq said Tuesday that the American forces did not have permission to stay on its territory.The Iraqi announcement seemed to contradict US defence secretary Mark Esper, who a day earlier said the forces leaving Syria would deploy in Iraq to fight the so-called Islamic State group.Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey announced their agreement after six hours of talks and poring over maps of Syria at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.Under the -point deal, Kurdish fighters would have  hours starting at noon on Wednesday, meaning, until next Tuesday at pm, to withdraw from the border.I believe that this agreement will start a new era toward Syrias lasting stability and it being cleared of terrorismRecep Tayyip Erdogan, president of TurkeyRussian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back  miles from the border.Then at the end of the  hours, Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile wide strip of the border.The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish population.Russian and Turkish officials did not immediately say what the arrangement would be around Qamishli.“I believe that this agreement will start a new era toward Syria’s lasting stability and it being cleared of terrorism.“I hope that this agreement is beneficial to our countries and to our brothers in Syria,” Mr Erdogan said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  US defence secretary Mark Esper Turkey will keep control of the section in the centre of the border that it captured in its invasion that began on October .That is the territory that Kurdish fighters withdrew from under the US-brokered ceasefire.It extends roughly  miles wide and  miles deep between the Syrian border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.A senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, confirmed his forces had entirely left that area.But he said Turkish troops and their allies were continuing military operations in northeastern Syria outside that withdrawal zone.The Kurdish-led forces notied the White House of the completed withdrawal in a letter, a senior Trump administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the contents of the letter.After the US announced its pullout earlier this month, Turkey launched its invasion, saying it wanted to carve out a safe zone cleared of Kurdish fighters whom it considers terrorists.Turkey also plans to settle many of the . million Syrian refugees on its soil in that zone, which is the heartland of Syria’s Kurdish minority.For the Kurds, a Turkish takeover would mean the crushing of the self-rule they have carved out in the northeast amid Syria’s civil war.They also fear massive demographic change, as Kurdish civilians flee Turkish control and mainly Arab Syrian refugees move in.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands The new agreement aims to ease those fears by giving Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, control over much of the area, with the Turkish patrols limited to closer to the border.That may prevent a massive flight of civilians but would be a heavy blow to Kurdish autonomy dreams.The Russia-Turkey deal goes a considerable way to restoring the control of Moscow’s ally, the Syrian government, across much of the northeast.Syrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to reunite all the territory under Damascus’ rule.On Tuesday, Mr Assad said he was ready to support any “popular resistance” against Turkey’s invasion.Mr Erdogan is “a thief”, Mr Assad told troops during a visit to the northwestern province of Idlib.“He stole the factories and the wheat and the oil in cooperation with Daeshand now is stealing the land.”“We are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later,” Mr Assad said.Mr Assad’s visit to Idlib underlined Damascus’ goal of regaining the border.Idlib is adjacent to a border enclave that Turkey captured several years ago in another incursion.Turkey also has observation points inside Idlib, negotiated with Russia, to monitor a ceasefire there between the government and opposition fighters and jihadi groups.He said his government had offered clemency to Kurdish fighters, whom it considers separatists, to “ensure that everyone is ready to resist the aggression” and fight the Turkish assault.Syrian state media reported, meanwhile, that government forces entered new areas in Hassakeh province at the far eastern end of the border, under the arrangement with the Kurds."},{"url":null,"title":"south pole ozone hole shrinks to smallest size since discovery","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The hole reaches its peak in September and October and disappears by late December until the next spring in the Southern Hemisphere.The  international Montreal Protocol — the only United Nations treaty ratied by every country on Earth — banned many of the chlorine compounds used in refrigerants and aerosols.The ban resulted in a slightly smaller ozone hole in recent years, but this year’s dramatic shrinking is not from those efforts, Mr Newman said.“It’s just a fluke of the weather,” said University of Colorado atmospheric scientist Brian Toon.Chlorine in the air needs cold temperatures in the stratosphere and clouds to convert into a form of the chemical that eats ozone, Mr Newman said. The clouds go away when it warms up.But this September and October, the southern polar vortex — a swirl of cold high-speed winds around the pole — started to break down.At  miles high in the atmosphere, temperatures were C warmer than average. Winds dropped from a normal mph to about mph, Nasa reported.This is something that happens on occasion, occurring in  and , but not this extreme, Mr Newman said."},{"url":null,"title":"trudeau wins second term as premier but canada more divided","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Regardless of how you cast your vote, our team will work hard for all Canadians.— Justin TrudeauOctober , With results still trickling in, the Liberals had  seats —  short of the  needed for a majority in the -seat House of Commons — while the Conservatives had .While Mr Trudeau claimed a mandate, his party won fewer votes nationally than the Conservatives, and failed to win a single seat in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the Conservatives dominated.There is growing outrage in Alberta, home to the third-largest oil reserves in the world, over Mr Trudeau’s inability to get a pipeline built to the Pacic Coast so the province’s oil can command a higher price.“To Canadians in Alberta and Saskatchewan,” he said after his victory, “know that you are an essential part of our great country. I have heard your frustration, and I want to be there to support you. Let us all work hard to bring our country together.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Justin Trudeau and we Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau celebrate in Montreal At the same time, he said Canadians elected a progressive government that will fight climate change. That means he will keep a national carbon tax that has also angered western Canada.In what was supposed to be a concession speech, Mr Scheer said the results showed the PM was much weakened since his  election, when pundits had predicted the beginning of another Trudeau dynasty. Mr Trudeau’s father Pierre was prime minister from  to , apart from a brief interruption in -.“Conservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,” Mr Scheer said. “And Mr Trudeau, when your government falls, Conservatives will be ready, and we will win.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Andrew Scheer Canada was also further ided by the electoral success of the separatist Bloc Quebecois in the French-speaking province of Quebec. The Bloc won  of the province’s  districts, up from .The party did not talk about separatism during the campaign and is not expected to seek a referendum for independence from Canada.Mr Trudeau, , prevailed after a series of scandals that diminished his rock-star appeal from  and tarnished his image as a liberal figurehead.Old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month, and he was also accused of bullying his female attorney general into dropping the prosecution of a Canadian engineering company.Environmentalists have accused him of betrayal for spending billions to buy the pipeline in a so-far unsuccessful bid to get the stalled project moving again. It has been held up by environmental opposition and court challenges.His party is likely to rely on the New Democrats to form a new government and pass legislation. That will further alienate western Canada because New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh is against the pipeline project."},{"url":null,"title":"487990","story":"Scenes at Stormont this week have been branded “farcical” after the first official meeting of MLAs in over  days failed to get off the ground. A last-ditch attempt to block abortion law changes in Northern Ireland led by the DUP failed, with the law changing at midnight on Monday. Unionist parties, who oppose the upcoming liberalisation, triggered the assemblys recall with a signed petition. Members of the SDLP were also in attendance. But Speaker, Robin Newton, informed MLAs that the Assembly had to elect a speaker and deputies with cross community support before any other business could take place. That became impossible when SDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared he wasn’t willing to facilitate a “unionist talking shop” and led his party out of the chamber. As they made their way out cries of “shame” were shouted by DUP MLAs. googletag.cmd.push As a result of their leaving no nationalist representatives remained, meaning no new speaker could be elected and the sitting was suspended after less than an hour. Jim Allister accused the SDLP of thwarting the formation of an Assembly and said they were therefore thwarting legislation to protect the lives of unborn children. The DUP later walked out, vowing that this was not the end of the matter and they would seek to challenge the law. Mrs Foster said it was a shameful day which would leave Northern Ireland with Europes most liberal abortion laws. They were swtly followed by the UUP after Robin Swann labelled the day’s events a “pantomime” and called on the Secretary of State to consider whether there is any future for the NI Assembly. ‘Pantomime’ Some unionist assembly members had been attempting to introduce the Defence of the Unborn Child Bill , which they hoped to pass by midnight. Two members tabled a Private Members’ Bill in an attempt to halt the Westminster legislation decriminalising abortion. DUP MLA Paul Givan argued the point as to why it should happen having sought legal advice from the Attorney General. The DUP leader Arlene Foster implored the Speaker to share his legal advice with MLAs. However, Mr Newton - who was elected as a DUP MLA - resisted attempts to persuade him to suspend assembly rules to allow the bill to be introduced. Legal advice was sought, he said, and he was content with the guidance provided which is “confidential and privileged”. In July, MPs at Westminster passed legislation which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Irelanddevolution is not restored by  October. Mondays sitting was the first time the assembly had sat for nearly three years.

But when Ava arrived at St. Mary’s, teachers encouraged students to study STEM subjects and to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Ava commented: “I realised how technology was the future and is changing the world so I got involved in my chemistry club. Through that I was able to go to competitions each year where I won prizes and got to know so many people who were developing projects that are changing the world.“The science teachers at St. Mary’s have definitely pushed me along the way, they’re so enthusiastic and help me in whatever way they can.”She attends competitions each year such as SciFest, BT Young Scientist in Dublin, the Big Bang in Birmingham and also travelled to Pittsburgh for the Broadcom MASTERS after being selected as one of the top  brightest minds in the world.The -year-old has created her own homemade spectrophotometer, an invention that detects the amount of harmful dyes in soft drinks and sweets.“My spectrophotometer could actually test how much synthetic dye was in soft drinks and sweets. Energy drinks don’t actually say how much dye is in them, and when I was testing the concentration it was very high.“These dyes cause things such as ADHD and cancer because of the benzene and yellow dye. I thoughtthere’s more of this in energy drinks then I’ll find out how muchthe companies aren’t going to advertise it.“I used the same device for another application, to test medications for the amount of active ingredients present. Medications are being sold online which don’t actually have the correct active ingredient but instead contain things like rat poison which makes them extremely dangerous.“By testing them you can make sure they’re safe and helping people as advertised.”It’s Ava’s intention to expand the parameters of its application to include tests for diabetes and water quality which would allow this invention to be utilised in third world countries and medical practices. googletag.cmd.push ‘Spellbound’  One of Ava’s science teachers nominated her for the Ms Monopoly advertisement. Hasbro expressed an interest in Ava’s project and were invested in her personal story.The -year-old was eventually chosen as one of three iniduals around the world to be the face of Ms Monopoly. Hasbro then sent representatives to Ireland to film the advertisement a few weeks ago.Filming took place in a number of locations in Derry and a longer version of this will be aired shortly on the company’s website.In the advertisement Ava says: “Back in the old days women were in the kitchen and looked pretty on the stage but now women and girls are building things so I thought why not be the change that I want to see in the world.”Each of the young women can be seen unwrapping the first edition of the Ms Monopoly board game with their parents, however, unlike the original game theirs comes with pound, in real money to help them bring their inventions to le. It wasn’t rehearsed and captures their genuine surprise. Shock “It was such a shock when I got the email that I was one of three people chosen from millions interviewed around the world.“On the day of filming we had no idea about the huge amount of money I was going to get. They sat us down in the living room and we were all absolutely spellbound by this huge amount of money,” she said.A message inside finishes by saying, “Go girl, be who you are, and bring this world some change.”It is Ava’s intention to follow that advice by taking the science and technology route at A-level and applying for a scholarship at one of the Ivy League universities in the United States.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.” googletag.cmd.push Personal best Despite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”  Marty Gallagher Twenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added. Camaraderie Special club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the façade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in . Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , . He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city. While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War. Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria. The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century. The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour. Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia. Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion. On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation. The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki. On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs. A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man. The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north. The plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft. Another sixty seconds after detonation the northern sec tion of the city was destroyed and , people were killed. Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers. Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage. In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air. “Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation. “We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.” Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war. Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique. Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since . In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki. “After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends! “Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.” The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death. The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until . In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry. His father William, mother Mary who died in  and his brother, also a Presbyterian minister, Rev William Alexander Barker who passed away in  are buried in Derry City Cemetery.\",\"keywords\":\"William,Barker,Derry,City,cemetery,Nagasaki,Bombing\",\"articleSection\":\"Features\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"William Barker was born on August ,  and came from an established old Derry family.

After he trained as an architect and engineer, he was apprenticed to the Derry building firm of George and Robert A. Ferguson. He later set up his own practice in the city and at a young age was responsible for large projects in Omagh, Coleraine and other towns. Amongst the projects he oversaw in his native city were the Corporation waterworks at Creggan and was he was also associated to the layout of Foyle College grounds for building purposes. But amongst Barkers main projects was designing a shirt factory for David Hogg and Charles Mitchell at Sackville Street in Derry. He had also been heavily involved in the project to build the new Presbyterian |Church at Burt, Co Donegal in the mid-s. googletag.cmd.push Constructed in , Hogg  Mitchell’s shirt factory almost immediately won a highly lucrative contract when it became the supplier of shirts for the British Army during the Boer War . The company founded the ‘Old England’ line of shirts which later became the globally known ‘Peter England’ brand. It continued to manufacture shirts in Derry until the s and the faccedilade of Barker’s building still exists today as the building was converted into an apartment block in . Tragedy struck William Barker when in late  he fell off a horse and never recovered consciousness before his death at the young age of  on May , . He left a widow, Maryand three children-Mary Violet Barker, Thomas McCurdy Baker and William Alexander his namesake at his home at Orchard Street in the centre of the city. While William Snr undoubtedly left his professional mark even at such a young age on his native city, it was his son Thomas who lived a truly fascinating le having borne bearing personal witness and suffered as a result of one of the most decisively brutal acts of the Second World War. Thomas McCurdy Barker was born in , was a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin. He was the first full-time secretary of the Irish Christian Movement, the convenor and organiser of the  conference ‘Ireland’s Hope’, the proceedings of which he edited, and from the s a missionary and professor of New Testament Greek at Mukden in the Chinese province of Manchuria. The Second Sino-Japanese War was fought between the Republic of China and The Empire of Japan between July  and September . China fought Japan with the aid of the Soviet Union and the USA, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in  the conflict became immersed in WWII and a result became the largest conflict in Asia during the twentieth century. The war between China and Japan was the result of a decades long Japanese imperialist policy to expand its influence both politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw materials, food and labour. Internecine warfare in China also provided strong opportunities for Japan who viewed Manchuria as almost limitless supply of raw materials, a market fot its manufactured goods and a protective buffer against the Soviet Union in Siberia. Japan invaded Manchuria in September  after what bacame known as the Mukden Incident. It was an event staged by Japanese military personnel as a pretext for a full invasion. On September , Lieutenant Suemori Kawamoto detonated a small quantity of dynamite close to a rail line owned by Japans South Manchuria Railyway near Mukden. The explosion was so weak that it failed to destroy the track, but it was enough to allow the Imperial Japanese Army to accuse Chinese dissident with causing it and as a result they invaded and occupied Manchuria, establishing a puppet state called Manchukuo after five months of incessant fighting. The Japanese even installed Chinas last Emperor, Puyi as the ruler to try and lend legitimacy to thwe situation. The invasion of the whole of China came six years later in July  when Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo Bridge-an access route to Bejing. As the conflict became merged into WWII, the Japanese began imprisoning people in concentration camps and amongst these was Rev Thomas McCurdy Barker who was incarcerated for the duration of the war at Nagasaki. On the day of the U.S nuclear strike on August ,  the population of Nagasaki was estimated to be ,. There were , Japanese residents, , Korean residents, , conscripted Korean workers, , Japanese soldiers,  conscripted Chinese workers and  Allied POWs. A Boeing B- Superfortress plane called Bockscar, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, took off just before dawn carrying a plutonium bomb code named Fat Man. The initial target was the city of Kokura, but it was obscured by cloud and smoke, so the Americans turned their attention to their secondary target-Nagasaki. But, it too was covered by cloud. Running short of fuel, the plane encircled the city several times and it was decided to use radar to drop the device. But, at the last moment the cloud cleared and the bomb was dropped on the citys Urakami Valley-midway between the Mitshubishi Steel and Arms plant in the south and the Mitsubhisi-Urakami Ordnace works in the north. The plane had arrived over Nagasaki at .am and just under a minute after it was released it exploded at .am at an altitude of approximately , ft. Another sixty seconds after detonation the northern sec tion of the city was destroyed and , people were killed. Amongst the casualties were , of the , employees of of the Mitsubhisi arms plant and , more factory workers at ious other sites. These included , Koreans and  Japanese soldiers. Industrial damage at Nagasaki was high and left between -% of industrial production destroyed. The attack came three days after the first nuclear bomb had been dropped on Hiroshoma, but the Nagasaki device was more powerful than the first bomb but because the city was surrounded by hilly terrain there was less damage. In , another Irish prisoner who also witnessed the bombing of Nagasaki. This was Dr Aidan MacCarthy, a medic in the RAF from County Cork who wrote: “Then there followed a blue flash, accompanied by a very bright magnesium-type flare which blinded them. Then came a frighteningly loud by rather flat explosion which was followed by a blast of hot air. “Some of this could be felt even by us as it came through the shelter openings, which were very rarely closed owing to poor ventilation. “We all genuinely thought, for some time, that this was the end of the world.” Amongst his fellow prisoners was a community of Catholic nuns to whom in the absence of a priest Rev McCurdy ministered to every day-an act which was later recognised when he received thanks from Pope Pius XII when he learned of the Derry mans actions after the war. Also there was Ann Barker, the Rev Thomas second we, who as a medical doctor also practised her profession during her imprisonment at Nagasaki. Her expertise is credited with helping her husband continue to live a rich le in his later retirement despite the effects that the bomb had on his physique. Lilian McCombe was a school teacher at the Presbyterian station at Mukden where she had lived and worked since . In  she wrote: “That chapter of my le closed with the attack by Japan on Pearl Harbour on December , . From that date, I with some  other colleagues were under Japanese jurisdiction. The greater part of the intervening years were spent in internment camps in the cities of Kobe and Nagasaki. “After a non-stop voyage of around three weeks via the Pacic Ocean, I was welcomed in the USA by my brother James, staying several days with the family there. The old Queen Elizabeth, then a troop ship brought me to Southampton, next day to be greeted by my family and later, by a host of friends! “Following a period of ing health, I was eventually led back into teaching until retirement age was reached.” The horrendous experience of imprisonment and a nuclear attack however did not appear to dissuade Rev Barker from giving up on his mission or other duties in Manchuria. Thomas, also it seems had the ear of the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong. And, despite the all encompasing rise of communism in China, he was allowed to continued teaching up until  when the leader of the Peoples Republic of China could no longer guarantee his safety-but Thomas Barker remained in contact with Mao Zedong up until shortly before his death. The cleric was -years-old when he ed to Ireland and was appointed as minister to the Presbyterian Church in Donegal town in  where he remained in service until . In recognition of his missionary service and his undoubted capabilities as a pastor the Church made him Moderator of the Presbyterian Church between - and his alma mater, Trinity College made awarded him an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. When he passed away in , aged  Rev Dr Thomas McCurdy Barker was buried at Castlerock in Co Derry. His father William, mother Mary who died in  and his brother, also a Presbyterian minister, Rev William Alexander Barker who passed away in  are buried in Derry City Cemetery.

He was killed aged just  whilst taking part in the dam busters raid in May, .Reporter: Eamon Sweeney::  Oct   addthis, Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II.Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II. William Bolitho, Richards father, was a Cornish commercial traveller in the seed business who stayed on in Ireland after marrying Jane Cuthbertson, the daughter of a local land steward, from Braehead just outside the city. In  the Bolithos moved from Derry to the town of Kimberley in Nottinghamshire where they bought a hotel. Presumably, while his mother and father got the new business up and running, Richard moved in with his aunt Emily who owned a local fruit and vegetable store. But, after her death, William Bolitho sold the hotel and took over the shop. googletag.cmd.push The young Richard Bolitho, an only child, was educated at the nearby Church Hill School and from there won a scholarship to Heanor Grammar School in . He joined the RAF in  but it wasnt until  that he was selected for aircrew training. After qualying as an air gunner Bolitho was posted to an operational training unit where he teamed with five others and they all flew together for the first time on February , . Six weeks later they were all posted to the newly formed  Squadron. Before WWII the British Air Ministry had identied the industrialised Ruhr valley as an important strategic target. The dams along the valley were the valuable source of providing hydroelectric power and pure water for steel-making as well as drinking water and water for the canal transport system in Germany. The belief was that attacks on the dams with large bombs could effectively cripple the manufacturing base heavily prized by the Nazis but at this stage the RAF had been unable to accurately hit hard enough to achieve that aim. It was calculated that a surprise nocturnal attack could work but there was no explosive device capable of achieving it. This is where Barnes Wallis came in. A scientist, engineer and inventor in early  he had begun experimenting with skipping marbles over water tanks in his garden. From this he developed a paper called Spherical Bomb-Surface Torpedo, the idea being that a bomb could skip over the surface of water, avoid torpedo nets and sink directly beside a battleship or a dam and act as a depth charge with the surrounding water concentrating the force of the explosion on the target. Wallis also developed backspin on these devices that would cause the bombs to trail behind the aircraft that dropped it and decreased the chance that the plane would be damaged by the explosion. It also increased the range of the bombs and prevented them from moving away from the target wall as it sank. After initial doubts, the RAF accepted Wallis bouncing bomb for attacks on the Mohne, Edersee and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr valley. Operation Chastise was carried out on - May,  by Squadron  which included Richard Bolitho. Using two spotlights to gauge the correct height, a modied Lancaster Bomber dropped a backspin drum shaped bomb which bounced over the dams torpedo nets hit the wall and spun down to the base before exploding. The Mohne and Edersee Dams were hit and caused catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and the villages in the Eder area. The Sorpe dam sustained minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and and several more damaged. Factories and coal mines were also destroyed. The human cost was also catastrophic. Overall, an estimated , civilians- Germans and , mainly forced labourers from the Soviet Union died. By necessity of achieving their aim, one plane flew so low that it hit the sea with the result that its bomb was torn off and scooped up seawater into the fuselage. Another plane was consumed by flames when it ploughed straight into high voltage electricity cables. However, some historians have argued about the levels of success that the raids achieved stating that the dams were repaired in a matter of five months. The head of the RAF, Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought that the entire episode had been harebrained all along later wrote: I have seen nothing to show that the effort was worthwhile except as a spectacular operation. The inventor of the bouncing bomb Barnes Wallis was awarded the sum of pound, for his war work from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. But, because of the loss of so many peoples lives during the raids he donated the entire amount to Christs Hospital School in  which allowed the children of the RAF personnel killed or injured to attend the school. Richard Bolithos last leave from the RAF before what became known as the Dam Busters raid was spent at home in Kimberley, Nottinghamshire where he was joined by his colleagues Flyod Wile, John Kinnear and Albert Garshowitz. Days later, in the early hours of Monday, May   all of them were killed during the raid. Sergeant Richard Bolitho was rear gunner on the mission his Lancaster Bomber was sent out on the first wave of aircraft taking part in the attacks. Their plane went down near Marbeck in Germany after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and were buried at Borken. They were later reinterred at Reichwald Forest War Cemetery. In all,  men in  planes took part in the attacks on the dams- of them died and three were captured. The Derry born Dam Buster is remembered on a war memorial which was first placed at his former school, Heanor Grammar School and later moved to Marpool All Saints Church in Nottinghamshire when the school closed in . Richard Blothios name is also on the war memorial at Kimberley, the village where he grew up. In May, ,  years after the Dam Busters raids on Germany portraits of all  men painted by artist Dan Llywelyn were unveiled at the Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln and the Dambusters Inn at Scampton in Lincolnshire from where the Lancaster bombers departed. In , three years after Richard Bolithos death, his parents ed to live in Northern Ireland and saw out their days in Portrush. Thirty-one years earlier on November ,  Richard Bolithos grandmother, Jane Cuthbertson from Braehead was buried at Derry City Cemetery having passed away at the age of . Her husband, Robert Cuthbertson was buried with his we having passed away on February ,  aged . Their daughter Jane Bolitho, Richards mother, died aged  on November ,  and is buried with her parents. Her husband William had died  years before her on May , aged  but is buried in his own plot in the city cemetery.

And quite literally rising out of the ashes into a stronger, more resilient club with first class facilities. “Sean Dolans GAC are always welcoming new members and supporters, and I would urge the community in Creggan to get behind the club to ensure that this development is successful in building a vibrant Gaelic community not just in Creggan, but in this city.

A report entitled, ‘Unearthed’, summarises some of the most signicant archaeological discoveries in Northern Ireland between  and . In this period almost  licensed archaeological excavations took place, mainly as a requirement of the planning process. The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division . The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope. googletag.cmd.push The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills. Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC. A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven. It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago. At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC. Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people. HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage. “It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”  Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure. Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery. An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially. This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels. Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They are too honest a team to sugar-coat the situation: more than anyone, these players know they have failed once again on the biggest stage. Before the tournament, Ireland were up front about their ambition - getting beyond the quarter-finals for the first time was the minimum expectation. With New Zealand or South Africa lying in wait in the quarter-finals, that was always going to be easier said than done, but that shock defeat to Japan in their second pool game threw Ireland off course. Despite some words of bravado, they never really recovered. googletag.cmd.push It all started so well. They were clinical and accurate in thrashing Scotland - in Yokohama and it looked like they were timing their run well, after a number of poor performances earlier in the year. Suddenly, optimism soared. It seemed Ireland might be edging back to the outstanding form that appeared to make them genuine World Cup contenders, after they rounded off a brilliant  campaign by putting the All Blacks to the sword in Dublin. They were second to Japan in every department and that - defeat saw them lose control of their own destiny. Ultimately, it would pitch them against an irresistible All Blacks team in the knockout stages and not South Africa, as had been widely expected. A second underwhelming display in beating Russia caused further soul-searching, evenSchmidt put on a brave face when insisting he was largely happy with how his team had played. Against Samoa in their final pool game, Ireland were much better. They did enough to convince themselves – and many observers outside the camp – that they had a big performance in them. Ireland at their very best would have struggled against a New Zealand team in such devastating form, but it would have been some consolation to have gone out of the tournament after playing to the limit of their capabilities. They were drastically short of that. Before the game, Irish players spoke about the importance of walking off the pitch at the end, knowing they had done themselves justice, regardless of the outcome. They didn’t do that – and it will hurt for a long time to come. Exit Joe Schmidt For an Ireland coach with an unrivalled record of achievement, it was a devastating experience to lose so badly to the nation of his birth, after he had fashioned two historic victories against the All Blacks in  and . For more than six years, Schmidt has been utterly consumed by a job he now vacates, with defence coach Andy Farrell about to step up. As he acknowledged in the media conference after Ireland’s elimination, the high point for Schmidt’s team came a year too early in the World Cup cycle. The Ireland of  had more verve, more accuracy, better discipline a much lower error count. They could have been contenders in Japan, but a less confident squad stepped off the plane and only flattered to deceive against Scotland. Schmidt’s tenure was characterised by a cautious approach to team selection and a heavy reliance on the players who served him so well over the years. That didn’t change in Japan and ultimately the key men who helped him mastermind so many successes could not find their form of old. Irish player of the tournament Centre Garry Ringrose was in superb form early in the tournament and how his country needed him, with the injured Robbie Henshaw only making his entry in the final pool game. Ringrose was the only Ireland player to start all three of the first pool games. He did enough in those to lay claim to being Ireland’s best player in Japan, ahead of the tireless CJ Stander, but the competition for that distinction was less than intense. Memorable moment off the pitch Not for the first time, Ireland’s ever-passionate supporters had a better World Cup than the players they cheered from first to last. They have an extraordinary ability to get their hands on tickets, with the result that many Irish players talked about playing home games in Japan, such was the level of noise from their fans. That peaked in the moments before the quarter-final kicked off, when a rousing chorus of The Fields of Athenry completed drowned out the New Zealand haka.  Memorable moment on thepitch The rampaging Tadhg Furlong put his head down and beat four defenders to score a remarkable try in Ireland’s bonus-point win against Samoa in Fukuoka. What next  Andy Farrell, Ireland’s defence coach, now has the unenviable task of lting a group of players who will be scarred by this experience. His first task will be to appoint a new captain, following the retirement of that marvellous servant Rory Best. Farrell may opt for Johnny Sexton in the short-term, but many feel that the gted lock forward James Ryan, just , is an Ireland captain in waiting. Another young gun, Jordan Larmour, acquitted himself well in his first World Cup and looks like a long-term option at full-back and Farrell will surely be looking to freshen up the team in other areas. Quotes of the tournament  “You carry your scars a lot more than your successes and the scars are deep and that is why I am a bit broken by it. But when I get some distance to reflect, we’ve had maybe  test matches and won  per cent of them.” –Joe Schmidt. “Its deja vu all over again. We shot ourselves in the foot and New Zealand capitalised on it. Its hard enough playing against them with our A game, never mind our D game” – MunstersKeith Earls, who was one of his countrys better performers despite not adding to his try total How did they do  Ireland  Scotland  Ireland  Japan  Ireland  Russia  Ireland  Samoa  Ireland  New Zealand  Ireland by numbers  - The number of times Ireland have been knocked out in the World Cup quarter-finals. They were also eliminated in a play-offand in the pool phase . – The number of missed Ireland tackles against New Zealand – and also the points dference between the teams. An error-strewn performance from a team that rose, briefly, to number one in the world on the back of a strong defence. – The uncharacteristic number of penalties conceded by Ireland against New Zealand. This compares with only five given away when Ireland beat the All Blacks in November .

That has to be the target,” he insisted. “There are six points up for grabs Bohemians are three ahead of us but I think we are two goals ahead of them now. We want to try and make six points upwe can but we know that’s extremely dficult but we’re at home and our home form has been good. “We are playing a team that is competing for Europe on Tuesday night and we need the fans, we need everyone in Derry to muster the effort and energy to come and support us because it would be brilliant and it could be a really good occasion. This is going to go to the last game no matter what andwe want to finish third orwe want to qualy for Europe then we have two games to win. googletag.cmd.push Unusual City’s winning goal was unusual to say the least but for Devine it was a case of his team making their own luck.“I think it started with our aggressive press,” he said. “It started with David Parkhouse pushing really hard to get down the line. Obviously it was a bit of fortune for us but Barry had to be in there, he had to be chasing the ball down. “It was a bit of fortune but over the course of the year we haven’t carried a lot of luck. We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The original production featured footage of the Foyle River, Grianán Fort and other border landmarks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but for Mexico, this has been replaced by stunning new drone shots of the landscapes of Guadalajara – while the voice and words of Dublin spoken word poet Stephen James Smith on the track “This Island” have been substituted by those of Mexican poet, Elba. Eoin said he hoped the piece, which  takes audiences on a cinematic journey, questioning what borders mean to people, would resonate with the people of Mexico. “About two years ago I was working with other artists in Jalisco and happened to mention the Borders project – it seemed to resonate with them – what with the US border and Trump wall - and felt like something that needed to be performed there. We’d also always wanted to perform Borders on a large scale and I already had connections with the Zapopan Symphony Orchestra, so creating this new version just seemed like a good fit. “The original piece with Stephen James Smith focused on the way we live now and how it’s ok to be both Irish and British – so we wanted to do something similar in Mexico. “Luckily, Elba understood and got what we wanted straight away and will perform her own version with us on the night. “The crazy thing about the whole project was the drone shots when I initially looked at them, I thought they were taken in Ireland, not Mexico. We were kind of disappointed as we were expecting cacti everywhere, but the coastal landscapes look just like Donegal.  \"I guess it shows how much this is a global story – how lines are just man made and how this could have taken place on any country on earth.” Supported by the British Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the pair will perform alongside the city’s Zapopan Symphony Orchestra – a full -piece orchestra - in their biggest gig of the year. This is not the first time Borders has been performed outside the North, with full capacity shows across Ireland, Britain and Europe, triggering a similar response with each audience. “There have been a lot of tears. The reaction so far has been pretty emotional, even most recently, during our Paris performance, which was unexpected.  \"People were seeing things in the visuals that we weren’t expecting, as they were left to interpret in their own way. The tears aren’t from sadness or depression though, but hope. “There’s a real communal feel during the shows with a lot of people fed up with what’s happening in the world - it’s quite beautul really, to be surrounded by a group people who feel the same way as you. He concluded: “I think we’ll get a similar reaction in Mexico,not more so – especially since we’re touching on their own problems and have Elba there to read her more personalised, local poem.” Following Mexico, it’s going to be a busy few months for the pair – performing Borders in Berlin, Toulouse and across Britain. Ryan said: “Next month we’re off to Berlin for the th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by a full UK tour, then in March we’ll be playing at SXSW in Austin Texas. After that, we’re not sure, but it would be amazing to take Borders somewhere like Palestine or North Korea.” Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland, said it was an honour to bring “Borders” to a wider audience. He said: “We’re delighted to support this project and help showcase Eoin and Ryan’s work internationally. “The times we live in can be incredibly isive, especially around the issue of borders, so it has never been more important for work such as this to reach wider audiences. Borders is a mesmerising visual spectacular and creates a world where boundaries just don’t exist physically but can also be metaphorical, and we hope that this message resonates and captivates the audiences in Guadalajara.” Borders will be performed this Friday and Saturday,  and  October, at the Centro Cultural Zapopan, Guadalajara.\",\"keywords\":\"Derry,MExico,Borders,Brexit\",\"articleSection\":\"Whats On\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Two Derry musicians are taking their ground- breaking audio-visual project, ldquoBorders, which began as a non-political reaction to Brexit, to Central America this weekend.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences.

He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials.

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time.

It was crazy. Amber was born in her whole sac, she continued.ldquoI did what the midwives told me to do because she was in the water [the sac]. I was already in early labour when I went for a hospital appointment but while they wanted me to stay, I said that I would rather go back home as I wanted to do everything as natural.ldquoThey advised me not to come back in until my waters broke but they didnrsquot break. I came back around .pm and Amber was born two hours later. My sister-in-law Megan says that she saw Amber inside the sac and moving around and I think the midwives had to pop the sac.The  year-old was one day overdue when she gave birth to Amber who weighed in at lbs ozs.Hannah added: ldquoThe midwe said it was absolutely unbelievable and the staff got other midwives in to have a look as the birth was so rare and caused such excitement. The birth was just perfect and Amber was perfect. The staff themselves couldnrsquot believe it happened.Megan, who will be godmother to the new baby, says she was honoured to have been at the birth.ldquoIt was just amazing and I canrsquot stop talking about it, said the mother of two.ldquoI saw Amber moving about in what looked like a balloon for about a minute after she was born.ldquoI called Tommy over to have a look but he was a bit nervous about it but I couldnrsquot stop looking. The midwe had to break the sac but Amber also seemed to reach out at the same time with her hand. It was just so special to see.Amber, who is now six days old and is thriving well, is one of a number of famous people down through the centuries who share this honour of being born in the lsquocaulrsquo mdash the thin membrane which covers the baby and its amniotic fluid.Emperors and leaders such Alexander the Great, King Charlemagne, Napoleon, the poet Lord Byron and father of modern psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, and the late flamboyant entertainer Liberace, are all reputed to have been born this way.Seen in many cultures as portentously luckyborn ldquowith a veil over the face, the child is meant to have a lelong affinity with water.A spokesperson for South Eastern Trust which manages the Lagan Valley hospital, confirmed the auspicious delivery.ldquoThis patient laboured naturally and her waters remained unbroken so as a result the baby was born in the amniotic sac. This is known as a lsquocaulrsquo and is very rare, happening in one in every , to , births.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered.

Not content with being a part of an iconic Down team, Eamonn was a man who was committed to giving back.ldquoHis club in Bryansford benefited and in more recent times he was prepared to put himself forward to take charge of the county team for three years and pass on his knowledge to a new generation of Down players.ldquoOn and off the field he was a great ambassador for our Association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Tributes have also been paid by former Down GAA legend Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty who referred to the late Eamonn Burns as ldquoa true legend because of the person he was.Doherty said: ldquoWhat very, very few people know is that in the build-up to one of the All-Ireland finals mdash I wonrsquot say which one mdash Eamonn was quietly nursing an injury. But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Russian and Syrian government forces would move into that area immediately to ensure the Kurdish fighters pull back  miles from the border.Then at the end of the  hours, Russian-Turkish patrols would begin along a six-mile wide strip of the border.The exception would be the region around the town of Qamishli at the far eastern end of the border, which has some of the densest Kurdish population.Russian and Turkish officials did not immediately say what the arrangement would be around Qamishli.ldquoI believe that this agreement will start a new era toward Syriarsquos lasting stability and it being cleared of terrorism.ldquoI hope that this agreement is beneficial to our countries and to our brothers in Syria, Mr Erdogan said. -- vw,vw,px, px\"US defence secretary Mark Esper  --Turkey will keep control of the section in the centre of the border that it captured in its invasion that began on October .That is the territory that Kurdish fighters withdrew from under the US-brokered ceasefire.It extends roughly  miles wide and  miles deep between the Syrian border towns of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn.A senior Kurdish official, Redur Khalil, confirmed his forces had entirely left that area.But he said Turkish troops and their allies were continuing military operations in northeastern Syria outside that withdrawal zone.The Kurdish-led forces notied the White House of the completed withdrawal in a letter, a senior Trump administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the contents of the letter.After the US announced its pullout earlier this month, Turkey launched its invasion, saying it wanted to carve out a safe zone cleared of Kurdish fighters whom it considers terrorists.Turkey also plans to settle many of the . million Syrian refugees on its soil in that zone, which is the heartland of Syriarsquos Kurdish minority.For the Kurds, a Turkish takeover would mean the crushing of the self-rule they have carved out in the northeast amid Syriarsquos civil war.They also fear massive demographic change, as Kurdish civilians flee Turkish control and mainly Arab Syrian refugees move in. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan shake hands  --The new agreement aims to ease those fears by giving Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, control over much of the area, with the Turkish patrols limited to closer to the border.That may prevent a massive flight of civilians but would be a heavy blow to Kurdish autonomy dreams.The Russia-Turkey deal goes a considerable way to restoring the control of Moscowrsquos ally, the Syrian government, across much of the northeast.Syrian President Bashar Assad has vowed to reunite all the territory under Damascusrsquo rule.On Tuesday, Mr Assad said he was ready to support any ldquopopular resistance against Turkeyrsquos invasion.Mr Erdogan is ldquoa thief, Mr Assad told troops during a visit to the northwestern province of Idlib.ldquoHe stole the factories and the wheat and the oil in cooperation with Daeshand now is stealing the land.ldquoWe are in the middle of a battle and the right thing to do is to rally efforts to lessen the damages from the invasion and to expel the invader sooner or later, Mr Assad said.Mr Assadrsquos visit to Idlib underlined Damascusrsquo goal of regaining the border.Idlib is adjacent to a border enclave that Turkey captured several years ago in another incursion.Turkey also has observation points inside Idlib, negotiated with Russia, to monitor a ceasefire there between the government and opposition fighters and jihadi groups.He said his government had offered clemency to Kurdish fighters, whom it considers separatists, to ldquoensure that everyone is ready to resist the aggression and fight the Turkish assault.Syrian state media reported, meanwhile, that government forces entered new areas in Hassakeh province at the far eastern end of the border, under the arrangement with the Kurds..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Russia and Turkey strike deal to take control of part of Syrian border article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.
