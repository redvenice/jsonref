Photograph: Laura HuttonThe . Some 1.9 million hens in Ireland live in cages that are 75cmsq, about the same size s a sheet of A4 paper, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) has said. The organisation on Thursday asked Irish consumers to use the Easter break to spend time thinking “where do your eggs really come from?” as it sought to draw attention to a European petition to “end the cage”. ISPCA chief executive Dr Andrew Kelly said the organisation was not against egg-farming. However, he said better living conditions for hens meant better quality eggs which commanded better prices and offered consumers a heathier product. He said improving the living conditions of the animals was “a win-win-win” situation.The ISPCA is working with Eurogroup for Animals and Compassion in World Farming to seek a ban on the use of cages by 2025. He said Tesco, McDonalds, Aldi and Lidl had already gone “cage free” when choosing the eggs they sell. ‘Battery’The use of “barren” or “battery” cages, where the hens are inidually held, was banned in the EU from 2012 for welfare reasons, but “enriched” cages can still be used. These allow slightly more movement to hens who are caged collectively, but still limit natural behaviours such as exercising. Although inidual cages are not used, in enriched cages each hen has just about the same space as an A4 sheet of paper, Dr Kelly said. So far the ‘End the Cage Age’ campaign, a European Citizen’s Initiative which is seeking to get one million signatures, has been supported by more than 700,000 EU citizens , including close to 7,000 in Ireland. Egg producers and retailers are required to label their egg packaging which is displayed on the inside of all egg cartons. How a hen has lived and laid her eggs must be stamped on the packs. The number 1 means that the egg is free range, 2 means originating from a barn, 3 for caged hens and 0 for organic. “The End the Cage Age initiative is the single biggest and most collaborative animal welfare campaign to be launched in this generation,” Dr Kelly said. “Over 140 animal welfare organisations across Europe are participating, and we are incredibly close to one million EU Citizens supporting a cage-free future for farm animals.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3864631.1555613599!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit should be aberration in discussion on ni peace says nancy pelosi","story":"Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, describes her experience of visiting the Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland 21-years-ago versus today.

Thank you so much for your leadership.”Referring to a visit the Humes had made to her home 30 years ago, she said: “John Hume said to us that night, when we try to take down the walls in Northern Ireland, we must also take down the walls in our hearts for peace. He continues to do so.”‘One community, two traditions’Congressman Neal said Derry had been “so far ahead of the rest of the province because of the chances you took, and that was because of John Hume”.“I remember coming here in a very different time,” he said, “and I bring that up because one of John’s favourite quotes was America, it was e pluribus unum – of many, one.“It was consistent with John’s belief in agreement without uniformity.“You are so far ahead of the rest of the province because of the chances you took, that was because of John Hume.“It’s only one community but two traditions, and I think that’s what we want to embrace, the idea that we grow together, and the differences diminish.“There can be no return to any sort of hard Border.”Ms Pelosi praised the people of Derry for their role in achieving peace. “Congratulations,” she said, “on what you have done here in Derry and your role in achieving peace.”The Belfast Agreement, she said, had served as “a beacon to the rest of the world”.“Far be it from any of us to want that to be dimmed by anything that the Brexit conversations could bring down on the Good Friday accord, you just can’t do it.”Earlier, Ms Pelosi visited the Derry-Donegal Border and spoke briefly to anti-Brexit protestors from Border Communities Against Brexit.“We believe that Brexit should be just an aberration in this discussion as we continue to build and strengthen the peace that was generated by the Good Friday Accord,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File Photograph: KCNAEPA North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will travel to Russia this month for talks with President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said on Thursday, announcing the first Russia-North Korea summit since Mr Kim came to power in 2011.The announcement coincided with a moment of discord in efforts by US president Donald Trump’s administration to reach a deal with Mr Kim to end nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula.North Korea said on Thursday it no longer wanted to deal with US secretary of state Mike Pompeo and called for him to be replaced in talks by somebody more mature. That demand came shortly after North Korea announced that Mr Kim had overseen the testing of a new tactical guided weapon, which KCNA, the North’s official news agency, said has a “peculiar mode of guiding flight” and “a powerful warhead.” It was the North’s first weapon test since talks in Vietnam between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in late February broke down over conflicting demands by North Korea for sanctions relief and by the United States for North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme. KCNA gave no details on the weapon that was tested on Wednesday but implied it was a short-range weapon rather than the long-range ballistic missiles that have been seen as a threat to the United States. The agency quoted senior foreign ministry official Kwon Jong-gun as saying the Vietnam summit, the second between the two leaders, showed that talks could go wrong “whenever Pompeo pokes his nose in”. “I am afraid that, if Pompeo engages in the talks again, the table will be lousy once again and the talks will become entangled,” Mr Kwon said. “Therefore, even in the case of possible resumption of the dialogue with the United States, I wish our dialogue counterpart would be not Pompeo but another person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us.” ‘Ready to engage’A spokeswoman for the US State Department said it was aware of the report about Mr Pompeo and added: “The United States remains ready to engage North Korea in a constructive negotiation.”The pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper cited a diplomatic source on Wednesday as saying the Putin-Kim meeting would likely take place next week in Russia’s far eastern city of Vlaostok before Mr Putin flies on to an April 26th-27th summit in China. It added, however, that a sudden change of plan by Mr Kim could not be ruled out. The Kremlin gave no further details in a statement on its website, but Moscow has been saying for months that it was working on such a meeting.Mr Kim came to power in 2011 following the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, who had visited Russia for a summit with then president Dmitry Medvedev earlier that year. It was not clear how Mr Kim might travel to Russia, which shares a border with North Korea.A North Korean official, Kim Chang-son, travelled to Vlaostok this week and was seen on Wednesday inspecting the Pacific port city’s train station and making security checks, Russia’s RIA news agency reported on Thursday.US special representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun met Russian deputy foreign minister Igor Morgulov in Moscow on Thursday and discussed ways to advance a “final, fully verified denuclearisation of North Korea”, the US embassy in Moscow said.The embassy said in a statement that the talks had been “constructive”. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

I imagine something like the \u0027wargs\u0027 from \u0027Lord of the Rings,\u0027” said  Mr Borths, referring to fictional monstrous wolves.Simbakubwa\u0027s name means “big lion” in Swahili though it was not a cat. It was the largest predator in its ecosystem, a fragmented forest inhabited by early apes, hippo relatives and elephant relatives.“It was not an animal built for long efficient runs across open ground.

It is a burst of violence painted in haunting tones by a Renaissance master worth at least $100 million -- or yet another fake distressing the art world. Lord Andrew Tyrie, CMA chairman, said: “People’s livelihoods, savings and pensions all depend on the auditors’ job being done to a high standard.“But too many fall short – more than a quarter of big company audits are considered sub-standard by the regulator. This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone.

It is a burst of violence painted in haunting tones by a Renaissance master worth at least $100 million -- or yet another fake distressing the art world. Lord Andrew Tyrie, CMA chairman, said: “People’s livelihoods, savings and pensions all depend on the auditors’ job being done to a high standard.“But too many fall short – more than a quarter of big company audits are considered sub-standard by the regulator. This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In contrast, food stores enjoyed a 3.3 per cent\u0026nbspannual rise while\u0026nbsptextile, clothing and footwear stores saw a 7.1 per cent\u0026nbspincrease.Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: “March’s mild weather boosted sales, with food shops also recovering after a weak February”.The resilience of consumers in the face of Brexit uncertainty has been helped in part by high levels of employment. The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

colleagues for their efforts and dedication during such a turbulent time, as well as our suppliers, partners and of course customers for their continued support.”Mr Bucher had already been forced off the retailer\u0027s board after Mike Ashley staged a coup which ousted him and former chairman Ian Cheshire in January.Mr Duddy said: “Debenhams now has a clear path towards a viable and sustainable future and we have Sergio and his team to thank for that.“With a positive, professional approach, he has acted at all times in the company\u0027s best interests, and we wish him all the best for the future.”The company’s 165 stores will initially continue to trade\u0026nbspbut 50 have been earmarked for closure within three to five years, putting around 4,000 jobs at risk.Debenhams has struggled

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn. What will be harder is finding an alternative assessment system that both parents and schools will back.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the participants in the study this amounted to an average difference of two stone (13kg) by middle age, between the most affected and protected groups.The researchers, led by\u0026nbspMIT\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspHarvard Medical School, have\u0026nbspdeveloped this into a genetic “risk score” which can show how great someone’s risk might be, and which could potentially be used from birth to take protective action.“We have always had a hunch that some people may have been born with a genetic profile that predisposes them to obesity, and we now confirm that this is both true and quantifiable,” said Dr Amit Khera, one of the authors and a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital.Created with Sketch.Health news in pictures Show all 44Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.144 Junk food ads could be banned before watershedJunk food adverts on TV and online could be banned before 9pm as part of Government plans to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity.244 Breeding with neanderthals helped humans fight diseasesOn migrating from Africa around 70,000 years ago, humans bumped into the neanderthals of Eurasia.

Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued.

Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer.

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1944 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues2044 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.2144 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.2244 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2844 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part3144 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.3244 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves3344 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.3444 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.3544 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3644 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3744 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3844 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3944 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.4044 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.4144 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4244 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4344 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4444 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. However, Dr Khera said,\u0026nbsp“DNA is not destiny” when it comes to weight gain and a “healthy diet and exercise can offset a genetic predisposition”.“It is also likely true that those with a high genetic predisposition have to work much harder to maintain a normal weight,” he added.The research, published in the journal Cell, analysed more than 2\u0026nbspmillion genetic variants known to have an impact on body-mass index (BMI), some which will increase obesity and some which will be protective.Hancock accused of ‘astonishing ignorance’ after taking genetic testThis data comes from more than 300,000 people who have added their health and genetic information to research libraries, however, the mostly European population means the applicability of findings to other groups is less certain.It found that the top 10 per cent of people with the most genetic variants linked to a higher BMI also had\u0026nbspdouble the risk of weight-related type 2 diabetes of those in the most protected category.Obesity causing liver disease ‘time bomb’ in teens and young adultsPatients lose weight with stomach blood supply-blocking treatmentTest revealing genetic risk of disease has ‘no impact on lifestyle’ Because these are average scores there could be much heavier or lighter iniduals within both the most genetically at risk group, and the least.But looking at them as a group the researchers said that by age three they could begin to see the effects of the\u0026nbsphigher genetic risk showing in children’s weight. By age eight this high risk group were 3.5kg heavier.While these findings don’t affect the weight they are born, the effects begin to be seen by childhood and play out into adulthood, also affecting the risk of weight-related conditions like type 2 diabetes.“The score is associated with only minimal differences in birth weight, but it predicts clear differences in weight during early childhood and profound differences on weight trajectory and risk of developing severe obesity in subsequent years,” says senior author Sekar Kathiresan of the Broad Institute.The authors say that these genetic risk scores could be used in future to minimise their genetic risks by making healthier life choices. However, their usefulness at predicting risks when so many other factors are involved remains controversial.“While outstanding questions include whether genetic predisposition to severe obesity can be reduced, these findings should put further pressure on health departments and ministries to recognise obesity as a disease,” said Dr Rishi Caleyachetty, of Warwick Medical School, who was not involved in the study.Professor Tim Frayling of the University of Exeter said spotting people with the most “fat genes” could be particularly helpful in childhood\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspdiet and lifestyle interventions can have the most benefit.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the origins of Easter, and we’re learning more every day.”It is not clear how, when or why the rabbit became linked to the Easter festival, although it could be due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs.The folkloric figure of the Easter Bunny bringing eggs for children is closely linked to German traditions.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Specimens including the animal’s jaw, portions of its skull, and parts of its skeleton were placed in a drawer at the National Museums of Kenya and not given a great deal of attention until Ohio University researchers Dr Nancy Stevens and Dr Matthew Borths rediscovered them, apparently immediately recognising their significance.Created with Sketch.Insects preserved in amber for millions of years  Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This ant preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis moss twig preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis spider beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis lace bug preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis park-winged fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis click beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis wedge shaped beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThese photos from photographer Levon Biss are for sale in a frame crafted from fossilised Bog Oak that has been preserved underground in peat bogs for 5300 years.The frame contains the actual piece of amber that features in the photographThis ant preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis moss twig preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis spider beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis lace bug preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis park-winged fungus gnat preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis click beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThis wedge shaped beetle preserved in amber dates from 40-45 million years ago and was discovered in the BalticsThese photos from photographer Levon Biss are for sale in a frame crafted from fossilised Bog Oak that has been preserved underground in peat bogs for 5300 years.The frame contains the actual piece of amber that features in the photograph“Opening a museum drawer, we saw a row of gigantic meat-eating teeth, clearly belonging to a species new to science,” lead author of the study, Dr Borths said. The research team calculated the species would have weighed up to 1.5 metric tonnes, and could have fed on elephant-like creatures.“Based on its massive teeth, Simbakubwa was a specialised hyper-carnivore that was significantly larger than the modern lion and possibly larger than a polar bear,” he told AFP.The species comes from a group known as the hyaenodonts, which were the first mammalian carnivores in Africa, and lived around 22 million years ago.For about 45 million years after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, hyaenodonts were the apex predators on the continent. But after millions of years of near-isolation, tectonic movements of the Earth’s plates connected Africa with the northern continents, allowing floral and faunal exchange between landmasses. Tiny T rex: Ancestor to the king of the dinosaurs discoveredMassive asteroid will pass Earth closer than the MoonEndangered hen harriers ‘being wiped out by illegal killing’Ice ages ‘triggered by massive collisions at Earth’s equator’Around the time of Simbakubwa, the relatives of cats, hyenas, and dogs began to arrive in Africa from Eurasia.As the relatives of cats and dogs were going south, the relatives of Simbakubwa were going north. “It’s a fascinating time in biological history,” Dr Borths said. “Lineages that had never encountered each other begin to appear together in the fossil record.”The second part of the new species’ name, kutokaafrika, is Swahili for “coming from Africa” because Simbakubwa is the oldest of the gigantic hyaenodonts, suggesting this lineage of giant carnivores originated on the African continent and slowly moved northward to flourish for millions of years.But despite the species longevity, hyaenodonts eventually went extinct across the world. As global ecosystems changed between 18 and 15 million years ago with grasslands replacing forests, new mammalian lineages ersified.“We don’t know exactly what drove hyaenodonts to extinction, but ecosystems were changing quickly as the global climate became drier. The gigantic relatives of Simbakubwa were among the last hyaenodonts on the planet,” Dr Borths said.Dr Stevens, who co-authored the study, said: “This is a pivotal fossil, demonstrating the significance of museum collections for understanding evolutionary history.” “Simbakubwa is a window into a bygone era. As ecosystems shifted, a key predator disappeared, heralding Cenozoic (most recent) faunal transitions that eventually led to the evolution of the modern African fauna.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalThe Blood Moon, for example, appears red in the sky due to something called Raleigh scattering.This occurs when sunlight passes through the Earth\u0027s atmosphere and is the same effect that causes sunsets to appear red.When Friday\u0027s full moon appears above the horizon, Rayleigh scattering will cause the moon to appear orange to observers on the ground. The higher in the sky it rises, the lighter it appears.\u0026nbspMassive asteroid will pass Earth closer than the MoonThe moon also appears larger to terrestrial observers when it is close to the horizon thanks to the moon illusion.The reason for this optical illusion is still a matter of debate, though one of the most common theories is that the moon\u0027s relative size to buildings, trees and other objects on the horizon makes it appear bigger than when it is high in the sky and surrounded by the vastness of space.Another celestial event is also set to take place on Thursday, with Asteroid 2019 GC6 set to pass the Earth on Thursday at half the distance to the Moon.Unfortunately for anyone hoping to spot it, astronomers have described it as trying to spot a lump of coal in the night sky.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She has since been caring full-time for her two children, one of whom has severe autism.In October 2018, the US national travelled to America for two weeks due to the father being ill. On her return, she was told she had no right to enter, and days later\u0026nbspshe received a notice from the Home Office stating that there was a ticket booked for her removal the following Thursday morning.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Cullen said: “I was just panicking because I couldn’t even\u0026nbspcontact a barrister over the weekend. My children would’ve gone into care because my husband was out of the country at the time. I was living like there was no tomorrow. It felt like everything was falling apart.“They said that if I didn’t board the flight I’d be arrested where I lived and forcibly removed. We were making preparations with social services and school. My children would have been devastated. This is the life that they know.”Ms Cullen’s barrister Morgan Read successfully sought an emergency injunction on the grounds that the department had failed to consider the welfare of her children\u0026nbspin breach of UK law.Despite this, and the fact that she\u0026nbspwas granted a British residence card in January, Ms Cullen is still on immigration bail, and the Home Office still has her passport.\u0026nbsp“I felt like I was finally getting over it, that the judge said I could stay. It just doesn’t make sense. They’ve agreed that I do have the right to be here. It’s like I’m allowed to be here but not allowed to leave,“\u0026nbspsaid Ms Cullen. “It’s baffling really that they don’t seem to consider any human part of this. I feel like I’m just a number. They wanted to protect the border by tearing a mother from her children.“My mother is starting to forget who I am because I’m not there. I just feel lost. This time is precious and they’re taking that from me.”Ms Cullen’s solicitor Arta Heath, managing director of MyUKVisas, said the Home Office’s attempt to deport the mother-of-two\u0026nbspwas “absolutely outrageous”.She said the\u0026nbsppassport issue was a\u0026nbspsymptom of both the hostile environment and “complete incompetence” in the department.Most immigration removals cancelled amid ‘dearth of legal advice’“This is a terrible situation. The Home Office said it knew she had British citizen children but that they could stay with their father, which is absolutely outrageous. They claimed that because had spent two weeks without their mum they could be without her forever,” said Ms Heath.“But the issue now is the administrative process.\u0026nbspThere is no reason for them to hold onto her passport, but they haven’t sent it to her and the removal direction process is still continuing, meaning she can’t go see her mum.“It shows how the inability of the Home Office to understand law and procedure, coupled with the hostile environment, is leading to shocking decisions being made.”Responding to the case, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “It seems the Home Office have ignored what is humane and sensible. Instead they have continued with the tick-box exercises, which have characterised this Tory government’s hostile environment.\u0026nbsp“Until these dreadful policies end, families will live with the threat of being torn apart.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Forensics on Melville Street in Scotland, after the shooting of Trainspotting 2 star Bradley Welsh.

Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said this\u0026nbspwas not the first time the Home Office had “utterly failed to take into account children’s best interests in an immigration case”.\u0026nbspShe continued: “It is quite frankly astonishing that no attention was paid to the very clear interests of the British children in this sorry situation. Fortunately the children were not taken into care and their mother was allowed to enter but only as a result of an injunction that she took out. \u0026nbsp“We have had clients whose children have been taken into care as a result of the Home Office detaining a parent. This is completely contrary to the Home Office’s own policy and statutory duty and is utterly reprehensible.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet\u0026nbspthe UK is ranked lower than any of its western European neighbours except Italy.“We should hold ourselves to a higher standard, and seek to be one of the best, not worst-performing countries in western Europe,” said RSF’s UK director Rebecca Vincent. “Too often steps taken in the name of national security trample press freedom.”The US slipped three places to 48th in the world as a result of its increasingly hostile climate towards journalists. The report said that never before have US reporters been subjected to so many death threats or turned so often to private security for protection.Created with Sketch.Winners of the World Press Photo 2019 awards Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 World Press Photo of the Year 2019: Crying girl on the borderHonduran toddler Yanela Sanchez cries as she and her mother, Sandra Sanchez, are taken into custody by US border officials in McAllen, Texas, USA, on 12 June225 General News Photo of the year: The disappearance of Jamal KhashoggiAn unidentified man tries to hold back the press on 15 October, as Saudi investigators arrive at the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, amid a growing international backlash to the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi325 Nature Photo of the Year: Survival instinctFrogs with their legs severed and surrounded by frogspawn struggle to the surface, after being thrown back into the water in Covasna, Eastern Carpathians, Romania, in April 2018425 Sports Photo of the Year: Boxing in Katanga Boxer Morin Ajambo (30) trains in Katanga, a large slum settlement in Kampala, Uganda, on 24 March525 Contemporary Issues Photo of the Year: The CubanitasPura rides around her neighborhood in a pink 1950s convertible, as the community gathers to celebrate her fifteenth birthday, in Havana, Cuba625 Environment photo of the Year: Akashinga - the brave onesPetronella Chigumbura (30), a member of an all-female anti-poaching unit called Akashinga, participates in stealth and concealment training in the Phundundu Wildlife Park, Zimbabwe725 Portrait Photo of the Year: Dakar fashionDiarra Ndiaye, Ndeye Fatou Mbaye and Mariz Sakho model outfits by designer Adama Paris, in the Medina neighborhood of the Senegalese capital, Dakar, as curious residents look on825 General News Story of the Year: Yemen CrisisA woman begs outside a grocery store in Azzan, a pivotal southern crossroads town that had seesawed back and forth between government and insurgent forces in Yemen, on 22 May 2018.Photo by Lorenzo Tugnoli The Wa925 Spot news Story of the Year: Ambulance BombRahela, her face bloodied by shattered glass from the shop where she had been with her sister (right), is helped from the scene of a street bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan, before being taken to hospital1025 Contemporary Issues Story of the Year: Ireland\u0027s Struggle to Overturn Anti-Abortion LawsAbortion law reform campaigner Megan Scott, dressed as St Brigid, Ireland’s female patron, poses for a photograph on Dublin’s main shopping street, on 21 April. 1125 World Press Story of the Year: The Migrant CaravanPeople run to a truck that has stopped to give them a ride, outside Tapanatepec, Mexico, on 30 October 2018.

They have been dating for 19 monthsThe latest annual report offered a bleak assessment of reporting freedoms around the world, with experts finding a decline in the number of countries regarded as safe for journalists.Only 24 per cent of the 180 countries were classified as “good” or “fairly good” for the press – a two per cent decline – while over three-quarters of the world is now considered “problematic”, “difficult” or “very serious” for media freedoms.RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire said: “Democracy is in great danger. Halting this cycle of fear and intimidation is a matter of the utmost urgency of all people.”He added: “If the political debate slides surreptitiously or openly towards a civil war-style atmosphere, in which journalists are treated as scapegoats, then democracy is in great danger.”Norway is ranked first for press freedoms for the third consecutive year and Turkmenistan replaced North Korea in last place.The study’s authors said the level of violence used in some parts of the world to persecute journalists who aggravate authorities “no longer seems to know any limits”. They said the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October sent a “chilling message”.The Americas saw the greatest deterioration of any part of the world during the last year.

But if there were any weakening of the Good Friday accords there would be no chance whatsoever, a non-starter for a US-UK trade agreement.“The Good Friday accords ended 700 years of conflict. This is not a treaty only, it’s an ideal, it’s a value, it’s something that’s a model to the world, something that we all take pride in.“It was a model and other people have used it as a model and we don’t want that model to be something that can be bargained away in another agreement.”Created with Sketch.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In contrast, food stores enjoyed a 3.3 per cent\u0026nbspannual rise while\u0026nbsptextile, clothing and footwear stores saw a 7.1 per cent\u0026nbspincrease.Rhian Murphy, head of retail sales at the ONS, said: “March’s mild weather boosted sales, with food shops also recovering after a weak February”.The resilience of consumers in the face of Brexit uncertainty has been helped in part by high levels of employment. The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the clashes, on a day when only three of the state’s 42 constituencies were contested, are likely to lead to increased security measures in the coming weeks.The clashes in Chopra, Darjeeling meant that scores of people were unable to reach the polling station. Ajay V Nayek, a police official, said across the state polling was “overall peaceful”, and that those who were turned away were later escorted by security forces to cast their ballots.More than 155 million people were eligible to vote across the 13 states where polling took place on Thursday, and turnouts varied hugely across the country.Indian election workers travel 300 miles so that one person can voteIn India’s election, peace cannot be taken for grantedVoting begins in world’s greatest exercise of democracy Does India\u0027s opposition have what it takes to unseat Narendra Modi?In Srinagar, Kashmir, where separatists had called for a boycott of the election, just over 12 per cent of those eligible had cast their votes by 3pm, with only a few hours left before polling closed. That compared to some seats where the number was well over 70 per cent.A police official told Reuters there had been “at least 40” separate incidents of stone-pelting directed at the security forces, who are ubiquitous in the valley at the best of times and were on high alert for the day’s voting.Police deployed tear gas and baton charges in downtown Srinagar as protesters tried to disrupt the vote, officials said. At most polling booths, armed security personnel and election officials vastly outnumbered voters.Away from those hotspots, however, the day’s voting appeared to pass without serious incident. In Manipur, voters complained that chief minister N Biren Singh turned up in the afternoon and jumped the queue - reportedly skipping past some people who had been waiting since 7am.And at a Delhi press conference to announce a BJP candidate for a later phase, a protester pelted the ruling party’s spokesman and MP GVL Narasimha Rao with shoes. Rao immediately dismissed his assailant, who was bundled out by security, as being “Congress-inspired”.Here’s the run-through of the day’s election events, as they happened.Voting opened\u0026nbspat 7am IST (2.30am BST) across 13\u0026nbspstates and closed\u0026nbspat 6pmTamil Nadu\u0026nbspelection trends on social media as key state sees all its seats decided todayViolence reported in Darjeeling, West Bengal as rival party workers and riot police clashCPM candidate has car windows smashed in attack, accuses rival partyInternet services are suspended across Kashmir as Srinagar seat goes to pollsElection Commission watches Modi biopic and prepares to give ruling to Supreme CourtMore than 155 million people are eligible to vote today in 97 constituencies across 13 states.\u0026nbspIt is the second of seven phases in the election, designed to spread out the logistical and security challenges of conducting a democratic exercise in a country with more than 900 million eligible voters.The focus today will be on the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, with #TNElection2019 already the top trend across India on Twitter.All of Tamil Nadu\u0027s 39 seats, and half of Karnataka\u0027s 28, will be decided today.\u0026nbspThe south is a key region\u0026nbspwhere the main opposition Congress party and its allies need to win big if they hope to have any chance of ousting Narendra\u0026nbspModi\u0027s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).If the non-BJP parties perform well in these two states, then they would still be having a chance of forming a non-BJP government at the centre, Sanjay Kumar, director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, told Reuters.In southern Karnataka, both the BJP and Congress are hoping to make up seats, with the expectation that Mr Modi is unlikely to be able to repeat the near clean sweep he achieved across northern states in 2014.\u0026nbspBut it\u0027s also true that the BJP\u0027s Hindu-first agenda has struggled to take root to the same extent in the southern states.Critics say such isive election rhetoric is a threat to\u0026nbspIndia\u0027s secular foundations.Communal polarisation is obviously the biggest issue for me, said Rakesh Mehar, who voted in Karnataka\u0027s capital, Bengaluru. And the growing intolerance in the country is what worries me the most.While it is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi\u0027s first five years in office, this election is not just about what is going on with the central government.Voters in Bengaluru, once a sleepy retirement town that has been transformed into\u0026nbspIndia\u0027s technology hub, said they wanted lawmakers who would fix infrastructure problems such as traffic congestion and poor water management.We have been voting every time expecting a change but nothing has come so far. People are talking about national issues, Manjunath Munirathnappa told Reuters. But only when they fix the local issues will there be progress in the nation.\u0026nbspOne of the big talking points in the days before the election began on 12 April was the controversial planned release of a Bollywood biopic about the prime minister, entitled PM Narendra Modi.\u0026nbspThe Election Commission of India eventually decided that the film, which was seen as being positive about Mr Modi\u0027s life story, risked undermining the level playing field of the elections and ordered it and any other elements of hagiography not be released until after voting was over.\u0026nbspThe film\u0027s producers complained, however,\u0026nbspand the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the commissioners to at least watch the film before taking a decision.\u0026nbspThat viewing is understood to have taken place yesterday, and the commission must now deliver its new ruling to the apex court no later than Friday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt raises the prospect that, if the commission changes its mind, the film could hit cinemas before the third day of voting on 23 April. The film, starring the self-confessed Modi fan\u0026nbspVivek Oberoi in the lead role, traces the prime minister\u0027s rise from being the son of a tea seller to leader of the nation.Narendra Modi has been speaking this morning at a large rally in his home state of Gujarat.\u0026nbspWith Srinagar in Kashmir voting under extremely tight security today, Mr Modi talked at length on the subject of national security.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s the one issue his strategists at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been pushing more than any other since the turn of the year.\u0026nbspThe Modi administration came in for some criticism in the wake of the Pulwama bombing that killed 40 armed police in Kashmir in February, with questions raised over whether more could have been done to stop the attack.\u0026nbspSpeaking just now, Mr Modi defended his government\u0027s record, saying that terrorism had been contained to only two-and-a-half districts in Kashmir, and that no bombings had been seen outside these areas during his five years in power.\u0026nbspMr Modi also harked back to a 2016 incident where India claimed to have carried out targeted ground operations within Pakistan-administered Kashmir after a militant attack on an Indian army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir.\u0026nbspHe compared it to what he described as Congress\u0027s failure to act after the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\u0026nbspCongress did not do any thing after the Mumbai attack.\u0026nbspWhat did Modi do after Uri? I killed them by going in to their home with a surgical strike, he told the rally.\u0026nbspThe Independent travelled to one of the two-and-a-half districts referred to by Mr Modi, Pulwama, last month. There, the family of the Pulwama bomber defended his actions, calling it a reaction to the excesses of Indian security forces in the region and a part of the separatist struggle. India says the militancy in Kashmir is fuelled by neighbouring Pakistan, which has armed and trained fighters in the past.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRead the full story.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspVoting has been postponed in the Vellore seat in Tamil Nadu following the seizure of Rs 110 million (£1.22m) in unaccounted cash allegedly from the home of a local opposition politician, Kathir Anand.\u0026nbspHis party accused federal tax authorities of raiding the homes and offices of party leaders running against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u0027s Hindu nationalist party. The governing party in the state, All\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspAnna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), is an ally of Modi\u0027s party.\u0026nbspThe Election Commission said that authorities had recovered 2 billion rupees (£22m) from leaders, workers and supporters of various political parties in the state in the past month. They suspect the money is for buying votes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere has been a minor incident during a news conference at the BJP\u0027s main headquarters here in Delhi, where a member of the audience threw a shoe at the party\u0027s spokesman.\u0026nbspGVL Narasimha Rao was speaking to announce the Hindu nationalist\u0026nbspSadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur as the party\u0027s candidate for Bhopal.\u0026nbspHe was in the process of denouncing Congress for bringing false cases against Hindu activists like Ms Thakur - accused over a 2008 terrorist bomb attack.\u0026nbspThe man who threw the shoe was immediately bundled out of the news conference by security personnel, video of the incident shows. According to the Press Trust of India, the man identified himself as a doctor.\u0026nbspAfter the shoe flew across the stage, Rao immediately suggested it was the act of a Congress-inspired person.\u0026nbspThere are more reports now of violence in West Bengal, following the news earlier that a candidate for CPI(M) had his car attacked by rival workers.\u0026nbspIn Chopra in Darjeeling, police clashed with a group of protesters who alleged that the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in the state, was not allowing them to vote.\u0026nbspOfficials said the agitators threw projectiles at riot police and were met with tear gas shells and baton charges.\u0026nbspAlso in Chopra, reporters said there were clashes at a polling station between TMC and BJP workers, during which some of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) were smashed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDarjeeling is one of only three hotly contested seats in West Bengal voting today. It has been held by the BJP in the past two terms, in what is otherwise a state dominated by regional parties.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTurnout is low in Srinagar even by the standards of the Kashmir valley, where separatists have called a boycott at this and past elections. Officials said just 5.7 per cent of the electorate had turned out by 3pm. For comparison, many seats across the country had passed 30 per cent turnout by 11am.\u0026nbspAnd there have been dozens of minor\u0026nbspclashes there too, between anti-election protesters and police.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOfficers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), India\u0027s armed police presence in Kashmir, have been deployed in many thousands to try and safeguard the vote.\u0026nbspPolice have deployed tear gas to disperse some protests, the Reuters news agency reported. There has been stone pelting by protesters in at least 40 places, said one senior police officer.\u0026nbspStone-pelting has become a weekly ritual in Srinagar, a show of protest\u0026nbspagainst the security forces that usually\u0026nbsptakes place after Friday prayers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe state of Jammu \u0026amp Kashmir is currently operating under governor\u0027s rule and is due a local election to restore a state government, but it was deemed too insecure to carry out state election in tandem with the general election at this time.There may be some violence in Darjeeling but across West Bengal, turnout has been OK.\u0026nbspWith three more hours of voting to go, turnout in the seat of Jalpaiguri - which is reserved for scheduled\u0026nbsp(traditionally downtrodden) caste\u0026nbspcandidates, was up at 71.32 per cent.\u0026nbspIn Darjeeling, it was 63.14 per cent while in Raiganj it was 61.84 per cent.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe state average stands at 65.43 per cent, still with some way to go to reach the 82 per cent turnout of 2014.\u0026nbspIn 2014, the national average was just over 66 per cent -\u0026nbspthat was comfortably the highest turnout in India\u0027s history.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the live blog to load.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It might yet be too late.The genuine stock of sympathy and support commanded by this “bloody dficult woman” evaporated completely on March , her promised date for Brexit.All those reassuring poll leads over Labour turn out to be an illusion, bolstered by Ukip deserters who rallied to the Tories for the  ­General ­Election.They trusted Mrs May in  when she promised “Brexit means Brexit” and in  as she vowed “No Deal is better than a bad deal”. They don’t trust her any more.Both promises were flushed down the pan along with £.billion for a No Deal that never was — and the £million EU elections she insisted would never happen. Not to mention her £billion EU ransom.Staunch Conservatives are ticked off, disgusted to see Mrs May plotting with arch-enemy Corbyn to thwart Brexit, and Chancellor Phil Hammond backing a second referendum before delivering the first.Local party chiefs are on strike. Canvassers steer clear of angry voters. Donors have zipped their wallets and cash has dried up. Meanwhile, recruits flock to Nigel Farage’s new Brexit Party, boosted by the Rees-Mogg “brand” with Jacob’s ­sister, Annunziata, stepping up as a candidate.

That’s why party grandees are spending Easter finding ways to ­dislodge Mrs May’s limpet grip on Number Ten.Leadership rules protect her from another challenge before October. They must be changed.The new leader must be a Brexiteer, which leaves only three viable options — former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ex-Brexit supremo Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Boris is the charismatic vote-winner MPs hope will save their seats. Raab is respected for walking out over Mrs May’s botched Chequers deal. Gove is gathering pace despite staying in Cabinet to back them.Whoever takes over will need to work fast to show the Tories are worth saving — with an emergency voter-friendly boost to the NHS and the fight against crime.They must take on “The Blob”, the anonymous civil ­service mandarins who think they really run Britain.Voters in the  referendum may have believed they were ­fighting faceless, undemocratic and unaccountable bureaucrats who run the EU.They now know Britain too is ruled by faceless, undemocratic and unaccountable bureaucrats who see ­ministers as “here today, gone tomorrow” ­politicians.Our “Yes Minister” civil ­service, not MPs, dictate what is possible, subject to Brussels rules, from schools to state spending, airports to agriculture.They see Britain not as the world’s fth-largest ­economy but a rather absurd ex-empire in managed decline.Margaret Thatcher briefly rooted out this noxious weed in the s.It ed with a vengeance under Tony Blair, breeding nitpicking mandarins such as the late Jeremy Heywood and now Mark Sedwill, who dictate Brexit terms from behind closed doors.Thanks to them, we rushed into Article , capitulated to Brussels, coughed up £billion and ruled out No Deal.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could easier just say ‘Let’s abort this process’.”Or a Tory leader like Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab could scupper talks with the EU after taking over from Mrs May, and lead to a breakdown in negotiations, he predicted.If people were to give commitments that ‘If you give me this job I will reopen the withdrawal agreement, signal that we can’t possibly accept the backstop and take a more robust and bellicose position with Brussels’ – that leads fairly inexorably I think to a breakdown in the talks.Sir Ivan said Mrs May was PM at the most dficult time in Britain since Winston Churchills premiership in .But theres still several years of transition over Brexit to go, he warned.Medium term, long-term, Ive always been optimistic about our future.Mrs May is in talks with Labour over a soft Brexit deal but discussions seem to have stalled."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000478852502.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"frankie boyle capitalism new world order","story":"Which hardly narrows down the field of possibilities, I realise.You’re probably thinking it could be just about anything from ­Question Time or Politics Live to the Twirlywoos or Tree Fu Tom, given the slanted nature of our state broadcaster.So I’ll help you out.It was the final rallying call from a guest on BBC’s New World Order, hosted by Frankie Boyle, whose unlikely transformation into ­comedy’s White Knight of feminism ­continues to put even the reinvention of Piers Morgan as the undisputed saviour of breakfast television into the shade.For just a few short years ago, Frankie was making “jokes” about raping Victoria Pendleton, punching Jessica Ennis-Hill in the stomach and lots of other material that would’ve had the likes of Jim Davidson banned from everything for le.Frankie, though, hates the Tories and Brexit and thinks Jeremy Corbyn is “a decent person”, as terrorist-fawning anti-Semites go.So the BBC’s given him a third series of New World Order, his very own Church Of The Woke, which operates in exactly the same way as the previous two — with four or five guests who must adhere to some fairly strict “group think” rules.One has to be Sara Pascoe, another usually writes for , no one is allowed to be Conservative and there’s a built-in female majority that’s meant to make the BBC look all progressive, inclusive and lovely but doesn’t, because none of them are funny and they all just agree with everything Frankie says.A weekly discussion is built around a topical news event, where pretty much anything abusive and left-wing goes, and facts and truth are usually the first casualties.No space to list all of them here but during this current series I’ve seen Michael Forsyth described as a “Conservative MP” , Liam Fox cited as an example of a Cabinet “forged in British public schools”, even though he’s a council-house boy educated at his local comprehensive, and Frankie claiming Sleaford Mod Jason Williamson was expelled from Labour “during the Harriet Harman purge”.He wasn’t. He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule.

The Democratic Unionist Party called on the Prime Minister to honour a  manesto pledge and preserve the £.-a-year benefit. The Government relies on the DUP’s  MPs for its majority - and the demand comes just months before the two-year pact between the hardline Northern Ireland party and the Conservatives is due for renewal. The DUP could make preserving the perk a key condition in any new deal with the Tories. Party frontbencher Emma Little-Pengelly said: “We believe action must be taken now to prevent the removal of this concession and we strongly urge the Government to step in and ensure this happens.”Labour vowed to work with the DUP and use “every tool” in Parliament to force Mrs May into a screeching U-turn.Currently all households with someone aged  or over are entitled to a free licence. The Conservatives pledged at the  election to maintain the benefit for theof this Parliament, due to run until . But OAPs face being stripped of the perk after the then Tory Chancellor George Osborne stitched up a deal in  to make the BBC responsible for funding the £million-a-year perk from June . Options put forward by the corporation include scrapping them altogether, replacing them with a % concession for all over-s, lting the threshold for eligibility to  or , or means-testing so those who get pension credits are able to claim the benefit. A decision is expected by June.    Writing on the Conservative Home website, Ms Little-Pengelly outlined the case for saving the benefit. “Removing the concession would punish many of the BBC’s most loyal viewers and listeners, particularly the poorest and oldest, many of whom would find it hard or impossible to pay,” she said: “In a fast-changing and uncertain world, my party believes older people need our support more than ever, and that’s why we support the continuation of free TV licences for all over-s. “Some people have however argued that we should use this as an opportunity to means-test the licence fee. “In theory, this sounds like an ideal solution, but in reality it would be expensive to administer, would provide no help for those living just above the line, and many of the poorest would miss out – just as they do on pension credit – because of the complexities and stigma associated with claiming means-testing benefits.” Slamming the “backroom arrangement” thrashed out between ministers and the BBC in , she went on: “Whether they keep it, scrap it, or amend the current funding formula, the BBC would be deciding and implementing social policy.    “This is not the BBC’s job, and what confidence would any of us have that they would perform it well  “The BBC has no experience of this, nor are there the right levels of scrutiny or accountability for their decisions or reasoning.” Ms Little-Pengelly feared pensioners were “inappropriately stuck in the middle of a debate between the Corporation and policy makers about the BBC’s long-term funding future”, adding: “Surely we should keep vulnerable older people out of it.” Labour could highlight isions in Parliament and potentially inflict a symbolic but humiliating defeat on the PM by tabling an Opposition Day debate and forcing a vote. The party’s deputy leader and Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson said: “Emma Little-Pengelly is right - this is going to hit the poorest and most vulnerable hardest. “The Government is outsourcing austerity to the BBC and hoping no one will notice. “Well, we are not having it. “The Tories promised in their last manesto that they would keep free TV licences for over-s and Labour will work with the DUP to use every tool available to us to force them to honour that commitment.” More than , people have signed an Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for the licences to be preserved and more than , readers have backed the Mirror’s campaign, completing coupons in the paper.  Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson and former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown have supported the fight. Age UK Charity Director Caroline Abrahams said: “With the DUP coming out against the abolition of free TV licences for our over-s this means that all the Opposition parties at Westminster want the Government to take back responsibility for funding the policy, so this valued entitlement can keep going. “We trust the DUP and all other parties too will now do everything in their power to persuade the Government to do the right thing by our older population.” National Pensioner Convention general secretary Jan Shortt, said: “The DUP could play a pivotal role in standing up for pensioners by persuading the Government to change its policy on the TV licence. “Now is a crucial time for renegotiating their confidence and supply arrangement and it would be hugely popularthey were to make the Government take back responsibility for funding the TV licence for the over-s.  “It was a ridiculous move by George Osborne in  to make the BBC fund the concession – and now we have a unique chance to stop it from happening. “I hope the DUP can make a stand.” Asked by MPs in September to guarantee licences will remain free, director-general Lord Hall said: “I can’t give you a guarantee it will continue. “The concession, as formulated, comes to an end in June . “We have got to decide what will replace it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mueller report 5 things learned","story":"NewsMueller report:  things we learned from William Barrs bizarre press conferenceDonald Trumps Attorney General denied he was protecting the President - despite having \"disagreed\" with Robert MuellerShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video attorney-general-william-barr-mueller-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAttorney General William Barr gave a spirited defense of Donald Trump at a bizarre press conference ahead of the publication of the Mueller report.

He said Special Counsel Robert Muelleraposs investigation did not uncover evidence that President Donald Trump obstructed the probe of whether he or members of his campaign colluded with Russia during the  presidential election. The deputy attorney general and I concluded that the evidence developed by the special counsel is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense, Barr said during a media conference. Dauntingly, he said the allegations of Russsian meddling are dealt with in Volume one of the final report. There were  occasions where Trump might have obstructed justice - but Barr says he didnapost  Barr said the report details ten episodes involving Trump and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.  President Trump faced an unprecedented situation, Barr said. As he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates. At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the presidentaposs personal culpability. Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion, he added. And he aposdisagreedapos with Mueller about it Barr said he and Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel in May , disagreed with some of the special counselaposs legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law. But at least Trump hasnapost personally taken a marker pen to the report  Barr said none of the redactions made to the report had been made by the White House under executive privilege. Barr said signicant portions of the report could have been kept secret because of a legal doctrine called executive privilege that lets the president withhold information about executive branch deliberations from other branches of government, but were not redacted.

Researchers who carried out a survey into Britons’ spending habits found the much-maligned -s are thrtier than they’re often portrayed. According to the findings, millennials spend just £. per week on coffee - roughly two cups. This is  per cent less than the £. spent by - year-olds. When it comes to hot and cold drinks, lunch and takeaways, the - age group will spend around £ per year more than their younger peers.  And the belief that the younger generation spend a fortune on snazzy lunches has also been dismissed with more than half of - year olds always or often taking a packed lunch to work. The study of Brits’ spending habits was carried out by car manufacturer Dacia, which is now selling its award-winning Sandero supermini for £ per month - the equivalent of around £. per day - on a personal contract hirepackage.    Dacia found just . per cent of Brits thought they could have a new car for between £ and £ per day, with the average adult thinking a new motor would cost almost four timesas much. Ben Fletcher, Head of Dacia UK, said: The findings have shown the younger generation aren’t the frivolous consumers who waste their hard-earned money like some would think. Britain is a nation of financially savvy shoppers who want quality as well as value for money, whether they’re buying a car or a coffee. The research by OnePoll for Dacia found  per cent of Brits thought they would never buy a new car - with seven per cent thinking coffee was a better way of spending £ per day than a new car. It did reveal millennials are twice as likely to regularly pay someone to wash their car. But while they’re thrtier than the - generation, they lag behind over s who are the most sensible with their money. They spend £. on coffee, £. on soft drinks, £. on lunch and £. on takeaways per week -  per cent less than millennials and  per cent less than -s.    The research also found almost one-in-ten Brits admitted they had bought a book over the past year but not read it, with the same figure splashing out on clothes and not wearing them. The Sandero is Europe’s best-selling retail car and has been awarded the title of ‘Best Small Car under £,’ by What Car  for the past seven consecutive years.

Harry and Meghan issued a statement which basically said they would be doing things privately and in their own time - something which extends to introducing Baby Sussex to the world. While this is a disappointment to many, there are plenty of peoplewho agree that the idea of getting gussied up hours postpartum and facing - literally - the whole world is utter madness.    The Duchess of Cambridge managed it admirably, as did the Princess of Wales before her. But while Kate will probably never publicly discuss it, Diana did - and she was searingly honest about the reality of attending such a high-profile photocall. Her comments are likely to only fuel the argument that as traditions go, this one is a little harsh.    In the book  Call Me Diana  by Nigel Cawthorne, Princess Diana describes the moment she introduced Prince William to the world back in . When I left the hospital, I could barely put one foot in front of the other. My stitches were killing me. It was such a strain to stand there and smile even just for a few minutes.

Maundy Thursday is the Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter, with the Queen’s rd birthday falling on Easter Sunday this year. It commemorates the Maundy and Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Apostles.     During the service the Queen, wearing Stewart Pravin, distributed Maundy money to  men and  women - as she will be  this year, celebrating her birthday on Sunday. Each recipient got two purses, one red and one white. Those who received alms were retired pensioners recommended by clergy and ministers of all denominations, in recognition of service to the Church and to the local community. Each recipient receives two purses, one red and one white. This year the Red Purse contains a £ coin, commemorating the th anniversary of the birth of Queen Victoria and a p coin portraying Sherlock Holmes.    Both coins have been newly minted this year. Historically, this sum of £. in the Red Purse is made up of £ for clothing, £. in lieu of provisions and £ which represents a piece of the Sovereign’s gown which, before Tudor times, used to be ided between the Recipients. The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy Money.    This takes the form of one, two, three and four silver penny pieces, the sum of which equals the number of years of the Monarch’s age.  This year ninety-three Maundy coins, which are legal tender, will be distributed. Royal Maundy is one of the most ancient ceremonies retained in the Church of England.

Nine-year-old Jasmine Parker, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, has collected , chocolate eggs for poorly children over the past three years. Each Easter, the kind-hearted youngster personally distributes them to children who are her age or younger at two hospitals and a children’s hospice across the city. Proud mum Maggie Johnston, , said she has very little involvement – as her role is simply to help load the car and to chauffeur her charitable daughter from one location to the next. Baker and mum-of-one Maggie said: “Jasmine has always been kind hearted, so I wasn’t surprised when she was six and asked methe Easter bunny visits children who are in hospital and sick.    “I said ‘no’ and she came up with this brilliant idea that made me gleam with pride, she is naturally so caring.“I put a post on Facebook and she received  eggs from friends and family.“Ever since, she has been known for being the Belfast hospitals’ very own Easter bunny and now she gets a lot more donations every year. “This year,  eggs were donated from Scotland alone and local companies also gave us some – Jasmine was over the moon. “My living room is now full we can’t even sit down on the sofa, but it is so worth it as the children will be amazed and so thankful.  “Jasmine loves helping other people and you can’t wipe the smile off her face when she has given the eggs out on the wards. “It is incredible to see how people come together and donate Easter eggs. All I do is write a Facebook appeal on Jasmine’s behalf which gets shared and I organise a collect point for the donations.” Jasmine took her appeal to another level this year and reached out to people via a radio station to help get more eggs for The Royal Victoria Children’s Hospital, Ulster Hospital and a children’s hospice. Incredible photographs show Jasmine surrounded by ceiling to floor stacked boxes of Easter eggs at the home she shares with Maggie and partner Jay Parker, .  Maggie added: “Last year, there were  donations and my car was a tight squeeze as it was so full. “This year, we will need to use my partner’s car too as they won’t all fit in mine! “Our pride cannot be expressed in words, her enthusiasm to give to others over herself brings a smile to our faces. “We ask ourselves how did we get so lucky to have a beautully kind hearted child.    “Jasmine may have started this butit wasnapost for the generosity of the people of Northern Ireland and further afield it wouldnapost have been as such as a success. “Everyone who donated has helped give a child a smile for Easter which is worth far more than anything . “We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their donations and their kind messages of support and here is to a bigger campaign next year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast britain could","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Britain could see hottest Easter Sunday in  YEARSAfter a relatively cold snap last week, the mercury could reach a sizzling C in some parts - thanks to a plume of hot hair blown in from GreeceShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video easter-bank-holiday-weather-temperatures-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain could be set for the hottest Easter Sunday in  years, as temperatures soar this weekend.

The move has been branded very odd by one parent whose son is studying at The University of Gloucestershire. But the institution has hit back and insists it offered a contribution of up to £, towards a field trip to Las Vegas to attend a world leading technology trade show.The man, who asked not to be named, claimed the university was using the trips as an incentive for getting youngsters to agree to sign up to courses, reports Gloucestershire Live.   He said: “We should have seen the warning signs several years ago when, during an open day, the students were offered an incentive similar to that of a timeshare - sign up now and receive a free trip to Las Vegas.” The man, whose son has been based at one of the university’s sites in Cheltenham since , added: “As an incentive to join the university, students would receive an unconditional place on the courses,they made the University of Gloucestershire their first choice with UCAS. “If students then got the minimal grades at A level, they would then have a free all-expenses-paid trip to Las Vegas.” The parent said a trip to Las Vegas took place last year and although his son did not go on it, about  or  students did. The father believed the university had invested many thousands of pounds on the trip and he felt it should have been spent on other areas of its educational business, which he believed needed considerable improvement. He regarded the money provided for the trip to Las Vegas, which is famed for its casinos and nightle, as “a clear inducement” to those considering becoming students and described the practice as “very odd”.    The university said it did offer money to students to go to Las Vegas but that it was for a field trip. They were able to get up to £, each to go towards the cost of attending a trade show in the American city. Bosses of the uni, which has sites in Cheltenham and Gloucester, said that this yearaposs students could receive £, to go towards field trips in the UK and overseas, accommodation costs, academic books or equipment. In a statement, the university said: “The University of Gloucestershire does not offer ‘free all expenses paid holidays’ overseas to its applicants as an inducement to choosing us as their place of study. We do however make available a range of scholarships awarded on academic merit to eligible students, which entitles them to a financial contribution to activities or equipment that support their learning, such as academic field trips. “Field trips are an integral part of the learning experience for our students on a number of courses across the university, allowing them to put their learning into context outside the lecture hall. In an increasingly global economy, an international field trip, in particular, is an important way for a student to gain a real world understanding of working in their chosen profession overseas.    “However, we are constantly mindful that value for money is a key consideration for our students, and that these optional field trips can represent an additional cost to them, over and above their tuition fees. “Therefore, for  entry, the university had in place the ‘Gloucestershire Scholarship’ rewarding academic merit. For our undergraduate computing courses within the School of Business  Technology, eligible students who achieved a minimum  UCAS tarf points were able to receive the Gloucestershire Scholarship. This scholarship entitled each eligible student to a contribution of up to £, towards a field trip to Las Vegas to attend a world leading technology trade show. “For  entry, the university has in place the ‘Academic Merit Scholarship’ available to students enrolling on undergraduate courses across the university. The terms of this scholarship means that students who achieve a minimum  UCAS tarf points on entry will be eligible to receive £, as a contribution to activities or equipment to support their learning whilst studying at the university. “The Academic Merit Scholarship sum of £, cannot be taken as cash, but can only be used as a contribution to university-organised field trips , accommodation costs, academic books or equipment that supports a student’s chosen field of study.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woolworths bhs old favourites vanished","story":"NewsWoolworths to BHS - the old favourites vanished from our struggling high streetsThe decimated British high street has been haemorrhaging its flagship stores for years, heres a nostalgic reminder of some of our favourites and what happened to themShareByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  APR NewsHigh streets are fighting hard to retain footfall \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe high streetaposs latest casualty, Debenhams, Britainaposs biggest department store, announced it had gone into administration last week, leaving , workers fearing for their jobs.

It befits his status as a Scotland legend and Hall of Fame inductee.#McLeish said: “I am grateful for the opportunity to have managed my country for a second time and leave knowing that I gave my all in the pursuit of success.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/04/5cb6eb4fbbe818.72768578.jpg ","title":"dundee people gig we couldonly have dreamed of","story":"These Dundee Delinquents are heading off on a UK tour which will end with their biggest show to date.Delinquents hit the local music scene in  and original members, vocalist and guitarist David Hennessy and drummer Ryan Hughes, still perform in the group.Andrew Connon, who plays bass and sings backing vocals, joined in September last year.Now the band are heading on tour to celebrate the release of their new EP, Sober on Sunday, kicking off with a headline gig in their home city at Church on Friday.The band have enjoyed many highlights but say the forthcoming tour is something they could “only have dreamed of”.Lead vocalist David said: “There have honestly been so many highlights in our career, including playing at Rebellion Festival and Dundee festivals Book Yer Ane Fest and Punktoberfest.“Gaining fans from bands like Sham  and Stf Little Fingers and being featured in Vive Le Rock magazine was all pretty surreal.“The acclaim that our first album, About Last Night, received still also blows our minds.“Every week is a highlight in this band as we never know what is going to happen next.”Although many bands draw influence from their surroundings, David said the EP is more focused on their personal experiences during the last year.“We made our video in Dundee but our new EP is very much influenced by how insane the last year has been for us,” he said.“Lyrically, it’s like the first half of  when I was drinking and partying too much. Tracks Sober On Sunday, Three Sheets to the Wind and No Disguise were based on me beginning to accept that I couldn’t hide that I was struggling.“Sinners is the saddest song I’ve ever written. That felt like I’d given myself closure from the last six months. It’s a departure but still familiar.”After embarking on the tour on Friday, with doors opening at .pm, the band are heading across Scotland and south of the border.David added: “We have three Scottish dates – Dundee, Edinburgh and Paisley – then we’re off to Blackburn, Nottingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Gateshead.“The last date is Scotland Calling at the O Academy in Glasgow.“I could only have dreamed of playing the O Academy  years ago when I first picked up a guitar so we honestly can’t wait for that.”When it comes to the Dundee music scene, David believes that it has always catered for all tastes.“It’s always been great. It has something for everyone,” he said.“People who complain about it being awful are usually the ones who don’t go to shows.“I don’t get to as many as I’d like but I try to get to as many as I can. It’s top notch.”And following their tour, what’s next for Delinquents “Trying not to die and world domination,” said David."},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside look at Emiratesrsquo huge and luxurious ldquosuperjumbo jet that will

staff have talked through their Hampden agony with “each and every one” of the Aberdeen players this week.The boss and assistant Tony Docherty were sent to the stands, with Lewis Ferguson and Dom Ball also dismissed by referee Craig Thomson, as the Dons fell - to Celtic in the Scottish Cup semi-finals.In the aftermath, McInnes expressed his frustration at the two bookings – for an innocuous trip on the Hoops’ Jonny Hayes and an accidental mid-air collision with Ryan Christie – which saw Ball receive the game’s first red card.The gaffer today revealed how he and his staff have made sure the likes of Ball, and youngsters Ferguson, Dean Campbell and Connor McLennan, are able to turn their focus towards Saturday’s crucial opening Premiership post-split game with Kilmarnock at Rugby Park, with the aim of overhauling Killie in third and securing European football for a sixth successive season.McInnes said: “There wasn’t so much an arm round, but you talk to them inidually about dealing with the frustration and situation of it. We’re there to support each other.“I’m a big believer that you need to show that enthusiasm and positivity among the disappointments.“That’s the test of any team and any person – to try to generate that energy.“There’s a lot to look forward to this season.“A lot of my younger players and senior players, we’ll speak to each and every one of them this week to make sure the focus is there for the remaining games.“It’s important to us and we need to remind ourselves, just because we’ve qualied for Europe for the last five years, it doesn’t become any less special.”If the Reds need a shot of confidence after their cup humbling, they can find it in their away record at Killie.They haven’t tasted defeat there since  and could leap three points clear of their rivals for Europa League qualying with a win.Lewis Ferguson, handed an immediate one-game ban, plus another in next year’s cup, for a reckless tackle on Celtic’s Tom Rogic at Hampden, will miss the league clash.However, skipper Graeme Shinnie – who has held talks with English Championship Derby County and will reportedly seal a pre-contract with Frank Lampard’s Rams this week – willfrom his own suspension.McInnes, who was sent to the stands for reacting to sectarian chanting, said: “It’s important we go into the last five games now and hopefully get the results we want to achieve. It’ll be tough playing against the best teams in the country.“But it’s important every team we play against finds it tough against us and we get the results we’re after.”He added: “It’s clear the improvement in Kilmarnock over the last year or so.“They’ve got a very experienced squad, who have consistently churned out results.“It’s a dficult place to go, but we’ve had a dficult record down there. It’ll be all systems go on Saturday.“There will be a fantastic atmosphere in the ground, probably as good as we’ve seen there, because of the anticipation from their club about getting into Europe.“Hopefully we can generate that ourselves. It’s important we all, players, staff and fans alike, see the importance of Europe for us.“Lewis Ferguson is suspended and we’ve still got injuries. But we’ve got Shinnie back and we’ll try to get a positive result.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41864795-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41864795-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41864795-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.41864795-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dons kids see off atletico madrid 3 1","story":"Aberdeen#s rising stars of the future have defeated Spanish giants Atletico Madrid - in a tournament in Portugal.The Dons’  squad triumphed over Atletico in the IberCup Gold Stage in Portugal.Aberdeen  coach, former Pittodrie player Derek Young, hailed the victory as a “proud day” for his team.Young said: “It was a fantastic result and a well-deserved victory.“We played fantastically well.“We had a lot of chances.

Its close relationship to Lord Of The Rings has been formative in fantasy fiction and that in turn has influenced digital media.“You can see the impact of the medieval theme in character development and game aesthetics, even when they are not directly based in this era.“Here in Aberdeen we have a truly magnicent resource documenting medieval le and so I am delighted to be working to see what this treasure of our city can offer the wider world of game development.”Archivist Phil Astley, of Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire Archives, said: “Bringing st Century technology together with Aberdeen’s unique records will make for a fascinating project, with the potential to open up the registers to a completely new audience.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb074a2914bc2.84707839.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet pepper monkey and shadow are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This timid girl takes time to get to know and trust new people.But Pepper loves treats and this will help a new owner bring her out her shell and build up some trust as she has a sweet nature just waiting to get out.She will need a quiet home with an owner who has the time and patience to help her find her confidence.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"john crawford ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowShinty in Mid Argyll has lost one of its great stalwarts with the passing of John Crawford of Ardrishaig after a short illness.John, aged , died in Mid Argyll Hospital on the evening of Thursday February .John was born and brought up in Minard in Argyll.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella. As a couple they were permanent fixtures at most shinty events in Argyll and well beyond, particularly at events involving young players.Tribute reproduced courtesy of the Camanachd Association"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

Gordon Law took the best spur of the day measuring an impressive cms.There were a few decent whiting around too and a surprising number of dogfish.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14393422.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_090419quivox_01JPG.jpg","title":"celebrate holy week ayrs oldest","story":"NewsCelebrate Holy Week at Ayrs oldest churchThought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  APR NewsSt Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive, Ayr.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHoly Week is celebrated by millions across the globe each year. And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”. Church members meet together and operate between Ayr, St Quivox two churches Auchincruive and Dalmilling Church on Dalmilling Road, Ayr on alternating Sundays. Holy Week Services will be held at Auchincruive each evening at pm until Good Fridayand Easter Sunday funwill begin at .am , with breakfast served in the Crypt at .am and Service start at .am.

But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement. The lease was not terminated earlier due to an administrative error.”   The council shut the Coylton hub  in Spring  along with two other libraries in Dailly and Dundonald to save a projected £, that year.   Coylton villagers waved placards as workers turned up to strip the shelves of books during a tense protest soon.  At the time council head of leisure Jill Cronin said the closure of the Coylton hub was “necessary” to “help the council balance its budget.” She added: We know local people are disappointed about the decision to close the library and we do sympathise.”  The Local Democracy Reporting Service was unable to reach the owner of the library building for comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14420843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elliots2.jpg","title":"first look inside new elliots","story":"NewsFirst look inside the new Elliots as Prestwick firm Buzzworks unveil Vics and the VineBuzzworks have given a glimpse into their brand new venue, which is set to open in early May.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe stylish exterior\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCustomers have been given a sneak peek into the revamped Elliots, which will open its doors next month.

People in isolated properties were on standby to run for their lives as the fierce blaze engulfed hillsides. Residents and anglers had packed up valuables and were prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice overnight on Saturday. A major power line was also in danger of being engulfed before the helicopters doused the surrounding grass. The scale and speed of the fire - swept on by mph winds and tinderbox grass and heather - shocked rescuers. People as far away as Maybole had to close their windows as the smoke blew in. One resident said: “It was really, really scary. I have never experienced anything like it. The fire was everywhere and we were ready to leave.” And forest steward Archie McNeillie revealed: “If we did not have the helicopters I hate to think what have happened.” Ten square miles of moor, from the head of Loch Doon to the upper banks of Ayrshire’s water supply Loch Bradan, was destroyed.    Fortunately the nest site of the Loch Doon ospreys was nowhere near the flames. The main forest drive between Loch Doon and the Falls of Stinchar is credited with halting the fire’s spread south. At the one point it jumped the drive but the flames were beaten by the Carrick Lane river. Dead grass and several weeks of dry weather gave vast amounts of fuel to the fire. There is no grazing or controlled burning, which would have prevented spread, in the area. Flames came within yards of destroying the play park which overlooks Loch Riecawr. They wiped out a lecking spot for black grouse and could have claimed the lives of young birds, rabbits and deer. Fortunately only a small percentage of the valuable timber crop was damaged. Several fishing lodges were at risk of being in the path of the flames.  Forestrymen directed aircraft to dump the water, lted from Loch Skelloch, to protect these and other rural buildings. Archie McNeillie, area warden for Forestry and Land Scotland, was among nine staff called out to help at first light on Sunday. A staffer from Dalmellington was first to get called out to investigate with fire and police on Saturday night. But he said: “It was clear from the start this was bigger than anything we could handle. “The wind was so strong and we could not control it manually. That’s when we got the copters in. “The area is huge,  square kilometres.”  Archie, who starred in the BBC series The Forest with his sidekick John ‘Cool’ Coughtrie, said  per cent of the damage was open moorland. He said: “There are some trees damaged by the fire. “The fire was funnelling up the river from Loch Doon to Ballochbeaties and came into a pinch-point.

Scottish Government bosses said work on the A, which will cost £. million, is now ready to proceed. It follows the official award of a construction contract to Willis Bros Civil Engineering. The project will create a .-mileroad designed to ease the burden of traffic thundering through the tight confines of Maybole. Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson, said: The local community will benefit from opportunities created for small and medium enterprises to bid for subcontractor roles and the provision of at least four vocational and seven professional, site-based training opportunities. The contractor anticipates that the project could employ up to  people during the months of peak construction activity, a number of which are created by the project.

The new bypass will benefit drivers on the A and opens the way for new investment and redevelopment in Maybole.It is disappointing that the Scottish Government chose not to fully dual the bypass, missing an opportunity to futureproof the road, but it’s still a major step forward for the area.This is an important investment but there’s much more that could be done to improve the A along its entire . Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish water insists ayrshire drinking","story":"NewsScottish Water insists Ayrshire drinking supply is safe following concerns over taste and odourBosses at Scottish Water say the supply throughout Ayrshire is still safe to drink.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsScottish Water has ruled out health concerns \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshireaposs drinking water IS safe to consume, officials at Scottish Water insisted today.

The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow

She started by telling us that her vaccination was in the thigh, as it was for other girls, so that it didnrsquot mar the upper arm, just in case that girl, might later in le, wear a sleeveless evening dress - how thoughtful of the doctor! We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation.

The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese. There was no thought to what we were eating.ldquoWe now eat better with lots of fresh fruit and veg, and have more thought in what we are preparing and eating and are both enjoying our food much better.He added: ldquoA big tick to myself is that I can now buy jeans in Primark ndash something I was not able to do before.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"trios-delight-at-being-named-members-of-scottish-youth-parliament","story":"Adnan Ros and Nathaniel de Havilland will represent East Lothian, with Erin Campbell representing Midlothian North and Musselburgh.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

And, as her quarter of a million Twitter followers will attest, only tennis ranks above her love of cakes. So, although she didnrsquot elaborate on the outcome of the altercation, I can only imagine Ms Murray volleyed back as good as she got and ended up persuading the shop to accept Euros, groats and Monopoly money as well as Scottish cash.The tweet got so much traction because most Scots know and understand exactly how this interaction goes, just how grim and maddening it is no matter how many times yoursquove experienced it. These days many of us feel much more confident in our skins as Scots and are able to consider and reconcile our relationship with our English neighbours in more mature and expansive ways than ever before. But you still canrsquot escape the deep, primeval humiliation of having your money refused. And although this refusing is often down to ignorance rather than malice, especially in London, where so many of those who work in shops, restaurants and cafes are from overseas and donrsquot even know what a Scottish note is ndash why would they  - itrsquos something we Scots just canrsquot seem to get over.

To give him his due, Irsquod usually get a wink and a free drink, too.The irony of all this, of course, is the fact that the banknotes so many of us defend to the end at cash desks all over England, day in, day out, are not legal tender at all. Not even in Scotland, as it turns out, where only coins have legal weight. According to the Bank of England, both coins and Bank of England notes are legal tender south of the border, with anything  a ldquomatter of agreement between the parties involved. This means each and every one of those painful refusals was legitimate, every ldquoput that in your pipe and smoke it, pal righteous speech made by you was nonsense.

Whether that makes the shock greater is irrelevant: the loss and sorrow are the same. The rapid response of Parisians spoke of the deep place Notre Dame holds in Francersquos psyche. ldquoIt was Parisrsquos lighthouse, said one, indicating that this marvel of medieval gothic architecture was the brightest of all beacons in the famous city of lights. ldquoIt is our history, our literature, our imagination, said President Emmanuel Macron, vowing ldquowe will rebuild Notre Dame together.All of us who have visited Paris have made a bee-line for this remarkable, forbidding place, which perhaps explains why its destruction has touched people across the world. Notre Dame, home of Victor Hugorsquos tender-hearted hunchback, Quasimodo, is to Paris what Edinburgh Castle is to the capital: a massive, seemingly immovable monument, witness to centuries of turbulent affairs. Both have represented an unchanging presence around which tides of revolutions and revolts, war and politics have washed.As it lies in partial ruin, Notre Dame is being talked of as part of Francersquos soul. Yet this -year-old building carries meaning far beyond the countryrsquos border. It was here that Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned, and Joan of Arc beatied, but it was also the scene of Henry VI of Englandrsquos coronation as King of France, when he was a child. More than a century later, on April  , , Mary Stuart was married beneath its graceful soaring roof to Francis, the dauphin, son of Henri II. By all accounts it was an eye-wateringly extravagant event. A large theatrical stage was built outside the cathedral, and inside there was a massive triumphal arch. As weddings went, it was the most spectacular Notre Dame had ever witnessed.Read more: Macron vows to rebuild cathedralI doubt therersquos a country in Europe whose history has not crossed with the cathedralrsquos at some point. In certain respects, it is the most venerable symbol of an emerging Europe, a fulcrum for events that have made the continent what it is today. No wonder crowds watching the inferno from the Icircle de la Citeacute or on television wept.The largest of its  bells, Emmanuel, shares its name with the president. This coincidence might just prove fateful. Mr Macron rushed to the scene before the fire wholly engulfed the roof and spire. It is a little ironic that, as the flames took hold, he cancelled a recorded speech due to be broadcast at eight that evening. This statement was intended to restart his first term in office, and go some way towards appeasing the gilets jaunes movement, which has badly damaged his credibility and his countryrsquos stability.Doubtless he postponed because of the gravity of the unfolding disaster. Even so, Mr Macronrsquos emotional proclamation late into the night, in which he pledged to see the cathedral restored to glory, might prove to have been a masterly stroke.It is too cynical to suggest that even as the fire blazed the president understood that this crisis could improve his standing. But the political fall-out might nevertheless work to his advantage. In a way that no prepared script could, the presidentrsquos response to the fire, and his assurance that ldquotogether the cathedral will be rebuilt, will have won him new friends and admirers. He might have misjudged the national mood when handling the gilets jaunesrsquo demands, but on the night when Notre Dame burned, he too was ablaze. Instinctively he gauged the depth of feeling this place rouses in the people he governs. That affection, and the profound heritage the cathedral represents, crosses political, ideological and class ides. The wealthy of the Bouled Saint Germain feel the same in this matter as their compatriots in downtrodden rural France.If anything could unite people across the board, it is the sight of the countryrsquos best-loved building wreathed in blood-orange smoke. Some will doubtless see this calamity as a warning or sign, as when York Minster went on fire. Certainly, the potency of the pictures of such a blaze is primitive. You cannot fail to respond, nor to feel a passing shiver of superstition that, at this exceptionally troubled and uncertain time in Europe, it holds a message of some kind.For Mr Macron, that message might simply be that Notre Dame is a symbol of what unites the nation, an olive branch of sorts. In promising without hesitation to secure its future, he was committing also to hold together the France of liberteacute, eacutegaliteacute and fraterniteacute.It might not be the speech he expected to deliver, but it mayprove to be the finest he has yet made."},{"url":null,"title":"why-tiger-the-comeback-kid-is-a-sight-to-shout-about","story":"Woods winning the  Masters at Augusta was a picture of sheer joy. In true showman style he started off with a near miss, adding to the already heart-pounding drama. But then it happened, the ball fell into the hole, the penny dropped, and just like that his time on the wrong side of fame was over. He took it easy at first, just one arm pumping the air, but who was he kidding  There was too much there to contain. Too much relief, hurt, gratitude, happiness. He threw his arms wide, looked up to the heavens, and screamed.:A comeback for the agesHe howled with delight again when his son ran into his arms, Woods holding him the way his dad held Tiger  years before when he won his first Masters. Back when everything was ahead of him, when he could do no wrong. What scenes. From presidents past and present to fellow champions including Serena Williams, the congratulations have poured in. Woodsrsquo achievement at Augusta has been hailed as the greatest comeback in sporting history, quite a claim in a field that contains Ali and Lauda to name but two. It is more than that, though. The joy millions have taken in histo form shows the continuing power of the comeback as an idea. We want to believe in it. We need to believe in it.From the moment he appeared on television at the age of two, winning a putting contest with Bob Hope, Woods has lived in the glare of the cameras. His talent led to fame and more money in sponsorship deals than any athlete had earned before. Between  and  he won  majors and was on course to beat Jack Nicklausrsquos record of .Then his car hit a fire hydrant and his le was exposed as a wreck. He apologised to his we ndash on camera, naturally ndash for a series of affairs and casual encounters. His we gave up on him, understandably, and his body followed. From being an athlete in his prime, Woods was felled by pain in his knees and his back. Operations followed, as did an addiction to pain pills, culminating in his arrest in  for driving under the influence. The police mugshot, never among the most flattering of images, was particularly cruel, showing Woods as a bloated, weary mess, one, moreover, who still seemed to reek of arrogance. It looked like the photo equivalent of some blowhard asking ldquoDo you know who I am  and it earned Woods even more enemies than he had already accrued.:Sports greatest taleDespite the adulation which surrounds him after his win in Augusta, Woods still has enemies and critics, some of whom took to social media after he won the Masters to askthis great guy hugging his family was the same serial adulterer and spoiled brat of a few years ago. It has also been pointed out how lucrative Woodsrsquo comeback will be for himself and his sponsors. Great for the game of golf, too. It might be the whitest sport on the planet, butit has a place for Tiger then all is forgiven, right Looking at the hostility Woods ignites in some quarters it is hard not to think he is being unfairly held to higher standards than others, and that this is due not in large part to his riches or talents but to his colour. One only had to glance at the crowd of spectators cheering him on his way on Sunday to see what what a rarity Woods, an American of black, Native American, Asian and Caucasian heritage, is at the upper levels of golf. In a country that remains as ided on race as America it was something of a miracle he ever got as far as he did. When he fell from grace, as many others had done before him, the backlash was particularly brutal, even for the modern media age. It was ashe had to be punished, not just for what he had done, but for being insufficiently grateful for the status and riches he had been accorded.:Can Woods break new ground It might be thought that none of this matters any more now that Woods has joined that most elite of clubs, the comeback kids. For some, however, there is no such institution. A person might be seen to recover from the most dreadful setbacks and failures, but they are never fully allowed to forget them. Will Bill Clintonrsquos name, for example, ever be mentioned in the history books without Monica Lewinskyrsquos being far behind  As for Ms Lewinsky, she is proof of how membership to the club is only granted to those, mostly men, who meet certain criteria. Women by and large donrsquot have comebacks. They survive. They endure.Those who do not believe in second acts usually quote F Scott Fitzgerald to bolster their case. Erroneously, as it turns out. While the line about there being no second acts in American lives is usually attributed to his unfinished novel of , The Last Tycoon, it in fact originated in an earlier essay, My Lost City, and it reads: ldquoI once thought that there were no second acts in American lives, but there was certainly to be a second act to New Yorkrsquos boom days. If even the writer most associated, however mistakenly, with naysaying second acts was a believer, who are we to doubt As for those who question whether Woods should be treated as a hero again just for winning a golf tournament, what is the weather like up there on the moral high ground  It is not just sport that needs great comeback tales. What a bleak, devoid of hope, le it would be to think that things and people and luck cannot change, that there were no second chances for anyone. Sport shows us what a comeback looks like in a spectacular sense, but every day millions quietly stage their own fightbacks big and small. People do not come back from grief, illness and misfortune because of multi-billion dollar sponsorship deals or the acclaim of millions. Putting one foot in front of another again is the purest expression of our will to live,not for ourselves then for others.That we take such pleasure in seeing people bounce back is one of humanityrsquos finer instincts, something to be celebrated, an act to shout, or scream, about.

Some pound will be offered every two years to fund travel and accommodation costs.The latest conference is being organised by conflict history and archaeology PhD researchers Euan Loarridge and Mr Conaghan will be held in October. Mr Conaghan is the first member of his family since his great-uncle to go to the University of Glasgow.He said: ldquoUncle Hughie was like a father to my grandfather.

He was the first in our family to go to University. It was just unfortunate that his time at the university was interrupted by war.

He and his crew had carried out nine successful missions in their Lancaster bomber.But on their th mission to bomb Cologne in June , their luck ran out. Their bomber was spotted by German night fighter ace Wilhelm Herget and was so badly damaged in the skirmish it crashed a short while later.All but two of the crew perished. While four of the five bodies of the crew were recovered, the body of the pilot was never found.The pilotDr Iain Banks, senior lecturer in history and battlefield archaeology and Mr Conaghanrsquos PhD supervisor, said: ldquoThe work Marc and a fellow Glasgow graduate Emile Picard have done on his great-unclersquos WW story has identied the exact crash site location.\"Marc and Emilie cross-referenced  WW reports and aerial photos with maps of the area today. This work has led to the crash site now being formally recognised by the Dutch government in its approved list of WW archaeological investigations sites.ldquoWe believe thatwe can locate the cockpit, we may find the remains of the pilot and be able to solve the mystery of his final resting place for his family.ldquoIdeally we would love that staff and students from Glasgow be able to be involved in digging this important site and we hope we will manage to lever in suitable funding to do this."},{"url":null,"title":"2019 true origins festival to bring the best of scottish gin to lochter","story":"A new festival celebrating Scottish craft gin and showcasing  dferent gins from across the country is to be held at Lochter Activity Centre this weekend.With UK gin sales doubling in the last five years, the popularity of gin shows no sign of slowing.Try an old favourite or find a new tipple of choice at the festivalIt was a combination of this and a love for the quintessential British drink that inspired Banchory brothers Guy and Mungo Finlayson to bring the very best of local gin to consumers as well as creating their own bespoke gin brand, which was launched at their London festival in November .The brothers run MFGF Events and organise the annual Banchory and Inverurie Beer Festivals, which have also featured gin in recent years.Spearheaded by a passion to celebrate the very best in Scottish gin, based on quality and authenticity, the pair launched True OriGINs – the Scottish Gin Festival in London last year.Following the huge success of the London event, which attracted more than , visitors over four days, the Finlayson brothers announced plans for a series of festivals across Scotland, bringing the very best in Scottish gin back to its home.The festivals, which have already visited Banchory and Edinburgh promise a unique experience to discover the many gins that Scotland has to offer.As well as a wide and expansive selection of locally curated gins, the True OriGINS festivals has also launched Guy and Mungo’s very first gin, Autumn.Offering up to  gins sourced from across Scotland, each bottle and glass served has a story and every story has its own explanation.

More staff will be available to assist residents and advise on the best suitable container for their waste.This increase in customer service was trialled in , with a % increase in recycling, and will be rolled out to recycling centres to help increase recycling rates and decrease waste disposal costs.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The three glamping pods at Aden Caravan and Camping Park have been popular with guests\"  Directors sought for Park viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Ros Baxter, Waste Manager, said: “These improvements to HWRCs are intended to provide an equitable level of service for all communities within existing budgets. “We hope the recycling rate will increase at each site, which will in turn reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill by the area as a whole, potentially saving money which can then be reinvested.”Matt Davis, Disposal Team Manager, added: “The majority of the area’s HWRCs are well used and all local communities are within relatively easy reach of one, so we hope we will see people making good use of them into the future.“As well as providing additional local employment, the increase in customer service should be noticeable, with a knock-on effect for recycling rates while reducing materials sent to landfill.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is .%, but services currently available should allow a rate over %.\"Sending waste to landfill costs much more than recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new homes planned for kemnay","story":"Plans have been tabled for  new houses # including five affordable homes # on the outskirts of Kemnay.Malcolm Allan Housebuilders Ltd wants to build the properties on land at Milton Farm opposite the village’s golf course.The site is currently designated for development in the Aberdeenshire Local Development Plan .In a supporting statement, agents Suller and Clark say the layout has been carefully considered to provide a mix of house types, sizes and tenures, with a loop road through the site linking to an existing residential development to its north, which will provide for both road and pedestrian traffic.They says the house designs are “broadly traditional” in terms of design, proportions and materials and will be set within a generously landscaped site.“The site is in a sustainable location, with good links to the village core, to community facilities such as schools, the academy, recreation facilities and retail outlets,” states their report.“The layout and designs have been carefully considered to ensure the highest quality design and materials, that the buildings sit within the containment offered by the site, whilst adding to the strategic landscape and recognising that this is an important and distinctive approach to Kemnay.”Although the applicants say issues pertaining to potential flooding at the site are now resolved, SEPA has meantime lodged an objection to the plans in the absence of a full risk assessment.It says that parts of the application site could be at risk of medium to high risk of flooding.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Duncan Harley with Michael Stuart at the launch of The Little History of Aberdeenshire\"  Book launch success for local author viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"fraserburgh charity to launch new service","story":"A Fraserburgh charity is preparing to launch a brand new service.Listening support charity Y Suffer in Silence will soon offer Walking Talking Therapy sessions alongside its current support services.Speaking to the Herald, chair of Y Suffer in Silence, Paul Greenall, said: “Some people may want to reach out to us but have a fear of coming into our building.“By providing this new service we can take away that anxiety and provide support at the same time.“People may also be more willing to talk about their feelings while out on a walk somewhere.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Companies in Scotland are caught in a pincer movement of business challenges.“On one hand, businesses are faced with increased cost pressures due to currency weakness and higher wages, and on the other they are hit by the dampening effects of political turmoil caused by the ongoing uncertainty of our future relationship with the EU.“There is an immediate urgency to deal with Brexit, which is hampering our ability to compete on the international stage. We see this borne out in the decline in confidence, dficulties in recruitment and challenges in exporting. “Furthermore, restraint on plans to invest will do nothing to solve Scotland’s ongoing productivity challenge which requires sustained levels of investment in skills and trainingwe are to see the sht the economy needs.”The SCC’s quarterly economic indicator is Scotland’s longest running survey of its kind, operating since . Its latest findings come just two days after it was revealed Scotland’s unemployment figures had reached a record low at . per cent.Mr Allan added: “Our survey has shown some real areas of robustness which highlights the resilience of Scottish businesses and their resolve to stay focused on creating jobs and paying taxes to fund vital public services. But the pressure on Scottish firms is rising, with the prospect of increased costs due to inflation, currency volatility, Brexit preparations and the prospect of increased taxation remaining as top concerns for all sectors.”Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: “The lack of clarity about the UK’s terms of exit from the EU continues to cast a shadow over day-to-day decision making, with businesses clearly struggling to make long-term plans in such times. Weak business investment has been a feature of recent times, and this latest survey shows that firms are becoming even more reluctant to make investment decisions at this present time. “This is an unwelcome sign given the key role that investment plays in boosting productivity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn.

That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be .

Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .My final word here . Given a choice of Nigel Farage, Johnathon Wills or Gary RobinsonI would choose Farage without question. Ex Councillors with a history of outright dishonestyor complete turncoat behaviour , Farage for me warts and all, any time.I do not agree with all Farage has done and said, but I find no lack of integrity in him, which in the atmosphere of today#s politics is refreshing.I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat.

Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test.

The facilitators offer advice and support to help you make changes to your lestyle and I quickly realised I was eating all the wrong foods and also too much of them. I’m six weeks into the programme and I’ve already lost a stone, I’m feeling better, my concentration levels have heightened and I feel fitter and well. I would urge everyone to go on the programme. It literally has changed my le.”Diabetes UK assistant director for local impact, Dr David Chaney, said: “We only have to look at the startling yearly increase in number of people being diagnosed with type  diabetes to know that we cannot ignore this very serious condition.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed 20 northern ireland council officials earning more than 100k","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

TaxPayers Alliance has criticised the high remuneration.Its chief executive John OConnell said: \"The average council tax bill has gone up by more than £ over the last  years and spending has gone through the roof.\"Disappointingly, many local authorities are now responding to financial reality through further tax rises and reducing services, rather than scaling back top pay.\"Despite many in the public sector facing a much-needed pay freeze to help bring the public finances under control, many town hall bosses are continuing to pocket huge remuneration packages, with staggering payouts for those leaving their jobs.\"There are talented people in the public sector who are trying to deliver more for less, but the sheer scale of these packages raises serious questions about efficiency and priorities.\"The next highest-earning council chiefs were Liam Hannaway and Roger Wilson, chief executives of Newry, Mourne and Down, and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon respectively.Mr Hannaway received £,, including £, for his pension and £ in expenses, while Mr Wilson was paid £,, including £, in pension contributions.NILGA, the organisation that represents local government here, said pay packets \"were numerically and proportionately lower on many levels\" when compared with salaries paid in Wales, England and Scotland.It added: \"Senior officer leadership and resilience is crucial for the  councils in Northern Ireland, and senior officers now require signicant skills and competencies.\"Versatile, motivated and productive people delivering high quality, affordable services is the very least the public deserves.\"As a recent independent review of chief officers pay in Northern Ireland showed, after market testing, our pay rates for this group are in keeping with what is needed to retain and recruit.\"No increases therefore were recommended in Northern Ireland.\"Its pleasing that all NIs councils have adopted this prudence, despite the new pressures faced by

Commissioner Drew Harris says a culture of suspicion could be the root cause. Says that previous scandals harmed connection between rank and file and the larger organisation.— aoe-grace moore.April , Members are expected to sign up to uphold the law, behave with honesty and integrity, respect, privacy, transparency and speak up when they see wrongdoing.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told a public meeting with the Policing Authority board on Thursday that % of the , gardai who have received training on the code of ethics had not yet signed the code.“I’ve made it clear it’s entirely unacceptable,” Mr Harris told the meeting.“Whatever concerns there might have been in the initial implementation have long been dealt with, and we have provided training and necessary intervention.“If you want to progress anywhere in the organisation, you have to sign up to the code of ethics.“It is disappointing, but I have written already, we’ve done a video, and I would look to associations for leadership as well, they too have a responsibility.”Mr Harris said the lack of uptake was at odds with what he has observed in many stations, but he looks to the PwC audit for the reasons behind the lack of uptake.The force had undergone a number of scandals in previous years including  breath test figures, missing homicide data, issues with the finances at Templemore training college and the Disclosures Tribunal regarding the treatment of whistleblowers.Mr Harris says it is clear that this had an effect on rank and file officers’ trust in the senior administration.“People didn’t really identy with the larger organisation, they viewed it with some suspicion,” he said.“I think it’s against that backdrop and that period in which the Gardai had been through contentious issues and coverage in the media, that loosened the connection between people and the larger organisation.“The challenge is trying to break that, and have people identy a little less with their close colleagues and more with what the organisation is trying to do.“The cynicism that saps away enthusiasm is a concern, people have ious reasons for not signing, and we’ve tried to address those, with some success.“I’d be concerned about the manner in which any probationer Gardai is mentored when they’re first sent out, and wary of that cynicism they could be exposed to.“Those are important years in formulating an inidual’s career.“When I go out to stations mostly unannounced, I’m always taken by the quality of people,” Mr Harris added.“I can’t understand how % of these people haven’t signed the code of ethics.“More analysis may help, but it does hit oddly with my own personal experience with the people.”Mr Harris, the former deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland , took up the Garda top job in September .He was appointed in hopes of overhauling the force after An Garda Siochana had come under intense scrutiny in the years previous, and was labelled as in dire need of reform."},{"url":null,"title":"elon musk becomes absolute unit in picture swap with english museum","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

closure","story":"Parents and schoolchildren from Groarty Integrated P.S. this week hand delivered letters to education chief, Derek Baker, imploring him to reverse a decision on its proposed closure.The group gathered outside the Guildhall in the cold as the Permanent Secretary from the Department for Education met a cross-party delegation inside.The meeting follows a motion proposed by SDLP Councillor Shauna Cusack stating that it recognised “local schools are facing unprecedented financial pressures following real reductions in core funding for education, to the sum of £ per pupil over the last number of years.”There was disappointment amongst the parents and young people when it was decided that Mr Baker would not come outside to personally address their concerns.Instead, it was agreed that one parent, Leanne Brown, would enter the Mayor’s parlour on behalf of the group to present Mr Baker with letters written by children from the Coshquin-based school.She hopes Mr Baker will take time to digest the messages and pictures drawn by children which express their “love” for the school, and that they will inform his decision.Speaking outside the Guildhall on Tuesday, Ivan Peoples, who attended the school as a pupil and now has a child in primary , said he came along to voice his concerns to decision-makers.“I thought the whole future of Northern Ireland was to integrate both sides of the community and I don’t understand why they’d want to close the only one they have on the West Bank.“Foyle College has already moved to the Waterside, and the only other school we have in the city is Oakgrove, and for us to travel over there could cause problems.  If it’s a windy day the bridge can be closed.“The school is integrated in more than just religion, there are people with additional needs, and I think it teaches young people to be caring towards people with needs and can help prevent bullying further down the line.“It was a small school when I was there and I don’t see why they should close it now when there is going to be so much development around it.”Martina McCourt’s son Michael is the most recent pupil to enrol at Groarty P.S. after she decided the school was best-placed to meet his “complex needs”.“Because the school he was at was so big there weren’t enough staff to cater for his needs.“The staff there are fantastic and they picked up on things straight away, certain traits in class, and when I was expressing concerns they were in agreement.“I’m only finding out myself that there are pupils with dferent needs, some with severe needs, and each one of them is being catered for as an inidual and they all accept each other.“It’s just like a wee family and I love it.  He’s coming on great.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“My niece also went to Groarty and she has excelled since.“I would ask the Education Authority to please reconsider because every child deserves a chance.”‘Unique’Independent Councillor Sean Carr organised for the parents to attend after meeting them at the school last week.“We’re very disappointed that the parents didn’t get to meet the permanent secretary.  Some of the young people wanted to read their letters to him.“If you read some of the stories they’re a powerful testimony of the school and hopefully he will read them now.“There would have been no hassle, a few parents and children wanted to have their say, so it’s very disappointing.“The school has been there for quite some time and children who have left bigger schools have thrived at Groarty P.S., that is what we need, and it is unique in this part of the world.“I’d like to see the school retained and a new build for that school which at one stage they were promised with all the new development around Skeoge.”Meanwhile, Independent Councillor Darren O’Reilly, was at the meeting with Mr Baker and he said ious points were aired about the pressures faced by parents, principals and frontline workers.“There needs to be pressure politically and people need to take direct action like we’ve seen today.  More of that is needed to put pressure onKaren Bradley.“Our school system is in a serious mess, a crisis, and I don’t think the Tories are too worried about wains in Derry.  We need to make sure they know and the only way to do that is to campaign.“All the parties were unied in saying schools need more resources and Groarty P.S. needs to be protected.”Ultimately, any final decision regarding the future of Groarty Integrated P.S. has to be taken by a minister, ordevolved institutions are still suspended, by the permanent secretary at the Department of Education by January .The

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated. A special mention to chairman Michael Mulholland for organising the transport to the final.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison,Andrew Mulholland , William Edgar, Stuart Hunter, Matthew Martin, Alex Millar, Jason Campbell, Scott Leetch, Luke Curry, Michael Carney, Steven Crean, David Marshall, Josh Higginson.Man of the match: William Edgar.Ballynahinch Limerick IRISH HOCKEY CHALLENGE CUP FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Archaeological dig uncovers skeletons dating back to 8th century  ","story":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL material found at Downpatrickrsquos Cathedral Hill dates back as far as  years after the birth of Jesus.Work from a Queenrsquos University Belfast team of archaeologists has dated skeletons buried some  years later, indicating a sizeable community living in Downpatrick at the time.The material was recovered during last Augustrsquos four-week excavation and community investigation which attracted , visitors from around the world.Local volunteers played a major role in uncovering the history of the site and there is another opportunity to get involved in another dig.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin is urging local people, particularly students, to get involved in another dig which is to take place this August.ldquoI visited the archaeological dig on Cathedral Hill several times in August last year and was impressed by the community involvement, the volume of tourist visits and of course the incredible finds being made from our rich early Christian and medieval past, just a stonersquos throw from the traditional site of St Patrickrsquos grave, he said.ldquoItrsquos exciting to hear about the new discoveries that are being made and the Early Christian dates of some of the finds, and I am delighted to announce that a second season of excavation is to be funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body for this August, as part of its PEACE IV Programme, when young people between  and  will be invited to take part in the dig for at least four days. Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

I know several who are now no longer able to do that. Why not leave it so everyone can participate  We have raised this point with the organisers.”He added: “Increasingly there are sporting and social events on a Sunday. We would have a higher view of a Sunday, that it is the Lord’s Day from start to finish.“There’s a growing trend of secularisation. Christians are told ‘sorry mate, we hear what you’re saying but society has moved on’. Sadly, when it comes to religionthere’s a certain type of religious view then it’s disregarded.“There is a determination in the minds of some people to remove the Christian foundations of society.

And some were the wrong colour. Once the smoke had cleared, their lives didnrsquot matter much.The blaze at Notre Dame appears to have been accidental. But the Grenfell tragedy was not only forseeable but had been foreseen.Residents had complained about the fire hazard to Kensington council ndash to no effect.The flats had been built on the cheap and then wrapped around with killer material.The cathedral of Notre Dame is a cultural treasure. Dismay at its destruction was inevitable and understandable. The impulse to restore it to its former glory is right and proper.However there is a question regarding priorities here which has largely been lost sight of.Theresa May took to Twitter to ldquounderline our solidarity with France and her people. But she hasnrsquot shown much solidarity with the people of Grenfell Tower.Her pledge to the Grenfell families that they would all be housed in suitable accommodation within three months has simply been forgotten.Of course, she didnrsquot mean it in the first place.Just as the super-rich who coughed up a billion in no time at all for Notre Dame all kept their hands in their pockets when it came to the people of Grenfell.Eamonn McCannbullEamonn McCann is the former Foyle MLA for the party People Before Profit Alliance, and a longstanding left-wing commentatorIreland has no need to feel grateful to Britain Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinRat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant -

July  celebrationsAlongside Ballymena, the capital stages a Twelfth demonstration every year.Other sizeable parades will take place in Lisnaskea , Pomeroy , Coleraine , Larneand Rathfriland \", says the statement.Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, Edward Stevenson, hailed the enhanced cultural experience offered by the yearly celebrations. “Once again this summer, the signicance of Orange traditions will be underlined by the scale of our parades,” he said.“Surely there is no other event on these islands that can bring such vast numbers of people onto the streets to enjoy our processions, either by taking part or simply to watch them go by. It is a custom which has been maintained for over  years, passed through generations, and will continue to be upheld for many years to come.”Mr Stevenson will be in attendance at the Ballyronan demonstration.The senior Orangeman added: “We continue to welcome an increasing number of international visitors to our celebrations who are keen to experience first-hand the spectacle of the biggest day in the parading calendar. “High calibre music provided by some of the finest marching bands will only add to the festival atmosphere. We look forward to another glorious Twelfth.”The  demonstrations on Friday  July , will be held in: Tandragee Belfast Lisnaskea Pomeroy Donemana Augher Coleraine Ballyronan Holywood Crossgar Rathfriland Kilkeel Larne Glenavy Carnlough Ballymena Ballymoney and Ahoghill.Northern Ireland electricity grid can now be run from state-owned Dublin control roomWarning that Northern Ireland farm subsidies could halve by  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingStricken Isle of Man TT racer Steve Mercer says it cant end like thisThese are the  bizarre items you can take on a plane from Belfast International AirportMan dies after three vehicle collision on NI roadlsquoIrsquoll stab you in your pregnant bellyrsquo, child tells NI teacherBomb scare in N.I. housing estate -

He stated: ldquoIt is my understanding that a mayor should not use their position to promote any political message.Mr Wilson has made a formal complaint to the council and asked why the event was allowed to take place.He added: ldquoI am also aware that one of the speakers referred to lsquothe memory of our patriot dead across Counties Derry and Antrimrsquo and how lsquotheir ultimate sacrice continues to inspire us daily on our path to Irish unityrsquo.ldquoThat is not referring to the dead of  who were nowhere to be seen in counties Londonderry and Antrim. The people of Coleraine and the surrounding areas are only too well aware of the murderous and criminal deeds of the type of republican lsquopatriotsrsquo which Sinn Fein are so fond of eulogising.Mr Wilson highlighted the IRA bombing of Coleraine in , in which six pensionerswere killed.He added: ldquoIn  the bombers ed and levelled the town centre.

The seniors school can be found on Hickman Road, the juniors and nursery a short distance on in Victoria Road.School facilities include a full gym, a library, an IT suite, a sports hall, science laboratories, and nearby access to local sports facilities including athletics track, Penarth RFCrsquos rugby pitch and the International Sports Village in Cardf Bay.Traditionally the school was strictly boys only. However, in the mid s the decision was taken to also accept girls and become a coeducational school.Westbourne was first established in Penarth in  as Westbourne House Preparatory School for Boys, and has kept the choice for children to board.A number of international students attend the school, and they often board with families from the area ndash usually Westbourne alumni themselves. More than  dferent nationalities take the opportunity to board in the area.Westbourne are rightly proud of this international aspect.ldquoEveryone here mixes in together, said Marie de Tito Mount, the schoolrsquos director of marketing. ldquoWe have children studying from Russia, China, the US, Poland, India, and theyrsquore all friends.ldquoTherersquos no cliques or groups, and wersquore proud of the international aspect this is giving our children.ldquoWe feel like wersquore making them citizens of the world.Ranked st in Wales by The Sunday Times Schools Guide and st in the UK by The DailyLeague Tables,  per cent of Westbourne graduates go to Russell Group universities or equivalently elite international institutions.The school points to two factors for this ndash the small number of pupils, and the highly trained staff.With a class size of just eight students per teacher on average, every student gets full and unided attention.The children clearly thrive from this, building confidence and passion for their work.In reception, there was a palpable excitement to show off their handmade vegetable dolls.A Year Five jumped at the chance to read out her ndash impressively well-written ndash poem.In the senior school, a young man attacked a maths problem on a board with gusto. He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too. More than  per cent of teachers at Westbourne have a PhD or masters and more than  per cent have taught internationally.Westbourne School has cultivated a warm and highly supportive culture one in which students and teachers truly support each other.For more information, visit:https:www.westbourneschool Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquom very keen to see this come further forward otherwise the Vale of Glamorgan is going to grind to a halt.Campaigners say villagers have been left in limbo by the plans because as many as nine families ndash % of the village ndash in Pendoylan could be forced to leave their homes as part of the plans.Campaigners say families are living daily with the anxiety and are unable to move on and sell their homes as the proposed new road is frightening potential buyers away.They say one elderly resident of Pendoylan, now living in a residential home, is unable to sell her house to pay for the care she needs as her property will be demolished to make way for the new roadthe councilrsquos plans proceed .And Vale Communities For Future Generations say residents inPendoylan and Peterston Super Ely could also be blighted by the air pollution and noise from HGVsthe road is built.The council says ldquono firm decision has been made to build a new road. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
