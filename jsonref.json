He’s got the speed dealers on, two men close-in catching, and two men on the boundary. Crawley punches the first for one and there’s Crawley’s fifty, an excellent innings. This is no doubt the start of something for the young man. It’s his fifth Test fifty - there will be many more. How far can he go here? He looks completely untroubled. Malan is meanwhile defending safely enough.Tom writes in: “Hi Sam, there’s an unsettling, tense badinage between Geoff Lawson and David Gower. There’s definite niggle. Regards, Tom, Drumcondra Library” Tell me more!Boland isn’t interested in the short stuff, he’s full to Malan and he’s beating him with a beautiful away swinger (to the left-hander). Some thought of a review, but declined, correctly. Malan then sort of walks at Boland’s next one - to break up his length? - and it strikes his pad, making him look a little silly. Malan was outside the line. The next ball then jumps at Malan and he rides it around the corner - it hit him on the glove and he didn’t know a lot about it. Actually that’s not fair, he hit it down. Boland is on serious song here.  Australia building some pressure but it’s not affecting Crawley. Again he pumps Cummins for four, pulling him to deep backward square for four. It raced to Boland at the boundary, he went with one hand but it burst through. Cummins is back on the money for the next couple. Just one slip now. Crawley pulls Cummins again! Wow. These are the strokes of a confident player. Four runs. This one was in front of the wicket. You don’t see Cummins taken down like this. So Boland picks up Hameed, which gives him four balls at Dawid Malan. He’s around the wicket, and Malan handles him. He’s taken 12 wickets for the series, and Adam Collins on the radio tells us that he’s drawn level with Pat Cummins on that front. Wow. Crawley flicks Cummins off his hip from the first ball confidently for four. Boland can’t get there. Later on Cummins gets one to kick and Crawley gets his hands out of the way. He responds by clipping Cummins strongly through midwicket for four. He leaves the next. Good over for Crawley, good over for England. One from Boland’s over here. He’s finding some bounce, but the defending is assured. Crawley flicks one to mid wicket to keep it ticking over. We’re seeing replays of Carey’s drop. Some suggestion it might be Warner’s? I don’t think so. The angle of Cummins’ delivery means Carey’s bodyweight is slanted the other way, but he made the ground easily enough. Two hands? Possibly came too quickly. His feet looked heavy. Cummins thinks he’s taken Crawley’s edge through to Carey, but I don’t think he’s got any friends. Cummins is keen, but no one else seems to be. He opts for everyone else’s view and rejects the review. Snicko confirms his judgment to be correct. Great ball nonetheless. Crawley’s on the front foot thereafter, and he scampers through for one behind point. Green has a shy but Hameed is home comfortably. Cummins then squares Hameed up and beats him on the outside. It angles in and nips away. Next one takes the edge and Carey spills it! He was ing away to the right, he went with one hand, he made enough ground, and if anything went too far. That hurts, big time.The SEN Radio team are talking about Australia’s ghosts from the India fixture at the SCG last year. The short ball approach, no wickets in the final session. Katich says “you have to go at the stumps”. Boland is at the stumps here, but Hameed is happy defending and leaving on the front foot. Some balls are jumping, others are dying. Some are quickening, others are slowing. But England looks assured regardless. Cummins appears to be going wide, wide, wide, then straightening. Crawley is onto it and handling it calmly. Australia’s captain finds an off stump line at the end and Crawley slightly errs in attempting to turn it to the onside, with a hint of a leading edge. Otherwise, well played. Boland gets the first three at Crawley before the opener finds a single to fine leg, then Hameed defends the final three confidently. Judging from this tweet on my timeline, Australia has a few final day demons themselves... Crawley works Cummins’ first around the corner for one, a leg bye. A conventional field for Australia. Two slips, a gully, a forward short leg. There’s a short mid wicket, all of which points to some variable bounce. Cummins is straight to Crawley again and he works him for three. His next to Hameed seams back in a fair way, but it’s comfortably left. Hameed plays and misses at the next, and Carey collects it on the bounce. That ball died a quick death. Boland kicks things off and there’s a bat-pad appeal straight away, but it’s non-committal. Hameed leaves the next and Carey takes it in front of his face. Continuing the theme, Boland gets another to jump as Hameed comes forward and it raps him on the gloves and chest. The next is much the same, but Hameed deals with it. Good signs for Boland. A maiden.To keep him in the side would be a very English move.” That settles it, he must be picked!Hi Kim Thonger! Look, most people are merely signing off with their first name and I’m taking their lead. To those whose surnames I’ve omitted against their wishes, I apologise! Please email me directly with your full names and I will publish them one by one, line by line.This is a very sensible analysis and likely scenarioSimon Katich on SEN Radio this morningGraham Thorpe made comments last night setting sights on a draw, so while the suggestion titillates, I think we’re in for a day of dogged defence. Can England do it? I actually think they can. The wicket appears to improve as the day goes on, and Australia do historically struggle to remove the opposition once set. The alternative is they lose a few early and the rest go in a hurry.He’s 35 and actualised. His rivals are ... not that. Geoff Lemon explores it all, here. For the sake of argument, I’d love to hear views - especially from the UK - on whether or not Khawaja should continue in the side. My view is that he should. While Australian teams deeply value incumbency when they’re winning, they’re also allowed to improve. Travis Head is a lock, so Marcus Harris looks precarious. So far missing from the conversation is Will Pucovski, who has his eye on the Pakistan tour. What do you think? Is there a case for retaining Harris? At 30-0, England have reason to believe they can – to use footballing parlance – “get something” from the Test. Though it came from an admittedly low base, last night Crawley and Hameed looked as assured as they have all series, and will be keen to continue on in the day’s opening exchanges. As the day wears on and wickets inevitably fall, the visitors, of course, will be relying on a number of guys carrying injury. Each of Stokes, Bairstow and Butler are walking wounded but are expected to bat. It’s a day for close-in fields, strange plans, and digging in. The weather, as ever, is dubious. The morning is meant to be OK, but it’s meant to get worse as the day goes on. Then again, they’ve said that for the last three days and rain has barely intervened.

Photograph: iStockThe  2021 Feeder School list, published today, provides new insights into the education pathways taken by thousands of students who have completed the Leaving Cert cycle. The following are five of the key take-aways from this year’s data:1. Class a determinant At a macro level more students from Deis schools (3,524) secured places on high points courses in 2021 than from fee-paying schools (3,392).The undoubted success of investment in Deis schools these figures reveal is tempered by the fact that the numbers are a proportion of Deis 10,540 school leavers, whereas the fee-paying numbers are drawn from a much smaller cohort of just 3,912 school leavers.At a micro level it would appear that fee-paying schools still dominate our most sought-after courses. Ten of the top 15 boys’ schools in terms of progression to third level are fee-paying colleges. The five non-fee-paying schools in this category, Ard Scoil Rís, Limerick Oatlands College, Mount Merrion St Benildus Stillorgan, Capuchin Rochestown Cork and Christian Brothers, Mitchelstown, mostly draw their pupils from families with similar social class backgrounds to their neighbouring fee-paying schools.Interestingly, only seven of the top 15 girls-only second-level schools are fee-paying, with three of the four most successful colleges being non-fee paying. 1st Salerno in Galway, 2nd Loreto Dalkey (fee-paying), 3rd Coláiste Muire Ennis, 4th Coláiste Íde, An Daingean.Again social-class background rather than attending a fee-paying college seems to be the determinant factor governing levels of progression.2. Most students are choosing to apply to their local or regional colleges  Irish young people, unlike their compatriots in the UK, tend to apply for third level places at their local colleges. Research carried out with those who have progressed to third level indicate that most Irish school leavers apply to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group.There is also a growing economic factor causing students to select their local institutions, driven in large part by the soaring cost of accommodations in our towns and cities: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college.There are significantly lower third level progression rates among students in counties or geographic locations, which do not have access to third level institutions and who are therefore unable to attend a chosen course without living away from home. Contrast Kilkenny 68 per cent, Longford (68) and Laois (70) with Galway (81), Donegal (84), and Clare 86 percentage progression rates to third level.3. Progression by post code Apart from the school a child attends, where families live also seems to determine overall third level progression rates. The most affluent parts of the capital city, such as Dublin 6 and Dublin 14, saw 104 and 96 per cent respectively of the total numbers of 2021 6th years who sat the Leaving Cert in schools within these postal districts progress to third level this year.In other postal districts of the city Dublin 11 and 7, the proportion of Leaving Cert students progressing to college in 2021 were 54 and 64 per cent respectively. The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into those who secured places on higher points courses. Some 96 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these programmes, compared with 46 per cent in Dublin 11.4.We still want to pursue the CAO route The current year’s numbers reveal Ireland’s exceptionally high third level participation rate, which is among the highest in the world.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retent- ion rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.5. The growth of full-time senior cycle grinds schools While pupil numbers sitting the Leaving Cert continue to increase annually due to demographic factors, our figures show that numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in 143 second-level schools (composed of nine fee-paying, 44 Deis and 90 non-fee paying institutions) dropped by more than 15 per cent this year, compared to their 2020 numbers.So what may be driving these numbers? Firstly, the country was still in recession when this year’s cohort of Leaving Cert students started second level in 2015. Specifically, in relation to the lower numbers sitting the Leaving Cert in fee-paying schools in 2021, the downturn hit family incomes in 2015, adversely affecting enrolment numbers in these schools at that time.Secondly, and probably more importantly, the presence of full-time grind schools in our major cities offering a two-year Leaving Cert programme seems to be drawing some families who can afford the fees for the final twothree years of second level education.Some parents believe that the grind schools offer a more flexible range of subject choices than those available in their child’s second-level schools. Furthermore, many students want to escape what they perceive to be restrictive rules and regulations central to our second-level school cultures."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus record 26 122 covid 19 cases reported in state","story":"Parents bringing children in the 5 to 11 age category to be vaccinated against Covid-19 at the Show Centre, Cloghran in Swords. Photograph: Alan BetsonA record 26,122 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in the State on Saturday.The Department of Health said as of 8am, 917 people were hospitalised with the virus, down 19 on the same time on Friday. There were 83 people in intensive care units.From today, all children aged 5 to 11 years will be offered a primary dose of Covid-19 vaccine.Dr Lucy Jessop, director of public health at the National Immunisation Office, said about 77,000 children are now registered for the vaccine, which equates to 16 per cent of the 480,000 in the cohort.“I wouldn’t call it vaccine hesitancy,” she told RTÉ radio’s Saturday with Katie Hannon. “I think parents have concerns obviously. They absolutely would like good information on the vaccine. They want to make sure it is safe for children.“We launched our information campaign a few weeks ago around that to give parents time to look into that information and discuss it, and if they need to discuss it with their trusted healthcare professional.“So, it is not so much vaccine hesitancy. I think parents are taking their time to consider the information and to decide whether it’s the best decision for their child to be vaccinated.”Dr Jessop said about 200 children have been hospitalised with Covid over the past two years, while about half those occurred since June. She said 12 of them required intensive care.“There are some children who unfortunately do need to go to hospital and do need intensive care and of those who were hospitalised, 70 per cent did not have an underlying condition.”In a joint statement on Friday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and chair of the National Immunisation Advisory Council Prof Karina Butler encouraged parents and s to bring their children for vaccination.Vaccination for children in this age group who have underlying health conditions or who live with someone at higher risk from Covid had already begun but the programme now opens to all in this age cohort.Meanwhile, another five patients who previously tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland. Another 3,458 positive cases of the virus were also notified on Saturday by the North’s Department of Health.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsSinn Féin’s David Cullinane’s politics were, he says, shaped by two things The first were chats with his “staunchly Fianna Fáil and republican” maternal grandparents as a teenager in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but people who also had “a lot of admiration for Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams”.The second was growing up in the working-class Ballybeg estate in Waterford, where poverty and inequality lived side by side with “a real sense of community”, he remembers. “I loved it. Even though we didn’t have a lot, we had everything, if that makes sense.“Our parents made sure that we had everything. We had good Christmases, good birthdays, we always were able to go on holidays. But I was conscious of the poverty as well... of the perceptions that people had of the housing estate I lived in.”With Sinn Féin’s rise in the polls continuing, it could well be in government after the next general election with Cullinane – the party’s heath spokesman and frequent critic of the Government on Covid-19 – installed as minister for health.Cullinane’s political career has gone from getting just under 3,000 votes in the 2002 general election to topping the poll with more than 20,000 first preferences in 2020, after which celebrations that included him exclaiming “Up the Ra” emerged.Today, the Waterford TD says: “Obviously, if we’re in government, we will have a focus on a united Ireland. We’re United Irelanders.” But that focus could upset voters who, though they say they favour the idea, display little enthusiasm for it to happen quickly.The latest Ipsos MRBI poll put SF at 35 per cent, which if replicated in an election would put it in a lead position to seek to form a coalition. However, the same poll showed that a majority are opposed to paying higher taxes or other sacrifices to bring a United Ireland about.The results suggest a disconnect between Sinn Féin’s focus on achieving a united Ireland and the priorities of voters who turned to the party in their droves at the last election over issues such as the crises in housing and health.Cullinan denies that the contradiction will cause difficulties for SF in power. A United Ireland “makes sense” and would improve public services on the island, not curb them: “I don’t see how a ision of the country as small as Ireland is to anybody’s benefit. I think partition has failed.“And I think it makes perfect sense socially, economically and politically, to have a united Ireland. People don’t see Sinn Féin preoccupied with a united Ireland. They see it as Sinn Féin wants to see a united Ireland.“But they also see Sinn Féin very active on housing, on health, on the cost of living... and they know that if we’re in government, we certainly intend to deliver on all of those. So my job if I was the future health minister is to deliver better healthcare.“If Eoin Ó Broin was the minister for housing, his job is to deliver housing for people. If Claire Kerrane was the minister for social protection, her job is to deliver fairness and deal with the cost-of-living issues.“Obviously, if we’re in government, we will have a focus on a united Ireland. We’re United Irelanders. But equally we want to improve the quality of people’s lives. And I don’t see any conflict between the two.“In fact, I don’t believe that we’ll ever have equality on the island unless we have a united Ireland.”Growing up, Cullinane watched Questions and Answers on a Monday night hoping there would be a member of Sinn Féin on the panel.Television screens at the time would also have been filled with news reports on the latest Provisional IRA atrocities, such as the Enniskillen and Warrington bombings.What did he think of these when they happened?“I would have always had a view that I understood why people were engaged in physical force but I wished it was different. I think if I was to sum it up, my thoughts at that time they were, why can’t we just sort this out? Why can’t there be a solution?“And eventually we got one with the Good Friday Agreement.”Did he ever consider joining the IRA in his youth?“No.” He said that at the time he joined Sinn Féin – 1997 – “we were working towards a peace process. It just wasn’t an option and it’s not something that I ever sought out.“I always had a view that I wanted to see a political solution.”The Belfast Agreement happened shortly after he joined Sinn Féin at a time when he was a student at Dublin Institute of Technology. He secured a certificate in business studies before leaving college for economic reasons.Cullinane got a job at a car dealership in Waterford and while he enjoyed the work, “it was just a job”.Politics was where his interests lay.When he contested the 2002 election, then-leader Gerry Adams canvassed with him.He put in a respectable showing for a first-time candidate and was elected as a councillor in 2004 and became a full-time politician.He came in for much criticism for his “Up the Ra” cry after his 2020 victory.Cullinane has said he had made a “mistake” and apologised.Comedian Patrick Kielty recently delivered a well-received speech as part of Taoiseach Micheál Martin’s Shared Island initiative where he spoke of reaching out to the loyalist community in the North.He said: “It’s way easier to sing a rebel song about a united Ireland than decide not to sing it in order to maybe have one.”Put to Cullinane that this could similarly apply to his “Up the Ra” cry, he says: “What we say is important. And I think we all need to be conscious of what we say, because we obviously have to deliver on our politics.”He praises Kielty’s speech and says it “makes perfect sense”, adding: “If we want to build a united Ireland, we’re going to have to put ourselves in the shoes of people who don’t agree with us.”He says he wants people who see themselves as British to “have all of their rights fully respected in a United Ireland”.Cullinane quotes the late Martin McGuinness and how he said: “I don’t want to see unionists treated in a united Ireland, the way nationalists were treated in a partitioned Ireland.”On health matters, what one thing would he have done differently if he were minister for health during the pandemic?“There’s so many things, but the one thing I would have done differently is preparedness, planning.”Cullinane says he sees lack of planning in areas such as the vaccine booster roll-out (which he says took too long to start), antigen tests and air filtration systems.On commentary criticising Sinn Féin’s push for a border poll he says: “The quicker I can see a united Ireland, the better, but I also realise that we have to build the foundations for a border poll.”Relationships would have to be built with “people who don’t agree with us” and there would need to be conversations “about what that Ireland would look like”. He says the Shared Island initiative is “worthwhile” but doesn’t go far enough."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"African country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside story man defected north korea went back","story":"For most people, an insanely dangerous journey across a 2.5 mile-wide border guarded by barbed-wire fences, land mines, tank traps and several thousand troops at either end would be quite enough. But on New Year’s Day, former gymnast Kim Woo Joo did it for a second time, returning to North Korea barely a year after he’d escaped the world’s most infamous hermit kingdom for a new life in the South.Such ‘boomerang defections’ are very rare: of the 30,000 people who’ve escaped North Korea and settled in the South, only around 30 are known to have gone back. But what makes 29-year-old Kim’s boomerang even rarer is that he crossed both times via the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which separates the two countries rather than take the more usual route via China.A military security camera first picked him up at about 1pm on Saturday January 1 just south of the DMZ in Gangwon province. He was warned by loudspeaker to leave the area and appeared to do so: but six hours later, under cover of darkness, he was using his gymnastic skills to climb a 10-foot barbed wire fence on the DMZ’s southern perimeter. He was spotted on three more cameras, triggered a fence alarm and was later detected on thermal observation devices deep inside the zone, but nonetheless made it through unscathed back to the North – where, unsurprisingly, he has not been heard from since.He has left behind few traces of his temporary life in the South. At his crossing point military investigators found footprints and feathers, presumably torn from his coat by the barbed wire. Reporters who went to the tiny £85 per month apartment in northern Seoul where he lived alone found it empty save for a blanket, neatly folded, left outside for collection. He worked mainly as a night cleaner in office buildings, made few friends and rarely spoke to his neighbours. He left bills for rent and medical insurance unpaid, and he used as little gas, water and electricity as possible. He stands less than five feet tall and weighs under eight stone. Were it not for the attention around his escape he would seem almost a ghost, one of the millions of subsistence-level Seoulites whose plight was part of the smash Netflix series Squid Game.There are two main questions surrounding his escape: why go back at all, and why go back via such a dangerous route? The second is perhaps easier to answer: in one word, coronavirus. Controls on North Korea’s border with China, usually reasonably active with traders and workers crossing legally, have been hugely tightened in an effort to keep the virus out of the country, with guards reportedly ordered to shoot to kill. This has drastically reduced the scope for illegal escapes: in 2020, the year Kim defected, only 229 North Koreans came to the South, less than 10 per cent of the usual number.As for the first question: some return to deliver money to family members, to help a relative in trouble, or even to try and bring others out. But many find that they simply can’t settle in the South, for their original escapes are time travel as much as simple journeys. North Korea is a country stuck several decades behind the modern world: there are few private cars, agricultural equipment is basic and manual, and only the most senior and trusted officials have access to the internet. South Korea, in contrast, is a hyperkinetic futurist maelstrom on the cutting edge of progress: Bloomberg’s 2021 Innovation Index ranks it as the second most technologically advanced country in the world after Germany. To go from one to the other, even via countries such as China and then Vietnam, Cambodia or Thailand, is to experience the most profound and disorientating culture shock imaginable.Small wonder that newly-arrived defectors are enrolled in a 12-week residential programme run by the Ministry of Unification at the Hanawon Institute. Here they’re taught everything they need to survive in a modern society: how to use an ATM and a bank account, how to apply for jobs, how representative democracy works, and so on. The ministry also helps them with accommodation, arranges medical care and provides financial assistance, and once they leave Hanawon for society at large they’re assigned a mentor to check up on them and ensure that they have what they need.But even all this can’t solve every problem. As if the dislocation of this new existence wasn’t enough, many defectors have suffered profound trauma in making the journey. They often leave family members behind, opening them up to reprisals from the authorities. They live in constant fear of being caught and sent back, sometimes for months or even years until they can reach South Korea. Female defectors are often forced into sex work.And the welcome they receive in the South is by no means uniformly positive. Some find it hard to adjust to holding a much lower status job than they did back home. Chan-yang Ju, who left North Korea in 2010, said that “in the North my  aunt was a doctor, and she and her family were very rich and important in North Korean society, but in the South she had to work in a restaurant.” She returned home in 2018. Female defectors sometimes find themselves in demand on the dating circuit – ‘northern woman with southern man,’ as a traditional saying goes – but that too is a double-edged sword.Many report discrimination and being treated as second-class citizens, even to the extent of feeling obliged to disguise their accent in order to mask their origins. This was used in Squid Game (though the subtlety was lost on Western audiences) with Kang Sae-byeok – a North Korean defector who’s one of the main characters, only using her natural accent when talking in private to her brother.Almost half of the defectors surveyed last year admitted to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, even though – or perhaps especially because – such topics are largely taboo in the North. Where North Korea’s total collectivism means that nobody can go under the radar, South Korea’s more atomised society makes it easier for people to slip through the cracks. Defector Joseph Park says that “South Korea is a society where you can live without relationships. In North Korea you need relationships to survive, and the system forces you to have relations as well.”The South Korean government, recognising – perhaps belatedly – the extent of the problem, this week announced increased support for defectors suffering psychological and economic difficulties. Nearly 25 per cent of defectors are in the lowest income bracket, six times the ratio of the general population. But all this will come too late for Kim.So what will happen to Kim Woo Joo now he’s back in the North? No-one knows for sure. At the very least he will probably be forced to attend propaganda meetings where he will tell people how terrible life in the South is.

The Kazakh government has been facing a wave of protests — precipitated by a rise in energy prices, but with their roots in years of corruption and repression. Vladimir Putin was never likely to allow a regime headed by a friendly autocrat to fall to mass protests. Whether Russian soldiers will indeed stay in the country only on a temporary basis remains to be seen.However, the crisis in Kazakhstan is unlikely to distract Mr Putin for long from another foreign policy priority: Ukraine. The threat of a Russian invasion has not disappeared, and the only response Western nations have been able to muster thus far are warnings of economic sanctions, which have not dissuaded the Kremlin in the past.European countries share some of the blame for the failure to be more robust. The EU is ided, with Germany compromised by its economic links with Russia. However, the real weakness in the Western alliance is Joe Biden. Elected to unify his country after the Trump years, he has ended up exacerbating isions. Desperate to leave Afghanistan, he was responsible for the catastrophic flight from Kabul and the resulting blow to American influence.Will Mr Biden finally be able to demonstrate the leadership and strength of character necessary to deter Mr Putin from further acts of aggression in the coming weeks? That the answer to that question is not immediately obvious illustrates the dangers facing the free world today.More from NewsBoris Johnson \u0026#39attended lockdown drinks party in No 10 garden\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge dares and dazzles on her 40th birthdayPrimary school teacher banned for life for funding Islamist terroristsVenues must protect public from terror attacks under Priti Patel proposalsBritain faces surgeon shortage, as cancelled operations leave graduates under-qualifiedLiz Truss: I’ll use Article 16 if EU won’t bend on Northern Ireland ProtocolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public wont forgive food shortages","story":"I am one of the few farmers in the House of Commons, so I have been well placed to examine the Government’s plans for the post-Brexit future of farming. The Public Accounts Committee, of which I am deputy chair, investigates the value for money provided by Government projects. Today, we are publishing our report into the Government’s flagship Environmental Land Management scheme (ELMs).At the centre of ELMs are changes to the mechanism for distributing funding, previously done via the EU’s CAP payments, to a system – due to launch fully in 2024 – where farmers will be paid for environmental and productivity improvements. The Government has stated that all the objectives of ELMs will be delivered for just over £2 billion, a target declared ambitious by the PAC members during the hearing.There are three components to the project: the Sustainable Farming Initiative (SFI) for all farmers to be paid to manage their land in an environmentally friendly way the Local Nature Recovery Strategies for more complex projects and the Landscape Recovery for large-scale projects such as peatland restoration.Due to the natural cycle of animals or plants it can take 2 years or more for the farmers executing the schemes to implement them, so timely information is vital. Much of the information concerning how these schemes will operate is coming out very late for farmers to implement.Another problem is the average age of farmers – 59. I know from my own farm that my son, who is in his 30s, is far more adept at adopting new technology and innovation is central to the success of the scheme. The third aim of ELMs is to help young people who wish to enter agriculture.As the report makes clear, without subsidies farms in England make an average net profit of just £22,800 a year. There is a real fear among small and tenant farms that many will go out of business and the average size of farms will increase. ELMs should have a part to play in protecting small and tenant farms.This scheme will require a significant amount of land taken away from agricultural use. Officials are very clear that ELMs will promote increased efficiency on the remaining land, but they were not so clear on the amount of food that will need to be imported as a result. I do not think the public will thank us if, a few years down the road, there is either a big increase in prices or, worse, a shortage of food. We need to get to a point where we produce more than 50 per cent of the food that we eat in this country. The officials and panel experts we interviewed avoided the question of whether ELMs would result in more imported food and consequently Britain effectively exporting environmental problems.All in all, many farmers are going to need to generate greater returns if they are to survive – whether from Government schemes, increased productivity or higher prices from the market.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown is deputy chairman of the Public Accounts CommitteeMore from NewsBoris Johnson \u0026#39attended lockdown drinks party in No 10 garden\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge dares and dazzles on her 40th birthdayPrimary school teacher banned for life for funding Islamist terroristsVenues must protect public from terror attacks under Priti Patel proposalsBritain faces surgeon shortage, as cancelled operations leave graduates under-qualifiedLiz Truss: I’ll use Article 16 if EU won’t bend on Northern Ireland ProtocolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mail successfully delivers letter addressed lord bishop","story":"It certainly wasn’t the most ecclesiastical or formal of titles for the spouse of a senior church figure.But when the Bishop of Worcester received a letter addressed to him and “his sexy wife” he didn’t take offence. Far from it.In fact he was so pleased he posted a photograph of the letter on social media.Well, it would be rude not to.The letter was simply addressed: “The Lord Bishop and his sexy wife, Worcester” and John Inge, Bishop of Worcester, was quick to congratulate Royal Mail for delivering it safely on such scant information.“Good old Royal Mail. This arrived safely yesterday,” he tweeted on Saturday.Dr Inge told The : “When I married my wife people said I was punching above my weight and I have to agree. We both found it very funny when the letter arrived addressed in that way.”Dr John Inge married his wife H-J Colston at St Katherine’s Church in Holt, near Bath, in January 2018.The pair were engaged in October the previous year and had known each other for 20 years.Ms Colston is a fluent Mandarin speaker who is the director of Engage With China, which works to improve knowledge of the country and its languages, and has been described as “a friend of China” by Xi Jinping, the country’s President.She also recently founded Welfare for Healthcare, an initiative to support communities during the Covid pandemic.Ms Colston was as pleased as her husband to be addressed in such complimentary terms.“She thought it was very amusing and was happy for me to tweet it,” said Dr Inge. “I’m all for Twitter being fun and not just for miserable things.”The letter to Dr Inge came from a friend who had earlier joked with him about how to address him properly in writing.The Bishop’s tweet prompted widespread amusement, with observers wondering which piece of information was the deciding factor for Worcester’s Royal Mail staff in identifying its proper recipient.“Can’t help wondering whether it was the first or the second line of the address that provided the clinching piece of information,” said Gareth Thomas, Emeritus Professor of Employment Law at University of East Anglia on Twitter.Dr Inge’s first wife Denise died of cancer in 2014 aged just 51 and left behind two children. When he became engaged to H-J he said: “to have found love again is a most wonderful thing and I feel immensely blessed.”The Bishop’s letter came after a postman in Northern Ireland managed to deliver a letter addressed only with a series of sketchy biographical details including: “Friends with the fella who runs the butchers”.Written on the envelope addressed to Feargal Lynn, a local musician and care worker, was a 57-word description of his location, including helpful hints such as “Feargal, lives across the road from the Spar” and that he “used to run discos in the parochial hall and the hotel in the 80s”.On arriving at the Royal Mail sorting office in Cushendall, County Antrim, the letter was initially set to one side until local postman Fergus McAllister had the chance to look at it and immediately recognised its intended recipient, who he happened to have been at primary school with.More from NewsBoris Johnson \u0026#39attended lockdown drinks party in No 10 garden\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge dares and dazzles on her 40th birthdayPrimary school teacher banned for life for funding Islamist terroristsVenues must protect public from terror attacks under Priti Patel proposalsBritain faces surgeon shortage, as cancelled operations leave graduates under-qualifiedLiz Truss: I’ll use Article 16 if EU won’t bend on Northern Ireland ProtocolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"science museum boards display early human migration non inclusive","story":"The Science Museum has boarded up a display on DNA and early human migration as part of work to address its “non-inclusive narrative”.Curators are to alter the “Who Am I?” gallery covering human biology, including a cabinet that deals with genetics.The display explaining mankind’s migration from Africa was earmarked for alteration in order to “update (the) non-inclusive narrative”, internal documents show, and the exhibit has been boarded up.The display titled “How Did You Get Here?” stressed humanity’s common lineage, with a panel stating that the “human journey began in Africa” and “all humans alive today descend from African ancestors”.Maps in the display also showed how mankind ultimately spread to the Americas and Polynesia, and displayed figurines, model boats, a bow, and drum to illustrate the far-flung areas of Homo Sapien colonisationThe cabinet on prehistoric “pioneers who open up new worlds” has been covered with white hoardings that state staff are “updating the contents of this case” and asking visitors to “bear with us and enjoy the rest of the gallery”.A nearby plinth titled “Out of Africa” - the name of the theory of human migration from the continent - is now bare, but a display on “the first European” remains in place.The Science Museum has not given a schedule for the changes to the display, and has not clarified which specific objects in the cabinet resulted in the display being assessed as “non-inclusive”.It is understood the display contained a hula girl figurine - an object that has recently been criticised for presenting a stereotypical view of Polynesian people - and genetic studies relating to the San people in South Africa, who in 2017 devised a code of ethics for scientists studying them.A spokesman for the museum said: “The How did I get here? display in the Who Am I? gallery is currently covered while curators review content that is more than a decade old relating to migration, race and genetics which no longer reflects current scientific thinking.“We are planning to update the Who Am I? gallery on a rolling basis, where resource allows, to reflect areas where there has been fresh research or a shift in scientific understanding.”The changes follow the earmarking of the Who Am I? gallery for updates, with The  previously revealing that a cabinet on gender differences titled “Boy Or Girl?” was also up for review following “complaints about a lack of mention of transgender”.The proposals were criticised by Maya Forstater, executive director of campaign group Sex Matters and winner of a prominent employment tribunal relating to her “gender-critical” views, who said: “It is concerning that a place dedicated to science is being swayed by cultural trends in this way.”Sir Gregory Winter, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist, said that influence from cultural trends was in some ways inevitable for scientific organisationsHe told The : “Science is driven mainly by scientists seeking an understanding of ourselves, our world, and our past, our present and our future. It is also driven by scientists seeking to use this information for practical and - often commercial - purposes.“Inevitably scientists have had to engage with the public and with the zeitgeist.“For example, science has been shaped by the zeitgeist, as in the regulations relating to embryo research and the genetic engineering of organisms. Scientists have also shaped the zeitgeist - spectacularly with climate change.“As for museum curators, they also have to engage with the public and the zeitgeist. It is entirely possible to explain the same science in different ways to the public, and it is not unreasonable for curators to review their efforts in the light of new research or other considerations.“As far as I am concerned, the key test for a museum exhibit is whether it represents the underlying scientific consensus in a clear and engaging manner to a wide constituency.“I would have liked to use the word ‘truth’ rather than ‘consensus’ - but sometimes, as in evolutionary studies with sparse data, it may be impossible to establish a ‘truth’.“Of course, organisations should not ‘pander too much’, but they should engage.”More from NewsBoris Johnson \u0026#39attended lockdown drinks party in No 10 garden\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge dares and dazzles on her 40th birthdayPrimary school teacher banned for life for funding Islamist terroristsVenues must protect public from terror attacks under Priti Patel proposalsBritain faces surgeon shortage, as cancelled operations leave graduates under-qualifiedLiz Truss: I’ll use Article 16 if EU won’t bend on Northern Ireland ProtocolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"swabbing throat nose boosts covid detection lateral flow tests","story":"Using lateral flow tests to swab the throat and nose is more accurate than simply relying on nasal samples, senior health officials believe, as ministers consider updating advice for tens of millions of test users.The  understands ministers are examining data which shows that swabbing someone\u0027s throat as well as their nose - even with a kit designed just for the nose - is more likely to detect Covid-19 and can pick up evidence of the virus as much as a day earlier than simply relying on nose samples.The data could lead to people being encouraged to swab their throats in order to increase the chance of their test kit identifying evidence of the virus.It comes as the number of Covid patients in hospital beds in England dropped for the first time since Christmas Day on Saturday, raising hope that the omicron wave could be waning.Official figures showed 129 fewer hospital beds were occupied by people with Covid compared to Friday, down to 16,034 from 16,163, arresting an uninterrupted rise over the past fortnight. The figure, however, is still the highest recorded since mid-February last year, when cases had dropped off by around half since the January peakHospital numbers also continued to look positive in London, where the number of patients admitted for Covid dropped for the third consecutive day, while the seven-day average dropped for the fifth consecutive day.Last week, Meaghan Kall, the UK Health Security Agency\u0027s lead epidemiologist on Covid-19, tweeted: Top tip: you can use your \u0027nasal only\u0027 swab to swab your throat, if you want to up your chance of detection.A small study has shown 4 of 5 people had more virus in throat than nose in the early phase (first 3 days) of omicron infection.However, the tweet was later removed amid concern in Government that the advice, which conflicts with instruction manuals accompanying many kits, could cause confusion.Another government scientific adviser said: I know UKHSA had good data showing that nasal swabs were genuinely reliable and a good predictor and the throat swabs didn\u0027t add very much. But that was some time ago.It comes as Sajid Javid is understood to have ordered an additional 100 million lateral flow tests for use this month, taking the total available kits in January to 400 million.Last month the Health Secretary tripled the monthly supply of lateral flow tests from 100m to 300m.A Government source said: We want to do everything we can to keep people safe. Tests are incredibly important alongside vaccines and antivirals as one of our key lines of defence.The potential change to official advice comes amid increasing reports of lateral flows giving unreliable results.One woman who spoke to The  said that when using the Flowflex test, the principle device being circulated by the Government, the tests had only registered as positive three days into her symptoms when using the swab on her nose only. While others complained of false positives.One Twitter user called Jon said: “I’ve had 2 positive test results with Flowflex kits in recent months and each PCR done within 2 hours has always been negative.Today a Flowflex kit has done the same (positive), so I did an older tonsil+nostril test as well which was negative. So which is right.Lucy Trimnell, a councillor at South Somerset District Council, said: Bizarrely my PCR positive friend only tested positive on the Flowflex tests, the other throatnose ones were consistently negative.Professor Sheila Bird, of the Cambridge University Biostatistics Unit, said there was an urgent need for real-world data on the effectiveness of current lateral flow devices against omicron.It is important that we understand the performance of lateral flow tests in the omicron era, she said.You cannot necessarily assume that when you change the context - i.e. we move from one variant to another - the same sensitivity applies.On Friday, a study emerged suggesting test kits using nasal swabs are slower to pick up omicron infections than kits using throat swabs.The US research indicated that it takes an average of three days for people to test positive on the nasal-based devices following their first positive PCR result.It comes as cases continue to remain high across the UK, with a further 146,390 recorded in the UK as of 9am on Saturday.Saturday also marked another grim milestone as the Government’s daily figures showed the number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test had passed 150,000.More from NewsBoris Johnson \u0026#39attended lockdown drinks party in No 10 garden\u0026#39Duchess of Cambridge dares and dazzles on her 40th birthdayPrimary school teacher banned for life for funding Islamist terroristsVenues must protect public from terror attacks under Priti Patel proposalsBritain faces surgeon shortage, as cancelled operations leave graduates under-qualifiedLiz Truss: I’ll use Article 16 if EU won’t bend on Northern Ireland ProtocolMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"four ways make your christmas","story":"Four ways to make your Christmas with loved ones safer according to GPWe can still have a great time together – just follow these tips to help protect loved ones from the new Covid- strainthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-numbers-uk-records--,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:ceaefcdbe,sourceUrl:Copied from RSC,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:dtzrPE,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It’s not perfect, especially after last year, but I’d rather everyone stays safe.”  As Dr Ashley points out, rapid lateral flow tests are designed to pick up Covid- cases with no symptoms, soyou do have symptoms such as a fever, cough or loss of sense of taste or smell, you need to isolate immediately and take a PCR test. Andyour rapid lateral flow test does show a positive result, you’ll need to isolate and only leave the house to take a PCR test to confirm it.If you have been in contact with someone with Covid- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. If you test positive or develop symptoms in those seven days, you must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the guidance on gov.uk.If you are unvaccinated, you must self-isolate for  daysyou are in contact with someone who has Covid-.Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who’s tested positive, so keep it on.Open the window sLetting fresh air into your home is one way to help reduce the spread of Covid-. Opening windows and doors for just  minutes will help. “Covid- is an airborne virus and the research suggests that when you’re in a well-ventilated space the risk of contracting it is reduced,” says Dr Ashley. “That’s why being outdoors is much more safe, but that’s tricky when it’s very cold. Soyou want to reduce the chances of Covid- being passed on, have the windows open so you get as much airflow as possible.” Wear a face covering You must wear a face covering in public areas such as shops, places of worship, entertainment venues, and on public transport. It’s wise to wear a mask in crowded or enclosed spaces, eventhey’re not legally required. “Face coverings are really effective at reducing how much you’re spreading Covid-,” explains Dr Ashley. Get your booster Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Book yours now at nhs.uk covidvaccination.Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent than ever before with Covid- because Omicron is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a Covid- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.If you haven’t had your first or second vaccine, go to nhs.uk covidvaccination or call  to book it, or find your nearest walk-in centre.“It’s also very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” adds Dr Ashley. “The benefits of being vaccinated and boosted really outweigh the risks.”People with lower immune systems might need to be more careful about socialising this Christmas, as they could have less protection against getting severely ill with Covid-. This includes people who are taking medication that suppresses the immune system – eg, for rheumatoid arthritis – and those having chemotherapy.

Boris Johnson is sticking to Plan B measures which means people are being expected to take a testthey have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive for the virus.The quickest and easiest way to checkyou have the virus is to take a lateral flow test.Dr Nathan, an AE doctor in London at @expedition_doctor, said the three biggest mistakes are failing to spot positives, not reading the instructions, and mixing up the best way to conduct the test.He warned: “Any positive line within  minutes, evenit is so faint that it is barely visible, equals a positive result. “However,a faint line appears after  minutes, this can be ignored.” Hereaposs important things you need to know about lateral flow test and what you should doyou give a positive result.  Where can you get a lateral flow test  The best place to start is to find outyou are able to get lateral flow tests through your workplace, school or university.However, this option wonapost be available to everyone, in which case they can be ordered from the NHS website.Usually these lateral flow tests will be delivered to your home in a matter of days but there is currently shortage due to demand.  How much do the tests costs  Luckily, the tests are generally free for all purposes apart from travel. You can also go and collect them in person at pharmacies like Boots or Lloyds, as well as some community centres. Getting tests in this way is also usually free. A pack has seven tests, one for each day of the week. And, in some cases, you will be able to get two packs at once.  Is taking a test safe  According to health chiefs and medical experts, misinformation about lateral flow tests is re. Despite the risk of slight discomfort in your nasal passage, there is no risk to your brain when conducting a test.Along the same lines, misinformation spread on Facebook after a live video broadcast ly suggested ethylene oxide-coated swabs in lateral flow tests cause cancer.The Department for Health and Social care has addressed claims that Covid- tests pose a danger to humans. It told Reuters: Lateral flow tests have been rigorously tested and are safe to use on a regular basis. Any suggestion otherwise is inaccurate and harmful misinformation. Ethylene oxide is only used in the sterilisation of swabs and it is one of the most commonly used sterilisation tools in the healthcare industry, principally applied by manufacturers to keep medical devices safe. How to do a lateral flow test Before you take the test, you should blow your nose and wash your hands thoroughly. You need to put the swab about .cm into your nostril, and roll it around slowly for around  seconds. It will be easieryou continue to breathe through your nose while youaposre doing this. Some lateral flow tests are for your throat - in this case you need to swab your tonsils on both sides for around  seconds. Be careful not to touch the fabric of the swab once you have taken it out your nose or mouth. The test comes with liquid in a packet - you need to squeeze this into the small vial provided. You then need to put the swab into the vial - fabric end first - and press it firmly into the liquid while rotating it around  times. You can then dispose of the swab. You will have a nozzle cap for the vial - put this on tightly, and then carefully squeeze out two drops onto the specimen strip. Put this on a flat surface.  How long do you wait for a result You should wait for  minutes. Your results will appear - two linesit is positive, one line on the topitaposs negative, or one line on the bottomthe test is invalid.The lines may be faint - butthere are two, it means that you likely have coronavirus.What do you do with the test after Whether your Covid test is positive or negative, they should all be placed in the general waste bin. First place all the used items in the plastic pouch provided in the kit. The government website explains thatyou’re doing a home rapid lateral flow test, you should dispose of the used rapid lateral flow kit in your waste bin at home or at work. Used test kit items could include the:swab test strip sachet extraction tubeAccording to health chiefs and medical experts, misinformation about lateral flow tests is re. Despite the risk of slight discomfort in your nasal passage, there is no risk to your brain when conducting a test.  What to doyou test positive If you test positive for coronavirus you will need to self isolate immediately. This means you will need to stay at home for the duration of the self-isolation period. If you have one of the following three symptoms you will self isolate and take a PCR test. The result of this test will determine whether or not you need to continue isolating or are free to go out again as usual. The three NHS-defined symptoms are:a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteYou will also need to self isolateyou are contacted by Test and Trace, unless you are exempt, which includes people who have been vaccinated. If you need to self isolate and do not you could be handed a fine. If you test positive anyone who lives with you will have to self isolate also. However, there are major exemptions to this rule including vaccinated people. People aged over  years and six months who are not fully vaccinated will need to self isolate.

Mr McDonnell says the combined impact of the hikes, coupled with council tax rises and extra housing costs, will leave the average household at least £, worse off.The former shadow chancellor called for £ winter fuel payments to be doubled and the £ cut in Universal Credit to be reinstated as part of a £.billion package of measures which would be paid for by scrapping corporate tax relief this year. He said: ”Half measures simply will not work when people are faced with the mounting scale of this cost of living crisis. The Government cannot stand by and watch families go under. “A comprehensive rescue package is needed to provide people with the security they need to avoid the worries and hardship many are now facing.” The plea comes as millions of pensioners struggle to heat their homes with fuel support benefits that have not increased in more than  years.Cold weather payments paid out when temperatures fall below freezing for seven days have remained at £ a week since March . And warm home discounts, a one off reduction on bills for those getting pension credit, have stayed at £ since they were introduced in .Age UK’s Caroline Abrahams warned “catastrophic” hikes in energy bills could push another , older households into fuel poverty - spending more than  per cent of their income on trying to stay warm. She said: “Support for older people over the colder months has remained broadly unchanged for years and is nowhere near enough to match the scale of the current problem. Without urgent action, the consequences of such huge energy price hikes will be nothing short of catastrophic.” She said inflation, which last month jumped to . per cent, is already eating into people’s pensions. She added: “Many older people are already putting their health at risk by rationing their food and heating to keep their bills down.” As part of Age UK’s The Cost of Cold campaign, the charity is calling for a one off £ winter fuel payment and wants the new £million Household Support Fund, distributed by local councils, to be doubled.

In an apparent climbdown, the Housing Secretary is expected to announce that leaseholders in buildings between  and  metres tall will no longer have to take out loans to cover the costs.Instead, a Treasury letter reported by BBC Newsnight suggests he will threaten tax or legislation to pressure developers to cover the costs facing leaseholders, with no more money coming from the Government.Only leaseholders in buildings taller than  metres can currently access grants to replace unsafe cladding under measures introduced in England after the Grenfell Tower fire killed  people in . The letter from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke to Mr Gove said loans for smaller buildings would be replaced by a limited grant scheme. You may use a high-level aposthreatapos of tax or legal solutions in discussions with developers as a means to obtaining voluntary contributions from them, it read. I am pleased to see that you acknowledge the principle that the taxpayer should not be on the hook for further costs of remediation. To reiterate, my approval of this new package for -m buildings is therefore conditional on no further Exchequer funding.  Senior Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, who co-chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Leasehold and Commonhold Reform, urged the Government to go further. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: From what weaposre hearing, progress is being made - itaposs not enough. Sir Peter said we need to get the money, spend it properly, and we need to overcome the hurdle of indemnity funding so landlords can make claims from developers and manufacturers. He said the Government must tell insurance companies to come to the table with, say, £ billion and then innocent leaseholders will live in homes which are safe and saleable. Labouraposs shadow housing minister Matthew Pennycook said: Any new measures that help resolve the building safety crisis are welcome, but on the face of it these appear far less signicant than they sound. Nothing on non-cladding defects, no new developer levy and the position on leaseholder liability unchanged. We await further detail. A spokesman for the End Our Cladding Scandal campaign said the devil is in the detail, with the letter saying the measures do not extend to non-cladding costs. Itaposs a welcome step in the right direction but thereaposs still a long road to travel, he said. Itaposs not definite stillwe are getting to the destination we want to get to but we are cautiously optimistic. The BBC and the Dailyreported that an announcement on the measures is expected on Monday. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: Innocent leaseholders are still facing eye-watering bills to fix non-cladding fire safety defects, not of their making, and more defects may be discovered once cladding starts to come off. Anything short of putting new laws in place to make the developers pay for their shoddy and dangerous house-building is a betrayal of innocent leaseholders whose lives have been put on hold for four years already. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman did not dispute the contents of the leaked letter, but added: We will not comment on speculation.

One MP said: “There is a lot of manoeuvring going on to keep Liz off the final ticket. “Many of our members are dotty enough to vote for her and we would end up with a worse leader than we have now.” Ms Truss has used exclusive London club , Hertford Street to host “fizz with Liz” dinners with MPs and “biz for Liz” receptions with possible campaign donors. The club is owned by environment minister Lord Zac Goldsmith’s millionaire half-brother Robin Birley, who gave £, to Mr Johnson’s  leadership campaign.It was where Prince Harry had his first date with future we Meghan Markle. Angry Tory MPs have been plotting the PM’s downfall after blunders such as his failed attempt to water down Commons sleaze rules, Covid breaking No parties and his waffly speech about Peppa Pig.But the Sunday Mirror understands Mr Sunak and Mr Hunt have not discussed the contest to keep their hands clean leaving the dirty work to their supporters. The deal being thrashed out would keep Mr Sunak as Chancellor in a Hunt government and give Mr Hunt the pick of top jobs in a Sunak one. And Tory MPs would be more likely to vote for themthey were not taking lumps out of each other during the campaign. Chair of the Tory backbench  committee Sir Graham Brady needs  letters from Tory MPs calling for a no confidence vote in the PM to bring Mr Johnson down. Andmore than half the Parliamentary party vote in favour then Boris Johnson would be a goner and a leadership election begins. Sir Graham never reveals how many signatures he has - not even to the PM - until they reach the magic number. But Tory insiders estimate around a dozen letters have now been sent. A source said: “People are holding back because the timing has got to be just right. “If Boris survives a vote of no confidence then under party rules he cannot be challenged again for another year.” Another MP said: “We’re gearing up for a tough fight. Boris will only leave No kicking and screaming.”Predecessor Theresa May won a confidence vote by  Conservative MPs to  in December  as she struggled with Brexit.But she was forced to resign the following year after failing to get support for her EU withdrawal agreement.Other leadership challengers waiting in the wings include Health Secretary Sajid Javid, , Levelling Up supremo Michael Gove, , and Foreign Affairs Committee chair Tom Tugendhat, .Disgraced former Health Secretary Matt Hancock, , may even throw his hat in the ring and last week appointed a new communications chief to schmooze the media. But former Cabinet minister Dr Liam Fox said: “This is a time for unity over ision, hard work over personal ambition, and putting the country before party. “It is not a time for a leadership challenge.” Mr Sunak, Mr Hunt and Ms Truss did not comment.

Ashfield MP Lee Anderson was recently criticised for telling a female district councillor in his constituency to “stay out of big boy’s politics”. The Tories appointed him to the committee in May last year, despite having reprimanded him over sexist behaviour. But after just six months on the committee, he was quietly replaced in mid-December by former equalities minister Caroline Dineage. Mr Anderson has not publicly addressed his stepping back from the committee, and did not respond to a request for comment. Commons records show he left the Committee on December . Mr Anderson made headlines during the Euro  tournament for announcing he would not watch England matches because he did not like “the taking the knee business.” Mr Anderson was “warned” by Conservative party in  over a Facebook post while he was a Councillor.Alongside a picture of a woman wearing a low-cut tank top, Mr Anderson wrote: “Out with some great knockers tonight in Skegby.” In November, he sparked fury in his local constituency by telling Ashfield District Councillor Samantha Deakin to “stay out of big boy’s politics.” Cllr Deakin had criticised Mr Anderson in a row about a local college. “Like many people, Lee Anderson’s appointment to the Women’s and Equality Select Committee was a surprise to me,” she said. “ More than that - it was an insult. Since then, I have been a victim of his misogyny.” She added: “We asked the Conservative Party last year whether his current membership of this important committee was appropriate – they didn’t reply. “It’s clear however that someone has agreed and this Select Committee can now get on with their job without the influence of someone with the views of a s Working Men’s Club comedian.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Lee AndersonConservative PartyThe EuroPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So we should be grateful to the extra effort Prince Andrew has put in to make them seem not just ordinary, but like the family on the housing estate everybody signs a petition to get evicted. If they’d been on the Jeremy Kyle show, their title along the bottom would have gone on for  minutes, starting: “One son involved with gang that was put in jail… another son married teenager while having affair with woman he eventually married after first one crashed in car… grandkids cut off after fleeing to Canada and calling family racist on TV…” If they did live in a normal street, all the neighbours would whisper to each other: “They were at it again last night, keeping us awake by shooting partridges until two in the morning.” Now Andrew’s case for ending civil proceedings in which he’s accused of sex offences is that the accuser once received money in a “non-disclosure deal”, to keep quiet about similar goings-on from the man thought to have been arranging them. This seems an unusual line to take, to say: “I didn’t do it. And it’s not fair because she promised she wouldn’t mention it.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  But I’m sure Andrew knows what he’s doing. I might try something similar next time I get a fine for driving in a bus lane. It’s probably all part of his selfless campaign to modernise his family, by making them seem like they’re from a typical troubled background. I expect the next story will be that Andrew has been training the corgis for dog-fighting in the grounds of Balmoral. He’ll invite his mates over and they’ll stand in the woods betting, and shouting: “GO on Digger, use your teeth son.” Then he’ll be exposed selling iPads that he robbed from PC World, after he was caught because CCTV showed him using a Range Rover as his getaway car. And the security guard identied him because Andrew demanded he stood up and saluted him even though he was tied to a chair. But his defence team will argue the case should be thrown out because the store once signed a non-disclosure deal with Crazy Ernie, who’s doing  years for blowing up the Bank of England with gunpowder. But he’ll clear it all up in an interview on Newsnight, in which he explains he only went round the pubs of Windsor selling the iPads, because he needed to explain to the bar staff that he wasn’t going to buy their crisps any more. The Queen has reportedly been paying his legal fees, but she needs to go further to complete the image. She has to arrive at the court screaming: “He’s f***ing innocent you ****”, while William yells “What you f***ing looking at  Do you want some, do you ” to the judge, for asking him to put out his cigarette and turn off his motorbike in the courtroom. They’re worth every penny.

The -year-old boy was stabbed in February last year after he was lured out by Snapchat message he thought were from a girl wanting to meet up, Bristol Live reports. But when he arrived at the meeting point in Fishponds, Bristol, he was kned nine times and left for dead by two  year olds in what is described as a revenge attack.The two teenagers, who have since turned  and cannot be named because of their age, were sentenced to youth custody in Bristol Crown Court on Friday.A -year-old male, who stabbed the victim, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm ahead of a trial in November, while a female was found guilty of the same offence by jurors, BristolLive reported.During her trial, the jury were told the victim was part of a rival group within Bristol and was deliberately lured to the Ridgeway Road area that night so he could be attacked. The male received a four-year sentence and the female three years.  Judge Michael Longman described the attack as co-ordinated and done with the intention of causing very serious injuries. Detective Inspector Roger Doxsey said: “This was a vicious and calculated attack on a then -year-old boy. He was mercilessly chased and stabbed approximately nine times and left for dead. “Described in court as a ‘Snapchat honey trap’, the female lured the victim to a park in Fishponds on the understanding that they were having a date, whereupon he was set upon by a number of males with knives.  “After the attack the male offender sent a ‘mic drop emoji’ with his face on via Snapchat to the female offender. His emoji meant ‘job done’ and shows the true intent behind the crime. “The victim was in intensive care but has thankfully made a steady recovery from his multiple injuries. He bravely gave evidence and we are grateful for his and his family’s support.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footageCourt caseCrown courtCrimeTeenagersKne crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The University of Warwickaposs Dr Mike Tildesley believes the world will soon learn toagain as normal. The medic, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Modelling group which feeds into SAGE, previously questioned the need for curbs.He raised hopes that cases are starting to slow in Covid hot-spot London despite the UK reporting nearly , new cases on Friday.Dr Tildesley pointed to the capitalaposs flatlining cases and hospital admissions as an encouraging sign that things are starting to turn around.  He told Times Radio: The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new iant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. Itaposs very similar to the common cold that weaposve lived with for many years. Weaposre not quite there yet but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term - it is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe. Hopefully, as we move more towards the spring and we see the back of Omicron, we can get more inter-relationship of living with Covid as an endemic disease and protecting the vulnerable.  But he did state that the North East and North West of England are seeing the most concerning rates of the Omicron iant. However, he added: It doesnapost sound all doom and gloom, what we are seeing from hospital admissions is that stays in hospital do appear to be on average shorter, which is good news, symptoms appear to be a little bit milder, so this what we are seeing consistently with the Omicron iant. His comments come after the Prime Minister told a Downing Street press conference this week that England had a chance to ride out this Omicron wave without shutting down our country.  On Friday, the UK reported , daily coronavirus cases and another  deaths. The government say there are , people in hospital with coronavirus as of the last count. Of those,  of whom are in ventilation beds. The R rate has increased and is now estimated to be between . and ., according to the latest figures.

We know now that Omicron is less severe… and we certainly know that once you get boosted that your chance of hospitalisation, our latest analysis shows, is almost % less than it was with Delta.

The digital togs can be used to dress cartoon versions of participants in virtual worlds. A £, golf outfit is just one of the items available online, and a matching Tam O’Shanter hat will set you back another £,. For £,, you can also get a tracksuit covered in the Decentraland Games logo, which can be worn in Decentraland – one of the most developed virtual worlds on the internet. Designer brands are also getting in on the mindboggling new trend, with Dolce  Gabbana, Nike and Adidas all producing clobber for the virtual world. Each piece of clothing is sold as an NFT – or non-fungible token – which can be bought and sold in real-le like a painting or any other valuable item. scoops@sundaymirror Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  An industry source said: “Fashion in the real world might seem mad at times with some of the outfits that go for silly money, but this is a whole new realm. “We are talking about people paying thousands for something that only exists as pixels on a screen. It is unbelievable.” So far, DG has auctioned off nine digital designer pieces for an eye-watering total of £.million. The lots included The Glass Suit – a green and silver outfit which sold for £,, alongside a real-le version of the suit. In March, the first virtual fashion week will be held – in the real world. And virtual sportswear is set to be big business too.  Nike has bought tech company RTFKT, recently valued at £million, to help them create and sell virtual trainers. And Adidas has teamed up with two companies to take their Originals range into cyberspace. Tech consultant Grace Rachmany said: “Selling clothing in games is here to stay but I think the prices are out of proportion right now.  “A lot of people have money in cryptocurrencies that they won’t take out because they’ll have to pay tax so to them, it’s like play money.”The surge of interest in NFTs comes after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced the future of his company lay in the “metaverse” – a virtual D world.There, users can play games, shop, interact with friends and even hold business meetings wearing virtual reality goggles,they wish.  Decentraland, which has its own cryptocurrency, recently made headlines when a plot of “real estate” sold for £.million. But real-le criminals are cashing in too. Todd Kramer, of New York’s Ross + Kramer Gallery, spent £.million on NFT cartoon apes from Bored Ape Yacht Club, only for them to be stolen by a hacker.A-Z on digital NFTsNon-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are one of the world’s biggest internet crazes. While some experts say they are the future of the art and fashion world, others believe investors will suffer a similar fate to those who splashed out during the dot-com boom  years ago – only to lose heavily. An NFT is a unique unit of computer data stored in a special piece of code called a blockchain. It can be associated with a digital asset such as a video, picture, quote or even an outfit. The fact they have a unique signature means they are finite and can be bought and sold like real-world artwork or collectibles. A blockchain allows cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to exist as it records on a digital ledger proof that a token changed hands. While for cryptocurrencies each token has the same value like a £ coin, NFTs all have dferent values depending on how much people are willing to spend on them – like paintings or antiques. The first known NFT was a digital graphic called Quantum designed in  by artist Kevin McCoy and we Jenner. He sold the artwork to entrepreneur Anil Dash during a presentation for just £. but it is now thought to be worth more than £million. The niche technology only became mainstream in  with a string of highprofile sales. Artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold his work Everydays: the First  Days for .million in a sale that shook the art world. Since then major artists such as David Hockney and Jeff Koons, and singer Grimes, have sold NFTs for vast sums.

Nathan’s parents want to add his name to the national Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire.But the Ministry of Defence refuses – claiming his suicide and PTSD were not linked to his service. Lord Dannatt has now told the Sunday People he was “saddened” by the family’s treatment and pledged to raise the issue in the House of Lords.He said: “The first issue is to get the MoD to issue a clear policy and second to consider Nathan Hunt’s case fairly – and hopefully, favourably.”Royal Engineers warrant officer Nathan served alongside Prince Harry in Afghanistan in . Nathan received a Mention in Despatches for finding dozens of Taliban bombs and helped save many lives. His  years’ Army service included tours of Iraq, Bosnia and Northern Ireland. He was found hanged at his Lincoln home aged  on January , . That year Lord Dannatt introduced Nathan’s parents to Prince Harry and Meghan.  Last month Derek, , and Maria, , wrote to Harry asking for his support. As we reported, the prince wrote a moving reply saying he would always remember Nathan as a hero but was unable to help after losing his Army titles.  Derek said: “I’m delighted General Dannatt has agreed to help us. It seems he also feels that the MoD’s decision is unfair.” An ex-soldier himself, Derek claimed documents used by defence chiefs in the case contained errors. He said: “The MoD are more interested in protecting their reputation than trying to find out why Nathan took his own le. I also think they are trying to trash his reputation by saying that Nathan suffered from alcohol abuse and that he was aggressive. “Those comments refer to his first marriage which ended in .

Clford Westfall and Clair Patterson live in Bradford, Yorkshire, with their nine children, as well as Clair’s brother and Clford’s brother, both of whom need extra support. But the family is now living in fear that they could be torn apart, after Bradford Council told them they must leave their home of two-and-a-half years by January . They even fear they could be forced to move into a hostel,they are unable to find another property by the deadline. Clford, , told Yorkshire Live that all they wanted was to be together as a family. The couple pay £, a month for the privately-rented property in Green Head Road and are desperate to remain in the area.Do you think the council should help this family  Share your view in the comments section below Their seven youngest children all go to school in Keighley and the family business, a toy shop in the town centre, is just a mile away. Clair said: If we lived where, it would be physically impossible for me to get seven kids to four dferent schools and then get to work. It just wouldnapost happen.” However, an extension to the property, built by the landlord, breaches planning regulations. The works exceeded the agreed dimensions and the house is now deemed too tall. Three separate retrospective planning applications and an appeal to the governmentaposs planning inspector have all failed. It led to the council obtaining a compulsory purchase order on the property. Clford, Clair and their family were initially told to move out by January . After Clford and Clair were told to leave, they said they asked for help from the council to find somewhere  to live after struggling to find anywhere suitable. There is nothing on the market for a family of our size, said Clford. We used to live in a three-bedroom house a few years ago. We were so happy, even though it was so small, but it just wasn’t big enough.  Since we have been in this big house, we have never been secure or comfortable. The council say they can’t put us in a four or five-bedroom house, because it would be overcrowded, but we need to be together. The couple say they have even asked whether they could have two homes knocked through into one. We’re not trying to be money-grabbers, said Clford. We’re completely willing to pay our way. We pay £, a month in rent. We pay £ a month council tax, we pay all the bills on our house. We don’t want a big house and for it to be cheap. We will pay. We just want to be together. Shortly after YorkshireLive approached Bradford Council for a comment, the local authority said it was trying to extend the deadline beyond January , but this is yet to be formally approved. A spokesperson added the council will continue to support the family throughout the process and that it is exploring the possibility of providing two accommodation units adjacent or in close proximity to each other. But Clford and Clair claim they have been told their family could be moved into a hostel. When they said that, I thought: ‘Is that for real ’ said Clford. “What’s one foot or two feet compared to making a family homeless  If we had to [leave Keighley] we’d do it. But a hostel  It just can’t happen. It wouldn’t work. The couple have one child together, but have custody for their eight children from previous relationships. The youngest is just two-years-old, while the oldest is . Local councillor Mohsin Hussain has tried to push the council to provide more help for the family. It is very dficult to find another property of this size, but I have said to the council that we need to find another property for Clford and his family to move into - or to extend the deadline,” he said. The council is not in the wrong on this, but there needs to be support from the council and from the housing associations for Clford and his family.” However, the family, who spent Christmas with the deadline looming large over their heads, are still no closer to finding somewhere  to live. The couple claim they pay their rent to Jigsaw Property Services. However, a spokesperson for the letting agent said they didn’t let the property out anymore. In a statement, a spokesperson for Bradford Council said: The breach that Mr Westfall appears to be referring to relates to planning permission rather than building regulations. This was obtained by the owner of the property in  to extend the house however, the actual works carried out went beyond that approved resulting in an unauthorised increase in the overall height of the property. Three separate retrospective planning applications for an increase in the roof height have been submitted since the works were undertaken. These applications were all refused and an appeal to the governmentaposs planning inspector by the owner challenging the decision was dismissed on May , . In view of this and as the owner failed to recty the breach, an enforcement notice was issued requiring them to carry out the work in accordance with the approved planning permission or demolish the unauthorised works. No appeal was submitted against the enforcement notice and therefore it should have been complied with by August , . With regard to rehousing Mr Westfall and his family, Mr Westfall and his family have been assessed by the Local Authority’s Housing Options Service in accordance with the Homelessness Reduction Act . The Housing Options Officer is currently exploring suitable rehousing options in the private and social housing sectors. This also includes providing two accommodation units adjacent or in close proximity to each other. Should Mr Westfall become homeless before the eviction deadline, the Local Authority will have a statutory duty to offer temporary accommodation with one of our commissioned providers. The temporary accommodation offer,needed, will be in the same location. The Local Authority will continue to support Mr Westfall and his family during this rehousing process. The council is currently in the process of preparing legal documentation to extend the current deadline of January ,  to allow additional time to source suitable housing options for Mr Westfall and his family. He will be in receipt of this documentation within the next seven days.

We have to wear our coats and dressing gowns because itaposs that cold in here. Weaposve got storage heaters, but theyaposre not that hot so itaposs freezing in here.  When I do have them on itaposs taking a lot of electric, like Iaposve put £ on two days ago and Iaposve got £. Itaposs still freezing because of the damp. Itaposs costing a lot...weaposre constantly topping up on electric. Birmingham City Council is due to demolish the building in the near future and some flats have already been vacated in preparation.  Emma says sheaposs emailed and called the council but has so far not been moved. My son has got airways disease and since weaposve been here Iaposm constantly at the doctoraposs because his chest is getting worse and heaposs had to go on steroids, she continued. I suffer with depression as it is and Iaposm worried about my childrenaposs health over it.  I have a bone condition and some days, I canapost walk properly. I have pains in my legs and arms, and the damp is making it worse. Iaposm getting into bed of a night and Iaposm in agony. Birmingham City Council has apologised for the issues and vowed to treat the mould.In a statement, it said: We are sorry for the problems this tenant has experienced with mould in their flat. The block is due to be demolished in the next couple of years. In the meantime, we have organised for a contractor to treat the mould and will work with the tenant to rehouse them in line with our allocation policy.

Under plans reportedly being weighed up by officials, the tests could soon only be available in high-risk settings such as care homes, hospitals and schools. Boris Johnson is said to be poised to announce the move as part of the Governmentaposs strategy for living with the virus. The move would also see the NHS Test and Trace service scaled back, according to The Sunday Times.A Whitehall source told the newspaper: “I don’t think we are in a world where we can continue to hand out free lateral flow tests to everybody forevermore. It’s likely we will move to a scenario where there is less testing but where we have a capacity to ramp it upnecessary, such as in the winter.” The Mirror has contacted the Department of Health for comment.The claim comes days after the PM announced that from next week people who test positive on a lateral flow test will no longer be required to confirm their condition with a PCR testthey have no symptoms.After the rule change on Tuesday, people who test positive with no symptoms - said to account for around % of people with Covid - will no longer need this follow-up PCR test.They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.A decision to scrap free lateral flow tests would happen at a time when Covid cases reach record levels, with nearly . million confirmed infections in the past week across the UK.  The Office for National Statisticsestimates that one in  people had the virus in the final week of  in England - with Wales and Scotland not far behind with one in  and Northern Ireland with one in . Although the number of people being treated in hospital with Covid has risen to its highest level in months - the number requiring ventilation is at its lowest since October last year. Scientists say increasing evidence shows that the Omicron iant causes less severe illness. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Modelling group, told Times Radio: “The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new iant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. It’s very similar to the common cold that we’ve lived with for many years. “We’re not quite there yet but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term. It is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBoris JohnsonNursing homesPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This rises to % per daily serving during the teenage years. The study said: Reducing intake and or [substitution] with other healthier beverages among adolescents and young adults may serve as a potential actionable strategy to alleviate the growing burden of bowel cancer before the age of .Swapping out the sugary drinks for things like coffee or semi-skimmed and whole milk reduced the risk of getting bowel cancer.Nearly everyone survives this treatable and curable diseaseit is caught early, but more than , people die from it every year in the UK, according to Bowel Cancer UK.

The KFC in Northwich, Cheshire, is not the most popular fast food outlet in the world, in fact, many people who go there advise others to stay well clear.

The ubiquitous grease-mongers, serving fried chicken by the bucket load from here to Tokyo, where the KFC aposBargain Bucketapos has become something of a Christmas Day tradition.  And yet, horror stories abound about this particular Cheshire eatery.

Yes, some greenery would be nice, but this is certainly worth more than a one-star review, eventhe price made me squirm and the lack of chips was befuddling.Any optimism that the plucky wee Quorn burger fostered was extinguished by the pint of grease that was to follow, as I turned to the chicken. Though I will never , I was surprised to find a clean, pleasant establishment, a thoroughly okay place. Itaposs just a shame that they forgot to tell the food.

But that wasnapost always the case for Kate, who celebrates her th birthday tomorrow. As a teenager, she is said to have been shy and low in confidence after experiencing a tough time at school. When she was , she left that school and went to the prestigious £,-a-year Malborough College in . School pal Gemma Williamson previously told the Daily Mail: “Apparently she had been bullied very badly and she certainly looked thin and pale. She had very little confidence.”  However, at Marlborough, she sought solace in playing sports and then experienced a sudden turnaround that left every boy in the school rather flustered. And that turnaround is said to have come when Kate ed from the summer break aged . Gemma revealed that, after impressing school pals playing hockey and going cross-country running, the future duchess became “an absolute beauty” and “every boy in the school fancied her rotten”.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . Her former teacher, Denise Alford, also revealed that Kate was able to transform her look after losing one key thing - her childhood braces. “Pippa was a tomboy but Kate had lost her braces and looked stunning, she told the Mail. “She was apparently top of the ‘Fit List’ which boys would sometimes pin on the walls.  When Kate left Marlborough with three A-Levels, she embarked on a gap year before deciding to attend St Andrews University, where she met her future husband, Prince William. There Kateaposs self-confidence famously won over William when she wore a see-through dress at a fashion show. In , the then -year-old prince reportedly spent £ for a front-row ticket for the charity fashion show his future we featured in. Here he saw Kate walking the catwalk in a see-through lace dress revealing her black underwear underneath. The duchess is said to have made the transformation from Williamaposs friend to his love interest after he saw her in the fashion show and said: Wow, Kateaposs hot. That started their romance, and now  years on the pair have been married for almost  years and have three gorgeous children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

Darren told bemybet: “Kate Middleton has been a very permanent member of the Royal family since she first began dating Prince William nearly  years ago and as she approaches her th birthday, it’s clear to see how her style has evolved over the years as she’s established herself as a royal.” In the previous ten years Kate has become a mother who has brought three children into the world along with William. This has allowed her to display her family skills which have continually developed as she became a respected member of the renowned family. He added: “Her maternal instinct is often displayed through her body language, which too has evolved as she’s got older. “In many photos and video clips, Kate is seen kneeling down to the height of her children when she is talking to them - a gesture that is both nurturing and protective.  But he also pointed out that she is not afraid to scold the children and has taken Princess Charlotte to task in photosshe was was misbehaving. Other members of the family may not be comfortable doing this in public, but Mr Stanton claims Kate’s body language remains open and transparent. He says she is happy to deal with all things have to deal with while raising a family and is open and honest about it. The expert also said Kate openly displays affection to her children which Princess Diana was known for. Traditionally, the Royal children would be chaperoned while their parents carry out public engagements but, Mr Stanton says she and Prince William prefer to be more hands on with their family. The behavioural expert described her as similar to Diana. He said some aposcelebritiesapos and other Royal family members can appear like they are not being genuine, but the same cannot be said for the Duchess of Cambridge. He described Kate as being happy to provide support to others and says it shows she cares.

Turning up the temperature on the appliance to  degrees Fahrenheit, the man put the burger in the appliance and put a timer on for one hour to begin with, reported Manchester Evening News.The first  minutes elapsed but the burger seemed untouched apart from a light toast on top of the bun. The Twitter user said: “I sense I’ll be learning more about bread science than hamburger science.” But the heat from the air fryer quickly kicked in - making the burger rock hard in  minutes. In a clip, the bloke revealed the severity of the hardness by bashing the top with a spatula.  And after half an hour - the fryer was not doing the greasy food any justice. He said: “The smell is pretty strange, but not overpowering, strong ketchup sauce smell that’s described as “not great”.” With only  minutes passing since the last check in, the scent of the burger seemed to get a lot more potent. “The smell. It has become worse. It is strangely sweet-smelling, with a hint of fire, the foodie said. Unfortunately, the aroma of the Big Mac continued to overpower the house at the -minute mark. The thread continues: “Oh god the smell in the last few minutes has become thick, it’s vaguely tomato-ey and I can smell it across the house. “Air fryer is working, but I fear I may be buying a new one when my we finds out.” As the burger hit the halfway mark, it appeared not to have changed much apart from being “a bit darker, a lot harder. The burger lover claimed: “The inside remains nearly untouched.” But the bloke may have spoken too soon, as the inside of the burger started to wilt in the last hour. He added: “The cheese has become the consistency and colour of cheap peanut butter and is bubbling oil. “It has reached the texture of plastic, and the smell is best described as “hot ketchup” I am confident I will have to go past two hours for any real results. “It now strongly smells like fire and my we has opened all the windows and the front door.” With only  minutes to go, the food scientist had to whisk the experiment outside due to the “demonic” stench of the burger. As the burger sizzled away in the air fryer outside, he considered carrying out his findings for longer. He said: “ minutes remain and I am seriously considering an extra hour without the bun, which seems to be such good insulation it may overtake that delicious pink stuff in houses as two hours comes to a close, I am astounded that this is for sure still edible.” After deciding to stop the experiment after two hours, the Twitter user surprisingly found that the inside was still mostly unaltered. He said: “It appears the inside of the hamburger is relatively untouched and is very soft. Smells somewhat like homemade meatloaf.” He decided to cut into the burger and consume the well-cooked food. And the verdict  “It was terrible, absolutely disgusting”, the man added. But despite the scathing review, the bloke still rewarded the charred burger a “  stars.” However, the Big Mac enthusiast may be regretting his scientic experiment. He added: “It’s been about  minutes since I ate a bite of the hamburger, it is not agreeing with my stomach.

And that’s a move that may well pay off in April when gas and electricity bills are expected to shoot up by %. The looming price crisis is linked to a surge in wholesale energy costs. A big rise in energy bills is expected on April  after the price cap for households on default tarfs jumps. However, the price hikes won’t affect the , people in the UK who generate their own power and heating. Nick Rosen, who has been living off-grid for more than  years, reckons the number of people turning their backs on household bills has doubled in a decade. The author of How to Live Off-Grid and founder of Off-Grid.net said: “Some people go off-grid to save money, others do it because they’ve had enough of consumer society, then there’s people who are doing it for the environment. “But ultimately, its about freedom.” Here, we speak to four off-grid Brits who will never again have to worry about expensive energy bills. Ex-city banker in Portuguese wilderness  After saving £, in two years, former City banker Laurence Manchee went off-grid in . The -year-old and his we Kimberly, , now live in the wilderness in central Portugal. As part of his new lestyle, Laurence has to work seven days a week. But he reckons he can live like a king on just £, a year, which he makes from selling eggs, cheese and meat. He said: “It’s about living in nature and not having to commute to work. “We have to make money but we do it in our own time and you don’t need much to live, so you’re not just working to pay rent and the bills. We are now about as far off-grid as you can get and we have everything here now. “We do everything off the sun through the solar . “You grow your own meat and vegetables and whatever you don’t have can be traded with other people living off-grid. “You feel much more connected to everything because you are not buying what you need – you make it. “It’s a healthier lestyle and it’s much better for the environment.” Laurence, whose nearest village is Mata Da Rainha, added: “In Portugal, property is so cheap so when people want to do it, they come here. “It’s ridiculous. When you go to the DIY store, it’s full of English people buying tools to live off-grid. “You can buy a bit of land in the middle of nowhere and stick a caravan on it for £, soyou’ve got ten grand, you can be mortgage-free.” Family-of- in converted horse box  Initially, Matthew Watkinson just wanted a nice place to take his kids on holiday when he bought land in Wales in . But he soon decided to ditch his Essex home and go off-grid. The -year-old now lives in a converted horse box on a farm with we Charis, , and kids Elsa, seven, and four-year-old Billy. It was created under the Welsh government’s One Planet Development scheme, which allows homes to be built on agricultural land outside normal planning areasthey satisfy certain criteria. The family grow a lot of their own food, generate electricity from solar and wind power and make gas from food waste.  They also make money by selling eggs and honey, cleaning and teaching others how to live off-grid. Former vet Matthew reckons the cost of building the family home, near Newport, Pembrokeshire, was about £,. He says: “We still pay council tax, internet and for mobile phones, but there are zero utility bills. I love it – and getting rid of all those bills is brilliant.”See more of the Watkinsons’ off-grid le on Instagram @beeviewfarmingDivorcee in an £, caravan  Self-employed writer Lindsay, , lives semi-off grid in an £, caravan. Before she officially made the switch last June, the mum-of-two struggled to make ends meet.But Lindsay, who is on Universal Credit, has since cut her bills from over £, a month to £ in land rent and still has all the mod cons she used to enjoy in her three-bed semi.Lindsay, , who got orced in , said: “The houses I was looking at cost £ a month plus bills. I was paying about £ a month to heat my three-bed semi… the financial pressure was intense. “There were some landlords that just said no because I am self-employed. I felt discriminated against and thought, ‘Why am I working so hard to pay into a system that feels broken anyway ’”After buying a caravan on Facebook Marketplace, Lindsay, who is originally from Newcastle, moved to a patch of land near York with her children, who are aged seven and .She said: “Since I’ve moved on site I’ve gone through one Calor gas bottle that cost £. “We have mains electric that goes straight into the caravan and I have a lovely electric heater that is , watts at its max. The cost of electric is included in the rent of £ a week. “I don’t have the money to buy my own site right now, but I’m working towards that.” Tree surgeon and girlfriend living wild  The thud of bills being shoved through the letterbox is not a sound that troubles Matthew Plumb and his girlfriend Lauren Youngs. Eventhe tree surgeon did receive mail – which he does not – his monthly outgoings for heat, electric, water and rent amount to less than £. Matthew, , and Lauren, , have been living wild in a shepherd’s hut for four years with their cat, Baby. He said: “It’s mental how much money you can save. I spend nothing on rent, zero on electric as we get all we need from solar  and about £ every six weeks on propane gas. I have four pigs that I breed and  chickens we use for meat and eggs.” Matthew told how the couple are also planning for the future and building another room to be a kitchen lounge. Speaking from the woods where they live in Monmouthshire, South East Wales, he added: “We want to start a family and for our kids to live a healthier and happier lestyle than many people get in the modern world. “More and more people are taking an interest in going off-grid.

Annie Riley has toured theand breadth of the country, performing for ­veterans and care home residents. Her mission – just like Dame Vera’s We’ll Meet Again wartime anthem in the s – is to help people “keep smiling through”. And it was a pep talk from Dame Vera – who she first met  years ago – which encouraged Annie to pull out all the stops. Annie recalls Vera tenderly taking her hand and declaring: “Promise me that so long as you have air in your lungs, you will sing and share that singing with others.”  They met when Annie sang at a concert and it spawned a friendship that lasted until Vera died in June , aged . Last year, Annie, , and a band of song and dance entertainers working for charity The Not Forgotten did the star proud by performing for more than , Forces veterans and putting on socially-distanced shows at  care homes. Annie also helped organise  drive-in concerts for The Not Forgotten, which runs events to bolster the morale of wounded, sick or disabled veterans.  Her tireless enthusiasm has even earned her a thumbs-up from a royal namesake – the charity’s patron, Princess Anne. One of the drive-ins was at the Princess Royal’s -acre estate in Gatcombe Park, Glos – and Annie was in charge of the Christmas party entertainment at St James’s Palace. Mum-of-two Annie, from Charing, Kent, said: “The pandemic felt like my calling. I was feeling menopausal and thinking, ‘What am I going to do to help ’ and then it was clear. I knew I couldn’t stop entertaining because helping people and cheering them up is like oxygen to me. “Bless her heart, Vera really knew how important music was to people.  “I would never, ever compare myself with such a legend. But I thought about all the joy she spread during the war and when the pandemic started I thought, ‘This is my time to do something’.” Ex-pub singer Annie got a break with the s song duo Swingtime Sweethearts over  years ago. She and pal Le’arna Castle first performed in front of Dame Vera in . But they went one better a year later – recording the single Not Forgotten with Vera. They became ambassadors for one of her charities and helped organise her th birthday celebration in  with a concert at the London Palladium.The singers have also rubbed shoulders with Strictly Come Dancing ’s Anton Du Beke and celebrity chef Phil Vickery.Annie’s pandemic shows for The Not Forgotten started online in March . She also helped the charity set up YouTube music and message videos to connect with veterans, and a raft of stars contributed.  Annie – married to former pro wrestler John,  – said: “Dame Vera sent a message. Russell Watson sent footage of him singing with his dog. Sir Clf Richard sent footage from Barbados and some pre-recorded videos.“Brian May performed We’ll Meet Again on his guitar. Peter Andre and Jeremy Vine got involved, and Elaine Page, and some cast of the sitcom ’Allo ’Allo, who I have worked with, were also keen to help.”The videos were seen by more than , people. And not a single “hit” is not lost on Annie, who said: “You can’t change the world but you can change somebody’s world.”  When lockdown eased, Annie and her fellow entertainers kicked off their -gig care home tour. Each event ­represented a year of The Not Forgotten’s centenary. Annie added: “Sadly, I’ve met veterans with PTSD who thought of taking their own lives and I heard even more of that during the pandemic. Some have said, ‘You have saved me’ just by spreading that bit of joy. “I was at one home when a lady came up and said, ‘Thank you. You have given me my mother back for an hour’.  She could see the old mother had ed, dancing and enjoying the music. It was ­overwhelming to hear that. “We were all tearing up. Of everything I’ve done in my le – including performing in front of the Queen at the Palladium ­concert – nothing compares with knowing the good we’ve done in those homes. “At St James’s Palace, Princess Anne turned to me and said, ‘I’m so thrilled with what the charity has achieved in the most dficult of years’.”  Two years ago, Annie worked with Good Morning Britain on a loneliness prevention campaign – an issue close to her heart. She said: “I’ve always cared about the older generation. My dad died when I was young. I was brought up by my grandparents and mother. I’d sit on grandad John’s knee and sing. “When he got Alzheimer’s, he had to be put in a care home. When I visited it was like God’s waiting room, so I had to do something – and I volunteered to sing. Before I knew it, I was singing five days a week at dferent homes. Grandad died  years ago but when the pandemic hit I knew I had to keep cheering the elderly on.” At one event, Annie met a woman whose son was left disabled after being wounded on duty with the Royal Marines. The mum was in tears of joy at seeing him dancing.  Annie said: “I could see what a big thing that was. That sums it up for me. The Not Forgotten concerts take a bad situation and add a bit of sunshine to people’s lives – that there is light within the darkness. “We’re hoping to do more in .

After becoming a surrogate for the first time  years ago, the mum of four says the feeling of handing over the baby and seeing the coupleaposs instant and unconditional love for the child can be addictive. All of her surrogate pregnancies have been through in vitro fertilisation , meaning the coupleaposs fertilised egg is implanted in Lauraaposs womb so genetically none of the babies are hers.The single mum from Bradley, Huddersfield, told ExaminerLive : I love being a mum, it’s the best job in the world, and I love that I can help someone fulfil their dream to become a parent. Speaking of the moment she gets to pass the newborn over to the intended parents, she said: Once you see the baby in their arms you can see that unconditional love immediately. It is just so worth it. That feeling can be slightly addictive. Inspired by a TV programme, mum to April, , Rowan, , Ada, six, and Eira, two, decided to become a surrogate for the first time after the births of her first two children. That unconditional love that I felt, I thought how lucky I was to have that and so thoughtI could help others, then why not  Once they are old enough they will know who I am and that they grew in my tummy. She said. A decade on, she recently lost over st so that she could carry on and have a tenth baby for a single man with a donated egg, but is yet to become pregnant.  Laura who now weighs st explained: Having had nine babies, and definitely wanting more, I couldn’t risk a tenth baby whilst being so overweight because of the associated risk factors. Before starting the process, Laura gets to know the intended parents she is working with and stays in touch afterwards, adding that when the children are old enough they will be told how they were born. Once they are old enough they will know who I am and that they grew in my tummy. Laura adds. However there are misconceptions around surrogacy Laura says, including myths that surrogates make lots of money and concerns that they will become attached to the baby. People think I would be attached to the baby. Of course, I want to keep that baby safe, but you donapost have the same feelingstowards your own child when you are pregnant with someone aposs. She says.  Under UK law, surrogates cannot be paid except for reasonable expenses such as clothes and medication. In the UK, surrogacy is altruistic. Expenses are covered, such as travel and maternity clothes. Laura says, adding that some people ask funny questions like aposdo you know who you are doing it for apos. Yes, I would not have a baby for a stranger. she answers. But there are some concerns more personal to Laura as the number of children she has given birth to approaches double figures. Laura said: I do get asked that. It is a sensible question.  I would like to carry on helping people to have their family. If my body gets to the stage where it is struggling with pregnancy, orI get health problems or the birth is not going well, that is where a line will need to be drawn because my children need a mum.I never rule anything out, I play everything by ear. I have always coped well with pregnancy and have had straightforward births. Despite some initial shock and concern from her grandparents over her first surrogate baby, Laura says she has the full backing of her family, who would be surprisedshe stopped. Itaposs so normal to my family they would be shockedI wasnapost having more...my mum is my biggest support regarding surrogacy. She supports me in doing what I do. She added: Twelve years ago, when I first started to do it, they had a lot of misconceptions. They were a little bit shocked and thought I shouldnapost do it.

Nikki Panner weighed more than  stonesand was unhappy in her own skin. She was desperate for some lovely pictures with her then-three-month-old daughter, but hated seeing herself. The -year-old mum had struggled with her weight and couldnapost look at herself.Nikki told MyLondon she had tried dferent diets and struggled to find one which worked for her.She said: I remember that Christmas We were taking photos, and I just did not like myself. In one photo, I hated myself in it. Iaposd been struggling with my weight for a few years at that point, I just wanted to feel happy.Following a suggestion from her mum, Nikki signed up to her local Slimming World group to begin her weight loss journey.Sheaposd tried many dferent diets in the past but never found one that worked for her, partly because sheaposd never really taken the time to cook for herself and her family, or spend time preparing nutritious, tasty meals. I barely cooked before, I never really took the time to, she explained. I [also] wasnapost really active at that point: Iaposd had a C-section and I had quite a bad recovery, so I couldnapost be too active. But I had time in the evening where I was able to just cook, so I found loads of Slimming World recipes that had what we call aposfree foodapos. I spent that time for myself cooking dinner for my family. Slimming Worldaposs aposfree foodsapos are healthy staples that make up the bulk of a nutritious meal, and members are encouraged to eat as much aposfree foodapos as they like, until they feel full. They include things like lean meat and meat replacements, fish, dairy, eggs, pasta, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit - the main healthy food groups that are incorporated into a balanced meal. Nikki, from Hillingdon, west London, said: It was just small changes in the foods I was eating, the way I prepared food, and it just fit into my lestyle. They were average meals that weaposd have every day beforehand, but I learned how to cook them better. I started to really enjoy it, to learn [how to cook], it taught me a lot long-term and changed the way I looked at food. No foods are banned, so I never felt like I was restricted, she added. When I joined [Slimming World] I was breastfeeding, and obviously I needed extra calcium and fibre so Slimming World added that into my plans, I never felt like I had to give up or sacrice anything - I could even have a chocolate barI needed to. As Nikki started to sht the pounds through enjoying a balanced diet of nutritious, filling meals - and still enjoying the odd treat to avoid unsustainable, restrictive dieting - she felt able to be more active and found it easier to move more. She began walking with her daughter as a relaxed way to exercise, and appreciated not feeling forced to go to the gym or endure strenuous exercise by her slimming plan. Her weight loss didnapost feel real until she saw photos of herself after losing around five stone. She noticed a stark dference in how she looked compared to the photos she hated from Christmas, and started to feel more confident in her own skin. After reforming her diet in January , by August Nikki had lost six stone, or  kilograms. This hasnapost only transformed her body image, but also her family le: losing the weight helped Nikki, who has polycystic oy syndrome , conceive her second child. Getting pregnant is dficult for people with PCOS, and one of the main symptoms of the condition is weight gain, which can make it even harder. Losing so much weight is, therefore, a twofold success for Nikki, who feels happier and healthier while getting ready to welcome another child into the world. My doctors said it was going to be really dficult for me [to get pregnant], but I think losing the weight really helped, she said.Iaposm already noticing a dference in this pregnancy : Iaposm going up the stairs so much quicker, I just feel more active, which is really nice.While Nikki continues her new lestyle, sheaposs also about to embark on a new career as a Slimming World consultant, helping other people achieve their goals - she couldnapost be more excited about her new job, or more proud of how far sheaposs come.

So I’m afraid I have absolutely NO sympathy with Djokovic – the multi-millionaire sportsman now being compared to Jesus because of his victimisation. His family in Serbia claim the Aussies are trying to “crucy” him and use him as a political pawn. Come off it! Djokovic may be stuck in a grotty hotel room rather than the * palaces he’s used to, but at least he has a bed, a shower and hot meals. I had a row of hard plastic seats, wet wipes and a couple of stale sandwiches. Djokovic also has the enormous privilege of being a hero and role model to millions of young people. That makes his behaviour even more pathetic. He should set an example, not act like a brattish young McEnroe and kick off when things don’t go his way. As old rival Rafa Nadal said, Djokovic “knew the conditions a lot of months ago, so he made his own decision. I believe in what the people who know about medicine say - andthey say we need to get vaccinated, we need to get the vaccine”. Let’s hope young tennis fans follow in Rafa’s footsteps and give No-vax the contempt he deserves.

In May, Bill Green, , found himself unable to breathe and was rushed to AE where his heart stopped.But thankfully he survived and his relieved family were so elated they clubbed together to buy a mobility scooter - which would allow him to get out and about.Heaposs now distraught after this leline which helped him socialise was taken from outside the Crowaposs Nest pub in Longhill, Hull, where he was playing Bingo on Wednesday night, Hull Live reports.There are reports a group of youths took his scooter.His family and friends then searched the area for the scooter and it was found just a short distance away on Holderness Road and was trashed beyond repair.Bill’s daughter Julie Green, of Longhill, is now pleading for information to trace those responsible. My dad had gone to the Crow’s Nest pub to play bingo and he left his scooter outside,” she said. “The regulars who go out for a smoke always keep an eye on it but there was a short period when no one was outside and it was taken at around pm on Wednesday. “We all went searching for it and it was found at am the next day less than a mile away. It was completely smashed up.”  While the gratuitous act helped pass a few minutes of time for those involved, the impact will last much longer for Bill. “The scooter was a leline for my dad,” Julie said. “In May he could not breathe and he was taken to hospital by ambulance where his heart stopped. We were told by the medical staff he would not survive but somehow he did.Even after this, he ended up with Covid for  days. He now has a ventilator every night as he canapost get carbon dioxide out as his diaphragm is too weak.“His legs swelled up after and he cannot walk far anymore. “It was such a massive thing for us that he survived, we decided to all chip in and buy him a mobility scooter.” Not only has Bill lost the scooter, but he now also feels responsible for leaving it unattended. “The scooter has become very important to him and has become a le support,” Julie said. “We are all very, very frustrated. If they had taken it to sell and make money at least it would make more sense but what they have done is so pointless.  “They just took it and then destroyed it. We can’t understand why they have done this. “My dad now feels guilty for leaving it outside when everyone helped pay for it. “He has been crying over what happened and so have I. There has been a bit of good news after the family posted about the theft on social media. “After we put something on social media someone has kindly come forward and lent him a scooter for a few weeks but we don’t know what will happen after that,” Julie said “Unfortunately, the scooter was uninsured and we cannot afford to get him a new one. Julie has a message to those who stole and then trashed the scooter. “Why ” she said, “What have you gained from doing that  “It is just a pointless act that has taken an elderly man’s leline away. If my dad just ends up stuck in the house all day then he will go downhill massively.” Humberside Police are now appealing for anyone with information to come forward.A spokeswoman said: “We are investigating the theft of a mobility scooter which was reported as stolen from Douglas Road in Hull on Wednesday, January  between pm and pm. “The blue and black scooter was left securely outside and was stolen leaving the elderly owner very distressed and vulnerable. “The scooter was later found abandoned and damaged on Holderness Road. “We are appealing for anyone with information that would help identy the person who stole the scooter to call us on our non-emergency number  quoting reference   .”Julie has now organised a GoFundMe page to raise money for a new scooter which has already topped £,.

He said the sex allegations surrounding the Duke of York and his links to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell were “embarrassing for everyone”. The former commanding officer of the Royal Irish Regiment – of which Andrew is Colonel-in-chief – also said the royal should “jump before he is pushed”. Col Collins, , whose inspirational eve-of-battle speech to his battalion in  won him worldwide attention, is the first former military chief to comment publicly on the allegations against Andrew – which the Prince denies. He met the Duke in his honorary role – one of his nine military titles – around the time of the Iraq War.  Col Collins, who also served in the SAS, said the best course of action the Duke could now take to save the Royal Family from further embarrassment is to resign his military titles. The Belfast-born ex-officer said: “The publicity surrounding [Prince Andrew] is embarrassing for everyone. “It is entirely up to him and what he decides to do at the end of the day. “He will listen to advice from the rest of the royal family, he’s got his own mind, it’s going to be better for everybodyhe took the decision and jumped rather than was pushed. “I don’t think he’ll ever ride the storm out. That is the bottom line because I think that the damage has been done.  “I think it’s a question of timing and I think that he’ll decide to jump or some more senior members of the royal family will say you’ve got to go. “There is one of two ways this could have gone – you either go immediately and say I’ll clear my name and come back, which is the right thing to do ­always or try, and tough it out. “If you tough it out, you better hope to God that you come out of it. “The most likely outcome, in my opinion, is that he will be cleared and then at that point it will be the right point for him to say, ‘I haven’t been convicted of anything but the detritus around it means that I should make way for a younger royal in respect of the people I am Colonel-in-chief of’. “I don’t think we will have to wait very many weeks for that to happen.” Col Collins, who received the OBE from Prince Charles in  for his ­service in Iraq, wasalso scathing about Andrew’s ­disastrous ­interview on BBC’s Newsnight in .Andrew is being sued in a US court by Virginia Giuffre, , who alleges she was forced to have sex three times with him in  when she was , including once in London. The Duke strongly denies all of her allegations. During the BBC interview, he claimed he could not have sexually assaulted Ms Giuffre – who claims he was sweating profusely as they danced in a London nightclub – because he “doesn’t sweat” and was dining in a pizza restaurant at the time of the alleged offence. Col Collins said: “Every person who I know who advised him said do not do that BBC interview, do not enter into any litigation and say nothing. “Ninety-nine per cent of people condemn themselves out of their own mouth and he dug a bloody big hole with that interview.”  The Sunday People has also learnt that a serving senior officer is planning to write to Andrew calling on him to give up all his military titles. A source has claimed that the officer believes the Prince is in denial about the damage he is causing to the reputation of the military. Senior defence sources have also said that there is no support or sympathy for the Duke at the most senior armed forces ranks. Col Collins spoke out after the Sunday People revealed last week the Queen will reluctantly strip her son of military titleshe does not resign. The move is likely to be a devastating blow to Her Majesty, who was said to be deeply upset after Prince Harry was forced to stand down from his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines last year because he had given up other royal duties.  But defence sources say the Army’s most senior commanders believe it is now impossible for the Duke to continue in his role as the Colonel-in-chief of nine military regiments, units and corps. Andrew currently holds the honorary title of Colonel of the regiment in the Grenadier Guards and is the Colonel-in-chief of the  th Lancers, the Royal Irish Regiment, the Yorkshire Regiment, the Small Arms School Corps and Royal Colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers. He is also Honorary Air Commodore of RAF Lossiemouth, Commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm and Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps. The Ministry of Defence and the Palace declined to comment. Last night Andrew, , was anxiously awaiting a ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan over whether he will face a full civil court case over Ms Giuffre’s allegations. It was reported yesterday that one of the witnesses in the Maxwell trial claims Ms Giuffre told her she had slept with Andrew in London. Carolyn Andriano, , who waived her right to anonymity, said Ms Giuffre texted her from London in March  to say she was going for dinner with Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein. She also claimed Ms Giuffre had shown her the infamous picture of her posing with Andrew at Maxwell’s home. Ms Giuffre is alleged to have shown the picture to Carolyn back in Florida, saying of the Prince: “I got to sleep with him.” Carolyn reportedly said: “She didn’t seem upset about it. She thought it was pretty cool.” Maxwell, , was found guilty last month of child sex trafficking and could face up to  years in a US jail. Depraved Epstein was found dead in his cell in , aged , while ­awaiting trial.

New York judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision on whether the Duke will face a full civil trial is expected soon. He has already decided there is no case to answer on the “domicile ­argument” over Ms Giuffre’s residency in Australia but a source has told the Mirror that Andrew’s legal team “are not taking this lying down”.  His lawyers believe they have found a new angle to stop Ms Giuffre’s case, as federal law explicitly bans two parties who are not US residents facing each other in court. The source said: “They believe they have a genuine argument to get this thrown out. If they can prove under federal law where Ms Giuffre has filed her case, that there is precedent not to bring a case where both parties are not US residents, then it should be halted immediately.” Ms Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with the Duke on three occasions in , has lived in Australia since . Our source said: “Eventhe judge rules that there is a case for a full trial, there is a long way to go.”  The Duke’s attorney, Andrew Brettler, said Ms Giuffre was living in a £million home in Perth, Australia, when she filed her lawsuit and had spent less than two years in the US since moving to Australia in . The claimant’s team has a deadline of January  to prove -year-old Ms Giuffre’s residency status. Prince Andrew’s former we Sarah, , today declared it was “onwards and upwards” as she ed from a skiing holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, at the £million chalet the Duke is having to sell to pay his legal bills, which have topped £million. The Duke has always “absolutely and categorically” denied the allegations against him. But the Queen will not pay her son’s costs and “would not assist” him in paying a financial ­settlement to Ms Giuffre.  It has been claimed a million – £.million – out of court settlement would be turned down by Ms Giuffre, leaving the Duke at risk of a far higher payouther case goes ahead in the autumn and is settled by a jury. Previously, Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer for some of Epstein’s victims, told the MirrorAndrew is found guilty the damages could “easily” top £million. He said: “A jury is not limited by anything. To punish somebody worth a billion dollars, you have got to hit them in their pockets and punish them accordingly.” If Judge Kaplan does decide that the case should go to trial, insiders have said the option to settle out of court “remains on the table”. One source said: “No discussions have been had regarding a financial settlement – the Duke wants to clear his name. “This is a US civil litigation, being fought in a US court with US lawyers – and given that the vast majority of US civil litigation is settled out of court, it would always remain an option on the table.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCrimeBillionairesDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

With the world’s eyes on a possible civil court case over sex abuse claims in the US, the Duke of York stayed at home. He was literally a virtual recluse – using Skype for video calls to his people in Verbier, Switzerland. We can reveal he had daily chats with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie and the rest of the party. A source told the Sunday Mirror: “Beatrice and Eugenie were both very upset because they were hoping their children would be able to spend their first ski holiday with their grandad and the entire family. “Sadly it wasn’t to be, but they did hold Skype calls with their father nearly every day while they were in Verbier so that they could support him and he could see the grandchildren on holiday.” Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  It is claimed Andrew, , had been due to fly out with the group. It included ex-we Sarah Ferguson, sons-inlaw Edo Mapelli Mozzi, , and Jack Brooksbank, , plus grandson August,  months, and three-month-old granddaughter Sienna. But the Duke got cold feet after his team advised him it would be “inappropriate” for him to be seen on holiday while facing sex allegations. And Andrew’s former pal Ghislaine Maxwell, , has just been convicted in New York of sex trafficking for Jeffrey Epstein – further complicating any ski jaunt for Andrew.  The Duke is anxiously awaiting a US ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan on whether he will face a full civil court case over allegations he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre on three occasions in , when she was aged . He vehemently denies the claims. Beatrice, , and Eugenie, , put aside the strain to enjoy the two-week ski break, before flying back from Geneva to Heathrow on Friday. Our source said: “Beatrice and Eugenie fully support their father and are a very close family unit, which includes Sarah. “It’s more about them being there for him and supporting him as opposed to questioning him about the case. That’s not what the family is focused on – it’s about survival, protecting the family name and getting through it in one piece. The girls feel their father’s name is continually dragged through the mud unnecessarily, when really he is a good egg.  “They feel the whole thing is an unfortunate business and they don’t believe their father deserves what is happening to him.” The royal party stayed at Andrew and ex-we Fergie’s £million Swiss chalet. But it could be the family’s final visit as it understood the ski-loving prince is trying to sell the lodge as he faces spiralling legal bills. He and Fergie, , bought it from millionaire French socialite Isabelle de Rouvre for £.million in . But it has been reported they still owe £.million and that legal threats were issued last year after claims of a missed a payment in December . It is believed Andrew and Fergie agreed to sell the seven-bedroom property to a wealthy European investor last September, but the deal has still not been completed.  Andrew and Fergie orced in  but they remain close and have been living under the same roof at Royal Lodge, Windsor, since . The Duke had Christmas lunch with the Queen at Windsor Castle, when sources say he was in “good spirits” after his legal team reportedly told him they believed Maxwell was likely to be cleared. But just four days later she was convicted. Then – hours after the ski party ed home – the Duke suffered a new blow with publication of a testimony from one of Maxwell’s victims. Waiving her right to anonymity, Carolyn Andriano, , claimed Andrew’s accuser Ms Giuffre had texted her in March  to say she was going for dinner in London with Andrew, Maxwell and Epstein. She also alleged Ms Giuffre, now , later showed her the infamous picture of herself with Andrew inside Maxwell’s London mews house.  Carolyn, who was abused by Epstein and Maxwell from the age of , added: “I asked hershe’d been to the Palace. And she said, ‘I got to sleep with him’. “I said, ‘What  You’re f****** with me’, and she said, ‘No, I got to sleep with him’. She didn’t seem upset. She thought it was pretty cool.” The claims came six days after the Sunday Mirror’s exclusive interview with Anthony Figeruoa,  – Ms Giuffre’s boyfriend in . He said Virginia told him she “didn’t want to do it” – referring to sex with Andrew. Anthony says she was “scared” by what Epstein and Maxwell wanted her to do. Andrew has always denied the allegations. ButMs Giuffre’s court case gets the go-ahead and she wins, legal experts predict she could get a £million settlement. She is said to want her day in court to send a message that anyone “with power and privilege” accused of abusing young girls will face justice. The Prince still faces the prospect of being questioned by US authorities investigating links to Epstein. Florida-based lawyer Spencer Kuvin, who represents a number of Epstein victims, told the Mirror: “He now has two close friends convicted, so it should make him very concerned about his future. “I believe the best way forward for him now is to settle. I would tell him he needs to get this case sorted out and fast.” On Friday it emerged the Queen will not pay Andrew’s legal bills, now £million, or any potential settlement. But he has assured her he is innocent and she still backs him.

Amelie Round was diagnosed with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia- which affects her lower body muscles, causing them to be tight and weak - four years ago. After years of struggling, there is now new hope for Amelie as she has been offered le-changing surgery in Missouri, US, that will give her the best chance of walking unaided - but the family need £,. The eight-year-old dreams of being able to walk independently and joining her sister, Saphie, four, as a bridesmaid for her parents. Her parents, Rose Moore,  and Jay Round,  of Hessay, York, plan to renew their wedding vows for their ten-year anniversary after the operation. Rose said: “After the surgery, the hope is the girls would be bridesmaids. “Amelie could independently walk down the aisle, which is something she couldn’t do now.” The pair were delighted when they welcomed their first child into the world eight years ago.  Until Amelie was -months old, they believed their daughter was developing perfectly. However Amelie did not walk like her other friends and appeared to be very unsteady on her feet, prompting a long road of tests and invasive investigations. By age four, she was given the devastating diagnosis of a lelong motor neurone condition known as HSP. Rose said: “Itaposs a rare condition that affects only around .% of the population The condition affects her lower body muscles, causing them to be tight and weak. “It makes it incredibly dficult for her to walk and balance is a real struggle,I leave her for a second, she just falls. “She also has weak motor skills. There isn’t really one thing which is easy for her.” After the news and arrival of their second child, Saphie, Amelie and Jay felt overwhelmed and as they adapted their lives and home to Amelie’s needs. The pandemic also had a signicant effect on the family and Rose had to give up her job as a solicitor to take care of the girls. Rose said: “It’s really exhausting because we have to watch her constantly. “There’s the emotional side too. It’s really hard watching her struggle.” Although she attends four physiotherapy sessions a week, the eight-year-old lives in constant pain. Rose said: “She gets upset because she doesn’t understand why she has to do her stretches. “She doesn’t understand why her mummy is making her do something that hurts her.”  Because her condition is so rare, Amelie’s parents struggled to find much information online. Rose said: “After the diagnosis we joined so many online forums and support groups to ask questions. “I don’t know what we would have done without them.” Every day, Amelie has to use a walking frame and wears ankle splints. This exhausts her and she struggles signicantly to play with her friends and little sister, who she adores. Amelie is sadly not eligible for this surgery in the UK, however Dr Park in St Louis Childrenaposs Hospital, Missouri is confident the operation will change her le for the better. Rose said: “For a lot of children it’s absolutely le changing and has miraculous results. “Ultimately it’s going to sever the nerves in her spinal cord – the ones that are telling the muscles to be tight in her legs.” “There will be a long rehabilitation process afterwards, but we are hopeful and optimistic.” However, the procedure is costly. Dozens of generous donors have contributed to a GoFundMe page for the brave girl. £, is needed to fund the procedure and give Amelie the opportunity to live her le as independent as possible. Her family are now hoping to raise money to give their young daughter this chance of to transform her le. So far, nearly £, has been raised and the family are overwhelmed with the support and generosity of their friends. To reach their goal, the eight-year-old’s family and friends plan to participate in some active fundraisers in Spring. Rose said: “We like to do a lot of community-based stuff and things Amelie can be involved in.” “We even want to do a danceathon then Amelie can join in in her own way” “She would love to perform in a dance show one day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Estimates from SAGEaposs Virus Watch Study - based on the daily activities of , people - found that outdoor sports was the activity with the second-highest chance of infection. But this could be linked to social activities linked to sports as well as taking part in physical activity, researchers said. Visiting pubs, restaurants and using public transport were also highlighted as activities which carried an increased risk of contracting the virus before the Omicron iant took hold. The study found that going to shops once a week meant people were nearly . times as likely to contract the virus. Going to a pub, restaurant and using public transport meant people were . times as likely to test positive for Covid between September and November last year. Outdoor sport carried a risk level of . per cent, the study - which has yet to be peer-reviewed - found.Unsurprisingly those who had to leave their home for work were more likely to contract Covid- than those who did not. However, experts were unable to present reliable data showing how risky going to the cinema, concerts or nightclubs was. According to the Virus Watch Study, the activities which carried the highest risk of infection were:Shopping - .% Playing a sport outdoors - .% Using a bus - .% Eating at a restaurant or cafe - .% Using public transport more than once a week - .% Going to a pub, bar or club - .% Going to a party - .% Going to a gym or indoor sports - .% Leaving home for work - .% Using a taxi - .% Using an overground train or tram - .%However there was no good evidence to show how risky going to theatres, cinemas, concerts or sports events were.  The same was true for going to hairdressers, barbers, nail salons or beauty salons. The data was collected before the Omicron iant began ripping through the UK in December. Today - more than , cases were confirmed by the Department of Health, bringing the seven day total to . million infections. A further  people have died from Covid- - bringing the UKaposs official death toll past ,.The tragic figure, the highest daily number since February last year, according to the Department of Healthaposs daily dashboard, means , lives have been lost to coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.It means the UK is just the seventh country to pass the devastating landmark, following the USA, India, Brazil, Mexico, Russia and Peru. Professor Andrew Hayward, who advises the Government as part of SAGE, said the UK recording more than , deaths after positive Covid tests were absolutely tragic.After hearing the testimony of a woman who lost two close relatives during the pandemic, the University College London academic told BBC Radio aposs PM programme: It is absolutely tragic and to think thataposs been repeated so many times is awful.I think we could have done better. I think some of the deaths are even more tragic for the fact that many of them were avoidablewe had acted earlier in the first and second wave.

Figures showed that three of the five UK areas with the biggest week-on-week rises in Covid case rates are Middlesbrough , Copelandand Redcar  Cleveland .Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick highlighted these regions, along with the Midlands, as areas of concern. He said cases in London are slowing down, but scientists need two weeks to seethis continues.And he said Omicron is possibly the first ray of light in ensuring Covid- becomes endemic and easier to live with, similar to the common cold.Dr Tildesley told Times Radio on Saturday: Most other parts of the country are about two to three weeks behind where London is in their epidemic profile. Particularly concerning is the North East and the North West -you look at hospital admissions in those two regions they are going up, also the Midlands, where I live, thataposs also a little bit concerning, so it is a worry.  On the slightly more positive side, so it doesnapost sound all doom and gloom, what we are seeing from hospital admissions is that stays in hospital do appear to be on average shorter, which is good news, symptoms appear to be a little bit milder, so this is what we are seeing consistently with the Omicron iant. In the Midlands, Northamptonshire leaders declared a system-wide major incident on Friday due to Covid-.Northamptonshire Local Resilience Forum, which is made up of NHS organisations, local authorities, Northamptonshire Fire and Rescue Service and Northamptonshire Police, issued the alert due to rising demand on services and staffing levels. However, Dr Tildesley added that Omicron is possibly the first ray of light in ensuring Covid- becomes endemic and easier to live with, similar to the common cold.He said: The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new iant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. Itaposs very similar to the common cold that weaposve lived with for many years. Weaposre not quite there yet, but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term. It is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe.  Hopefully, as we move more towards the spring and we see the back of Omicron, we can get more inter-relationship of living with Covid as an endemic disease and protecting the vulnerable. Any iant that does emerge which is less severe, ultimately, in the longer term, is where we want to be. It comes as as the armed forces have stepped in to fill a staffing crisis in the NHS caused by the rapid spread of the iant. NHS England data shows , NHS staff at hospital trusts in England were absent for Covid- reasons on January , up % on the previous weekand more than three times the number at the start of December . According to the Health Service Journal , staff absences across the entire NHS, including mental health trusts and other areas, for any reason including Covid-, may be as high as ,. In total, there are around , armed forces available on standby.  As well as a staffing crisis, hospitals are also facing the highest number of admissions from coronavirus since last February.A total of , people were in hospital in the UK with Covid- as of January , Government figures show. This is up % week on week and is the highest number since February  . During the second wave of coronavirus, the number peaked at , on January  . The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas advised the Government against giving a second booster dose, or fourth jab, to care home residents and those aged over , after figures showed it is % effective against admission to hospital. Experts are looking to prioritise the rollout of the first booster dose, as well as encouraging unvaccinated people to come forward for their jabs. Asked on Times Radiojabs would be needed every year, Professor Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at University of Bristol and a member of the JCVI said: I think thataposs quite a likely possibility. And I think you know, what weaposve got at the moment, vaccines are great in terms of their ability to prevent serious disease with the current iants. But as weaposve seen that protection doesnapost last all that long, and it doesnapost cross-protect against new iants as they arrive. So we need to go on improving the vaccines available. And we need to go on adjusting what weaposre doing all the time in the face of what comes up next,you like, so itaposs very much an open question as to what we will do. But I think use of vaccines against coronavirus is just going to be with us in the future. Yes, for sure.

The man offered his sister his room instead, but she still insisted she wanted the boysapos room as itaposs a lot bigger and she would have a lot more space for the babyaposs things, like the bassinet and changing tables, which led to arguments between the siblings. When I got home yesterday my son Noah was crying because he said his auntie took all their stuff from the room. Their toy chest, some drawers were moved into the hallway. She was trying to fit them into my room. I got so mad I made her put everything back, he continued. I really wanted to help my sister with her dealing with so much already but making one of my kids cry and trying to take their room was enough for me. She was told to leave, but the issue is she has nowhere to stay with a newborn baby. She had to go all the way back home to stay with our parents, and since they live far she had to quit her job which means she no longer has a stable income. She hasnapost stopped telling me Iaposm a terrible brother adding more issues to her le and my nieceaposs. She said she was only staying a few days, she was obviously planning on staying much longer. You offered her your room and it wasnapost good enough for her. You werenapost going to win here, one Reddit user commented. Another added: You offered her a home, up to and including your own bedroom so she could have privacy and space. Beggars cannot be choosers. She has no right to demand anything from you, and trying to take something that you have given her your reasons for not agreeing to is incredibly rude. Your job first and foremost is to parent your own children. And protecting their space and wellbeing is part of that.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The incredible home at Down End Point, a renowned beauty spot in North Devon, would see them make a drastic jump from their busy lives in London., with daughters Nicole and Lauren. And it wasnapost any ordinary style home . The five-bedroom house includes a four-storey tower from which inhabitants can gaze across the sea. It was set to include a further four bedrooms in the main body of the house, a sauna, a cinema and a ft glass-edged infinity pool with views over Croyde Bay. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Like every episode of Grand Designs, this one began with a sombre Kevin McCloud wearing a hard hat on site and warning the over-eager couple that they may have overstretched themselves. But Edward confidently told the TV presenter that they would be finished in just  months, and would spend no more than £. million. However, the project ended in disaster as the couple ended up splitting, while the family were plunged into millions of pounds of debt. But now the home has finally gone on the open market - for a whopping £M after Edward Short, , has spent a decade working on Chesil Clf House in a bid to get it up to scratch. The property featured on Channel aposs Grand Designs and was described as the saddest episode ever after it aired in October . And Mr Short hasnapost held back on what it has cost him personally, as he told thelast year: There’s no point in regrets, but obviouslyI had any idea of what it would cost the marriage and my family, I wouldn’t have done it. I had started it it’s not easy to back out of this. He added: There were quite a few days where I looked temptingly at the clf edge and thought le might be better down there, but that wouldn’t have helped anyone, would it  I couldn’t give up on that image I had of [the house].”  But despite all the problems, Edward remained adamant he would finish - and now estate agent Knight Frank has now announced the sale of the main house and its annexe known as The Eye. The estate agent described it as one of the most impressive waterfront homes on the North Devon coast. It comprises of five bedrooms and bathrooms, four reception rooms, a sauna and a cellar. The property will also include the three-bedroom studio annexe known as The Eye and double garage.  A Knight Frank spokesperson added: Chesil Clf House is positioned on a three-acre site between surfers’ paradise Saunton Sands backed by the impressive UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of Braunton Burrows, and the idyllic cove of Croyde, beyond which sits National Trust-owned Baggy Point. “Not only does the property boast high design and build quality, it also has a south-facing position and an ease of access to the water with a private beach and foreshore.” Christopher Bailey, Head of National Waterfront, Knight Frank, added: “Chesil Clf House will be the most signicant coastal property to come to the open market in the West Country for many years.  “It is iconic in the true meaning of the word and there is nothing  to compare it to on the market right now. “It certainly sits at the very top of the national coastal waterfront market and I have no doubt it will attract keen interest globally.” Edward said earlier the time was right to move on. He added: I’ll always be proud to have finished this. I owe it to my family to have a real end result, but the time has come to move on. I will have achieved what I set out to do, never deviating from the plans, and for that I’ll always be proud. The house has been anchored into the bed rock of the clf, painstakingly engineered to a level that leaves no possibility for erosional hazard. Edward said he had no option but to sell it to cover the large amount of money he had to borrow. He added: These past ten years have been a marathon slog - and I have got used to being a millionaire in debt. Iaposve accepted the only way forward is to finish and sell it.

For the ceremony, Kitten wore pink, arrived in a pink Chevrolet, and gave herself a pink ring in what must by the least white wedding in history. What do you think about Kittenaposs unusual wedding  Let us know in the comments... In a post on Instagram, Kitten shared the biggest day of her le with her fans, and she included pictures of her wedding cake, which was topped with a pink swan. She wrote: A very special thank you to @bigsugarbakeshop WOW!!! My wedding cake  cupcakes were fantastic! I am so honored to have you featured at the biggest day of my le! In an interview with KVVU-TV, Kitten said she had dated the colour for four decades but thought now was the right time to make it official. She said she got the idea from a child who mentioned marrying the colour since she loved it so much. Kitten’s love affair began almost by accident on her th birthday, as she was trying to work out what to wear to her party. She settled on a pink top, pink fluffy skirt, pink shoes and pink accessories. Speaking previously, she said: I felt fabulous. I thought,wearing that much pink could make me feel fantastic, why not wear pink every day   Going back to blue jeans and a white T-shirt seemed ludicrous to me. I didn’t want to wait until the next special occasion to feel pink-credible again. I wanted to feel and look pretty in pink every day. I sold my car so I had enough money to leave my hometown of Houston, Texas, and head for the bright pink lights of Hollywood. I like to say I’m a flamingo in a world full of pigeons. When I walk down a busy street during the morning commute, everyone’s wearing grey and black. There’s no expression, no iniduality. Yet people think I’m the crazy one! Over the years, Kitten estimates she has spent over one million pounds on pink paraphernalia and outfits. That sounds like a lot, butyou break it down over the decades, it’s no more than anyone  is spending on cars, sofas and soft furnishings. The only dference is, for me every pound is spent on pink, she says. From the moment you step over the threshold into her pink palace, everything is pink.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Weaposve all been there.But, while most of us have experienced the heartache of buying an out for a night out and it ending up being slightly too big or slightly too small - one womanaposs shopping disaster is in a league of its own. Kara Hall decided to treat herself to a plunging black sequinned wrap dress from Boohoo for her New Yearaposs Eve night out, and it happened to be an absolute bargain at just £... or so she thought. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the dress arrived and Kara tried it on, she released it wasnapost just plunging - it actually didnapost even cover the majority of her body.Taking to TikTok from the handle @karahall, Kara asked: What do I do  before adding in the comments section: Raise your handyou’ve been personally victimised by Boohoo Judging by the comments section, it seems like an awful lot of people were raising their hands, as dozens of TikTok users revealed they had also ordered the exact same dress and found the same fault. Nooo way, I ordered this and it looked the exact same on me, I was mortied. I had to send it back, one TikTok user commented, while another added: Omg I bought this too and sent it back for the exact same reason! Fortunately, Kara confirmed she had been able to alter the dress herself in the comments section, meaning it wasnapost a complete waste and she didnapost find herself without a New Yearaposs Eve outfit.

Model Nicole Sahebi took to TikTok to share her aposproofapos that social media is fake, as she used a simple trick to completely transform an image, as the Daily Star reports.Sharing the video with her . million followers, Nicole revealed she used the aposFace Appapos editor to change one image, and she said that many influencers use the app. The first image Nicole shared shows how she looks with the filter applied, the second is without the app - and while itaposs a subtle change it completely changes how she looks.What do you think about social media images  Let us know in the comments...In the pictures, Nicole is pictured sitting in a car with a full face of glam, and at first glance, it appeared that Nicole had perfectly applied make-up and plumped lips. However, the model revealed that this was just a filter. She then took off to the effect to show that she actually was completely bare-faced. Nicole shared another sultry snap of fellow model, Mya Ghorbani, in a full face of beauty products where she sported perfectly shaped eyebrows and long eyelashes.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere. But, again, this photo is not real despite it looking as realistic as it does. The model took the effect off to reveal that Mya was in fact not wearing any makeup, changing her appearance entirely. The beauty urged her fans that she does not use the app regularly but has just used it to demonstrate how ‘fake’ social media can be. Nicole explained in the comments: Guys! I personally don’t use the app on my pictures. I just wanted to see the dference because so many influencers use it. I paid for it just to see haha but then I cancelled. Stunned at the ‘proof’ of how ‘fake’ social media is, people fled to the comments to react to the video. One person commented: You’re literally soooo pretty without it! Your skin is so flawless. Another user fretted: I can’t trust no one anymore. While a third person voiced: This app should be illegal.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

After Chinaaposs lunar Yutu  rover snapped a mysterious cube-shaped blur on the moonaposs horizon in December, researchers from China National Space Administrationapossoutreach program Our Space joked it could be amoon hut .But now the object has been photographed up-close and the images beamed back to earth - and itaposs just a rock. At the time, its out-of-place symmetry and flat roof sent the internet into overdrive, with some speculating it could be alien abode. Experts had suggested it could have been a slab of rubble that broke off as debris after a space impact. The team in charge of the Yutu  Rover dubbed the rock Jade Rabbit due to its appearance and because the Chinese word Yutu translates to jade rabbit.  The Chinese Yutu  mission is the first in history to survey the side of the moon which is always out of sight from the earth. The rover took just one month to arrive on the moonaposs surface in January  after being launched in December . The explorer - which is powered by the sun - landed in the Von Karman crater - part of the Aitken Basin located at the satelliteaposs southern pole. The CSNA said the machine, which periodically shuts down until the sun is out, was clocking speeds of ft-per-hour as it made the long journey to investigate the blur.  Chinese space officials also shared its drive diary, which shows how the team navigate craters as they move over the surface of the rock. Around nine months after its landing, the rover discovered a strange gel-like substance on the far side of the Moon. The substance, which is described as having fascinating colours and a mysterious lustre, was found at the bottom of a small, recent impact crater.

Carabao Cup win at nearby Newport in August.But Redmond finished confidently after Nathan Tella celebrated his new Saints contract by intercepting Walsh’s pass and finding the forward with a measured pass.Southampton dominated possession and Valery, prominent down the right flank, saw an angled effort deflected over Ben Hamer’s goal.But the complexion of the tie changed on the half-hour mark when Valery was caught out by Liam Cullen’s diagonal ball.Valery thrust out an arm to block the run of former Saints striker Michael Obafemi and referee Simon Hooper considered the act worthy of a second yellow card.Saints skipper James Ward-Prowse dropped back to fill Valery’s right-back role and Swansea seized control before the break..removePiroe’s deflected attempt was comfortably gathered by Fraser Forster and Kyle Naughton and Flynn Downes skied over.Southampton defended resolutely at the start of the second period and should have been ahead just before the hour.Ward-Prowse floated a free-kick to the far post and the unmarked Jack Stephens sent his header wide of the upright.Swansea had created little but were level when Naughton broke behind the visitors’ defence. His cross fell kindly to Piroe and the Dutch striker blasted his th goal of the season into the roof of the Saints net.Forster saved Southampton in the final minute by sticking out a foot to deny Piroe, but the giant goalkeeper had no chance four minutes into extra time when Bednarek erted Olivier Ntcham’s effort past him.The lead lasted less than  seconds as Long set up fellow substitute Elyounoussi and the Swansea defence decisively went missing again after  minutes.Ward-Prowse crossed and this time Long was the unmarked beneficiary to seal Southampton’s fth win from their last six visits to Swansea and a place in the last  of the FA Cup..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Southampton overcome early red card to earn FA Cup win at Swansea"},{"url":null,"title":"evertons-reaction-pleases-rafael-benitez-hard-fought-fa-cup-victory-hull","story":"Under-fire Rafael Benitez was pleased with his players’ reaction to setbacks at Hull as Everton were made to fight for FA Cup progress.Having started the year with a deflating - home loss to Brighton in the Premier League, the Toffees won by the same scoreline after extra-time in East Yorkshire.The Championship hosts made le tough for Everton on Saturday evening, opening the scoring inside  seconds through Tyler Smith before Demarai Gray and Andre Gomes turned things around.But substitute Ryan Longman took the match into an additional  minutes before ing Andros Townsend secured a hard-fought third-round win when taking aim from  yards.“I think obviously we started with a big mistake but after, the reaction was very positive,” Everton boss Benitez said.“I was really pleased in the way that we were creating chances, chance after chance, so in football you have to take your chances.“In the FA Cup it’s even more important to do it becausenot, the other team grows in confidence and belief.“At the end, so we have a great goal from Andros Townsend but we put ourselves in a dficult position for a while.”Under-pressure Benitez was criticised by fans at stages of the tie, with some chants – and a banner – calling for him to leave.Askedhe was worried, the former Liverpool boss said: “No, what I said before the problems that you try to fix are coming from a time ago.“It’s not that in the last three months we have dferent issues, so the issues are similar and you try to fix that.“I have experience to do it.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"argylls own natural winter wonder","story":"Hair ice is a type of ice that forms on dead wood and takes the shape of fine, silky hair.It is believed to be caused by a fungus and occurs in hard and dead wood, although the reason behind its formation remains unclear.The conditions for hair ice to occur are fairly specic, requiring just the right temperature, moisture and wood type – and it seems that the #temperate rainforest# of Argyll provides just that.Dr Phil Anderson from the Scottish Association for Marine Sciencefirst noticed hair ice when he moved to Taynuilt from Cambridge  years ago and has begun looking into the phenomenon.He said: #Hair ice is not that common butyou want to find it, Argyll is about as good a place as anywhere in the world.#I first noticed it in my garden there was this fragile bit of ice sitting in the sunshine where it shouldn#t have been. I#ve since seen it up Glen Lonan and other places locally.#I#ve worked in Antarctica and studied how snow hardens but I found hair ice formation absolutely fascinating. It#s just weird!#Dr Dorothee Gotz works at Lallemand Aquapharm, which has a lab at SAMS, and shares an interest in hair ice formation.Lallemand Aquapharm holds a culture collection that includes fungus and, as a microbiologist, Dr Gotz recognised that the fungus responsible for hair ice formation would be worth including in the collection.She said: #I saw hair ice for the first time three years ago in Sutherland#s Grove, so I took a sample to add to our collection.#It#s a fascinating bit of microbiology. A fungus that forms ice and degrades wood is certainly of interest and could potentially have industrial applications.#Both scientists are keen to find out why this phenomenon occurs but say there is very little published literature on it, perhaps because it is so rare.#We don#t know what#s in it for the fungus,# explains Dr Gotz. #It needs to expend a lot of energy to create the hair ice and there is no apparent benefit to doing this.#Water is a problem for micro-organisms when it freezes, as ice can puncture the membrane. Perhaps the fungus is trying to expel the water before it becomes a problem.#Hair ice is most likely to form on dead wood with no bark. It also forms on certain trees more than others and prefers hard woods such as birch.#As a rough guide,the gritters are out, then hair ice might be out too,# said Dr Anderson. #You’re most likely to find it on a crisp, sunny morning after a clear night.

And the show features a certain number of expletives and hard-hitting humour.But of course, a show wouldn’t have become so successfulit simply took a chainsaw to the head that is the Mormon belief system and buried it in a shallow grave.What the writers do cleverly however is hold the religion’s unusualness up for examination, the unrelenting geniality of its elders who walk the globe, chatting on doors and hoping to convert people with unrelenting amiability. “We grew up with Mormons, and their MO is to beat you by being kinder than you and higher than you,” Parker explained.The storyline follows two Mormon salesmen, the highly strung Elder Price and dumpy, lying Elder Cunningham, who are sent out to convert Uganda.And so, we have a great narrative, a journey blocked by defiance, disbelief and dismay. How can you convert African villagers into believing that this American wealth machine can work in a world where people are struggling to feed themselves  How can you knock on doors made of wattling The writers make the most of this impossible task, and without giving too much away, we see Price and Cunningham sell their religion via cures for AIDS, which involves having sex with amphibians.It’s naughty. It’s at times outrageous. It has great songs. Yet, it doesn’t mock God at all.

A critically ill car crash patient who happens to test positive on admission can result in a whole area of intensive care being sealed off.An elderly person who contracts the infection while in hospital for other treatment might take much longer to recover a bed that might have been freed up in two or three days ends up occupied for two weeks.These are the real reasons why Omicron is pushing the NHS to breaking point.: Covid is spreading faster than we can test for it - but the infection threat is very dferent to March Cutting self-isolation from  to seven days - the other major change announced this week - should mean that a majority of Covid positive people canto work three days earlier. But it won’t apply to everyone.To be clear, self-isolation can only end on day seventhe person has no fever and tests negative on days six and seven.NHS staff absences due to Covid have rocketed Evidence suggests that roughly % of people will remain infectious by day seven, and the vast majority of these iniduals will test positive on an LFD. If so, they must remain in isolation for the full  days.As Professor James Chalmers, an expert in respiratory medicine at Dundee University, put it: \"If you don’t take a lateral flow test,you just exit self-isolation at day seven, the modelling suggests a % risk that you are still infectious, so anybody who cheats these rules is putting others at risk.”It is easy to understand why vulnerable people feel worried.But with Omicron spreading faster than our testing capacity can cope and critical public services, from railways to care homes, struggling to stay afloat, Nicola Sturgeon has signalled the Scottish Government’s intention to “adapt our thinking about how to manage the virus”.This is not about “giving up on trying to control Covid completely”, she insisted, but facing up to the fact that “the kind of measures that have helped us control transmission in past phases are becoming less tolerable and causing more harm”.By the end of November, overall hospital admissions were around % lower than pre-pandemic averages - up from around % lower at the beginning of the pandemic. Figures for December have not yet been published Before Omicron emerged, leaked documents relating to an exit strategy dubbed ‘Operation Rampdown’ revealed how the UK Government might wind down its pandemic response.The -page dossier envisioned an end to the legal requirement for those infected with Covid to self-isolate dismantling Test and Trace and scrapping free PCR and lateral flow tests.“We will no longer be prioritising the previous objectives of breaking chains of transmission at all costs,” it stated.: Sturgeon announces key changes to testing and isolation rulesOmicron has scuppered this for now, but mass testing and mandatory self-isolation will end.PCR testing is already being rationed to key workers and the symptomatic. Eventually it will be limited, as was at the beginning, to hospital patients.Lateral flows will stop being an everyday tool to gauge whether you are safe to socialise or work, but might remain important for entry into certain high-risk settings such as care homes or hospitals.Work is already advancing on the next generation of rapid DIY Covid tests, with a new saliva swab trialled in Singapore reportedly achieving PCR levels of accuracy in minutes.Self-isolation will probably be scrapped next for those who are positive but asymptomatic and fully-vaccinated, before gradually being abandoned altogether.Covid cases have shot up, particularly since Christmas Eve How exactly we get there depends on a tricky trade-off of risks, but increasing use of oral antivirals which can stop Covid progressing from infection to serious disease will be one part of the equation.If we’re lucky, the virus itself will evolve over time into something much milder, but Omicron-specic vaccines could get us there faster.The real Holy Grail would be a vaccine which not only cut hospitalisation risk, but stopped infections, as this would truly end the pandemic.Many consider this highly unlikely - maybe even unnecessary.However, scientists in San Francisco are currently working on intranasal vaccines - where a shot is inhaled through the nose instead of injected into arms - on the basis that triggering the mucosal immune system might prevent the virus invading the respiratory tract in the first place.There is no doubt we are at a crossroads in the pandemic, however.If managing the eruption of Covid vexed governments, navigating a safe path out poses the biggest challenge yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13360584.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-star-lulu-pays-tribute-hollywood-legend-sidney-poitier","story":"Posting on her Instagram page, the Scots star said: \"Sidney you were my friend, my teacher, my inspiration….“Sir rises above the fray and leads by example”…this was how you lived your le.\"You empowered and educated us do we could choose to follow your lead!

My job is to look at the schedule, make sure there’s a nice iety and try to second guess the audience.“I am viewer-led, I am not Government-led when it comes to creative ideas.”He said Channel  has a record of producing shows that reflect British values, such as Our Yorkshire Farm and Coastal Devon  Cornwall With Michael Portillo.: BBC should not just reflect views of ‘metropolitan bubbles’, says ministerThe Government proposals, announced by then media minister John Whittingdale in September, have been criticised by actor David Tennant, who suggested they were an attempt to push for more politically favourable programming.Pointing to high viewing figures from dferent areas across the UK, including Yorkshire, the Midlands and Scotland, Mr Frow said Channel  is “of the people, for the people”.“We’re not highfalutin, we’re not snooty, we don’t look down on our audience, we’re not patronising,” he said.Mr Frow said other channels including the BBC and Channel  had started trying to target younger audiences, but his strategy is to appeal to “as many people as possible”.: Even our national anthem ides this weird countryIt comes after ministers backed calls for God Save The Queen to be played more frequently by the BBC and other public broadcasters.Andrew Rosindell, Conservative MP for Romford, told the Commons that airing the national anthem would provide a “great sense of unity and pride”, and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries described the suggestion as “fantastic”.As the Government considers plans to sell Channel , with Channel ’s owner Viacom tipped as a potential buyer, Mr Frow welcomed the possibility of another creative opportunity.He said: “It wouldn’t be for me to decide about buying Channel … that said, I like any opportunity to be more creative.”"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-34-cardiff-10-five-try-win-leads-table-topping-success","story":"The home team’s first-half performance was superb, as Argentine duo Emiliano Boffelli and Ramiro Moyano played some delightful off-the-cuff rugby, andthe second half was more disjointed, the overall product was further proof of how far the team have come in a short time under Mike Blair.There were four tries before the break and one after it as the capital club went four points clear of Leinster, who have a game in hand. Yet for all that Edinburgh’s supporters can rejoice at the transformation of their team at the hands of their new head coach, Blair himself continues to insist that these are still early days in a major rebuilding exercise.“It’s not something I’m massively focused on,” he said after the match when asked his reaction to going top. “Its not something weve really been talking about. “The way that the fixtures have gone, the second half of the league is going to be tougher. Were going to have more away games, and some games against some quality Irish opposition in particular, but also some quality Welsh opposition. “Were pleased with where we are, because getting points on the board early on is excellent, but we dont want to get carried away.”Edinburgh had not played since beating Saracens  days earlier, but they soon got into their stride. It was Cardf who had the first sustained period of pressure, but a Magnus Bradbury turnover on the edge of their own  gave the home side a chance to counter-attack - and they took it with devastating effectiveness.James Lang made the initial break in midfield then fed Ben Vellacott, and as the defence closed him down the scrum-half passed to Ramiro Moyano, who had a simple run to the line. Emiliano Boffelli converted, then finished off a Mark Bennett break to claim his team’s second after Cardf had again coughed up possession.The Pumas international missed the conversion, but soon made it - with a penalty before another three-pointer, from Rhys Priestland, got the visitors off the markHaving made his team’s second try, Bennett finished off their third, touching down in the left corner just before making contact with the flag. Boffelli converted from the touchline to make it -, and that looked like being it for the first half until James Lang claimed the bonus-point try in the last play before the break. Blair Kinghorn and Jamie Ritchie did the approach work this time, and the forward’s short pass made it easy for Lang to finish off. The conversion was missed again, but at - the game was in the bag.Dave Cherry was on for Stuart McInally as play resumed, the starting hooker having been kept off as a precaution after a knock to his shoulder. Lock Glen Young then came on for his Edinburgh debut with half an hour to play in a half which was punctuated by injuries to Cardf players. The scrums had to be uncontested after replacement hooker Liam Belcher was forced off, and then No  James Botham needed on-field treatment for nearly ten minutes before being transported off in a buggy.Within minutes of play resuming, the Welsh side got a try back, with winger Owen Lane hacking ahead twice then touching down after Kinghorn had fumbled. Jarrod Evans’ conversion took them into double figures.After Magnus Bradbury and Ritchie had come close, Bennett had the last word for Edinburgh, slicing through a tired defence and going round between the posts to leave substitute Jaco van der Walt an easy conversion. “I thought Mark Bennett was excellent,” Blair added. “We’re heading in the right direction.” They certainly are, and, with two weeks of European action to follow, can sit back and take stock of their lofty league position before URC action resumes at the end of the month.Scorers: Edinburgh: Tries Moyano , Boffelli , Bennett , Lang .

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His cross fell kindly to Piroe and the Dutch striker blasted his th goal of the season into the roof of the Saints net.Forster saved Southampton in the final minute by sticking out a foot to deny Piroe, but the giant goalkeeper had no chance four minutes into extra time when Bednarek erted Olivier Ntcham’s effort past him.The lead lasted less than  seconds as Long set up fellow substitute Elyounoussi and the Swansea defence decisively went missing again after  minutes.Ward-Prowse crossed and this time Long was the unmarked beneficiary to seal Southampton’s fth win from their last six visits to Swansea and a place in the last  of the FA Cup.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I will try to do my best.“If some fans understand that, they will support the team. That is the main thing, to stay behind the team.“If they don’t understand that some of them, it’s fine, it’s up to them.“But I will continue trying to do my best, be professional and be sure that we can improve what depends on us.”Hull boss Grant McCann was proud of his side’s efforts across  minutes against Premier League opposition.“I’m disappointed to lose the game but in terms of the performance I was really pleased,” said the Tigers boss, who was coy when asked about Acun Ilicali’s prospective takeover.“I thought, ‘we’ve gone properly toe to toe with a Premier League team today’.“We pushed right until the end. I thought we had an equaliser at the end with Tom Eaves’ shot but it was a tremendous save fromBegovic.“All in all I’m pleased with the lads, proud of their performance and I said that to them in the changing room.“I said ‘you’ve got to be proud of yourself today because you’ve every bit matched Everton today’ but unfortunately we’ve come out on the wrong side of the result.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

At the moment we try it without surgery, but we have to look how serious it is.“It is always an alarm for me when theydon’t want to speak.“It is not good when they are not coming to me. But I will go to them every day to ask them.”The tie was played behind closed doors because of the Welsh Government’s coronavirus regulations.Hasenhuttl said: “It was a strange situation because we are not used to it anymore.“But I know that we can fight. I know we have a team with passion and high workload, but the fixtures this week now are coming very quick.“It does not get any easier with Brentford on Tuesday.”Swansea took the tie into extra time when Joel Piroe fired home his th goal of the season after  minues.Jan Bednarek’s own goal put them ahead four minutes into extra time, but Elyounoussi equalised instantly and Long’s first Saints goal since February  settled matters.Swansea had not played since December  because of coronavirus-enforced postponements, but this was a fourth successive defeat for Russell Martin’s side.Martin said: “I’m really hurt by the way we lost that game. It was not acceptable.“Going so long without a game has not helped, but that’s not an excuse.“We shouldn’t be conceding goals like their last two – one long kick and we’re opened up.“Our reaction to losing the ball was nowhere near good enough. But there were also some good things I liked, given the circumstances and the fact we were trying a new shape.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

For these groups, self-isolation will be replaced with the requirement to take a negative lateral flow test every day for seven days.The third change means anyone who tests positive with a lateral flow test, but has no symptoms, will no longer be asked to book a PCR test. Instead they must isolate immediately and report the results online so contact tracing can begin.People with Covid symptoms should still book a PCR test.Ms Sturgeon said the changes had been considered carefully on the basis of expert advice.She said they would maximise testing capacity and ensure a speedier start to contact tracing.#This stage of the pandemic is possibly the most challenging so far,# she said.Ms Sturgeon urged people to get boosted.No new restrictions have been introduced.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year. While onboard, Mavis learned to operate every part of the ship, from hoisting and lowering the sails to scrubbing the decks – even learning how to helm and steer the ship.  Brave Mavis also grabbed the chance to climb the ship’s rigging – a height of around .m from the deck.The Jubilee Sailing Trust promotes a unique mission, to give people of mixed abilities and circumstances the freedom to explore their ability, potential and place in the world through inclusive adventures at sea.Alongwith her team – called a “Watch” – Mavis was also in charge of lookout for other vessels or shipping equipment which may affect the course of the ship.There were four Watches over a  hour period, each getting a chance to experience le onboard a tall ship. Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public.

A second line next to the marker T is a sign of a positive result.However, many people have reported a faint second line on their test result, while others have seen a bold line after testing positive.As part of the Executive’s efforts to reduce the transmission of the Omicron iant, the public has been encouraged to take an LFT, otherwise known as a rapid antigen test, before leaving home.New rules around those who test positive for the virus has seen the isolation period cut from  days to seven — but onlyyou test negative on day six and day seven using a LFT.Read MoreCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  deaths and , new cases reported over the New Year periodFully vaccinated close contacts must also test themselves every day during that period.As a result of the increase in demand for LFTs, there is a shortage of the home testing kits and a lack of available slots for PCR tests at Northern Ireland’s drive through sites.Queen’s University virologist Dr Connor Bamford said that no matter how faint the T line may be, you are more than likely carrying the virus, and booking a PCR is vital as it is the “gold standard” when confirming the presence of Covid-.“The LFTs measure roughly the amount of virus in the sample,” he explained. “The amount of that colour is roughly proportionate to how much virus you#ve got in that sample.“A bigger, bolder line means more virus and a fainter line might mean less virus.“However, in both cases you#re likely to be infected. If the LFTs pick up anything, you are very, very likely to be infected.“In a couple of hours it can go from very faint to very, very bold and so in both those cases you probably have enough virus to spread that on so you should be isolating and booking a PCR to confirm that.“If you#re seeing a faint band you should be treating it as positive. You are positive, you are infected, soyou can see anything on that LFT you should treat it like it is Covid and you should isolate.”Dr Bamford said LFTs tell who is most likely to be contagious and infectious and are a great tool in the fight against Covid as they are so easy to use.“LFTs are very helpful and very reliable especially looking at asymptomatic people and looking at who is more likely to be contagious,” he added.UK Government advice on LFTs states “even faint lines” shows a test is positive.“Lateral flow tests used by the UK Government go through a rigorous evaluation by the country’s leading scientists,” the official guidance says. “This means they are accurate, reliable and successfully identy those with Covid- who don’t show symptoms and could spread the virus without realising.Lateral flow tests are not being offered in isolation, but alongside a range of other measures to drive down cases and break chains of transmission.”Most ReadComber family home is bright and beautulHoey urged to backtrack on ‘nationalist domination’‘My light’: Sinead O’Connor pays tribute to son Shaneafter his tragic deathWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean How a sailor from Belfast met his Carrickfergus GirlTop VideosPlayKate releases three striking photographs to mark her th birthdayPlayVideo: Meet the couple that inspired the song #Carrickfergus Girl#PlayKate and William pull pints behind the bar in Empire Music HallLatest CoronavirusPolitical games overshadowing our education crisis, says DUPUnder strain: Six key areas where Covid staff shortages are affecting essential servicesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: , positive cases and no further deathsCovid situation is ‘dire’ in Northern Ireland schools, says teaching unionLatestParents urged to book jabs for children as official Covid deaths pass ,Six dead after wall of rock falls on boaters on Brazilian lakeBrendan Rodgers suggests Leicester may seek to have Everton trip postponedHarry Maguire says Man Utd deserve criticism and they must justy wearing shirtMunster  Ulster  ratings: few stand out as province fail to make most of big opportunity in Limerick,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

During this time some members expressed concerns about his behaviour. He was living in a staunchly loyalist area of Carrickfergus while claiming to be a committed republican.At that stage he claimed to be an airline pilot. Questions were asked of employees of the same airline company and just as with his previous story about being a paratrooper, no one had ever heard of him.Around  McFadden was transferred by the company he was working for and became manager of a bar in west Belfast frequented at the time by dissident republicans.Those opposed to Sinn Fein’s political strategy and the  Good Friday Agreement were considered persona non grata in the republican-owned social clubs of west Belfast.The bar on the Falls Road where McFadden worked was frequented by dissidents, including one of the founding members of the Real IRA, Tony TC Catney.Catney died of cancer in . He was often seen in the company of McFadden who ingratiated himself with several republican causes.The New IRA is currently in disarray with blame being levelled at members from Belfast and Tyrone who were conned by McFadden.That rt is expected to deepen with the news that loyalists and later Sinn Fein members were able to quickly establish McFadden’s fake cover stories, yet the Real IRA and later the New IRA welcomed him into their ranks and elevated him to a position in which he was able to destroy the organisation from the inside out.Promoted to a member of Saoradh national executive, McFadden held the post of resource officer and was also involved in the financing of the party.His outing as an informer has led to questions about who was pulling the strings and where donations to the party were in fact coming from.McFadden claimed to know sympathetic businessmen donors — in fact this was all being controlled by British intelligence.In August  the eight men and two women were arrested following an MI-led operation which saw meetings arranged by McFadden in Co Tyrone in February and July of that year bugged by the intelligence services.The two houses were fitted with video and audio equipment and those present were recorded talking about what were alleged to be New IRA plans to obtain weapons and target Shannon airport for attack.They are also alleged to have talked about targeting a well-known Tyrone republican, claiming he had retained weapons that they wanted. Since then both the New IRA and Saoradh have been in a state of freefall.Among those now in the firing line are former north Belfast Saoradh member Dee Fennell, who was a regular at McFadden’s house where he had built a bar in an extension to the property.The home bar which was also bugged was frequented by Fennell and a number of others during the lockdown when hospitality was closed.Eyebrows were raised about the close nature of the relationship with the MI informer after he fled the Glengormley property last August. Fennell was not among those arrested despite being in McFadden’s company on a regular basis, however, he announced in July last year he was leaving Saoradh for “personal reasons”.A second north Belfast man who provided a vehicle used to transport people to and from the Co Tyrone meetings and who attended at least one of the gatherings and was present inside the house for a time has also never been arrested.Republican sources say this man was named as an informer in documents stolen from Special Branch headquarters at Castlereagh in .In March  some newspapers carried articles claiming that Tony Catney was a special branch informant, the information was said to be in the form of an anonymous letter from a former RUC man.However, the information against Catney had in fact been leaked by his former comrades in the Provisional IRA, and also came from confidential documents stolen in the Castlereagh break-in.Catney managed to shrug off the allegations as dirty tricks and the high level endorsement from the former IRA prisoner allowed McFadden to continue infiltrating the Real IRA.Sources say Catney had hatched plans for a republican supergroup, but they never came to fruition.In July  the RIRA merged becoming the New IRA. It was not the supergroup that had been planned but it did involve a collection of republicans from Belfast, Derry, Tyrone and Armagh.Catney was the New IRA’s ‘chief of staff’ — the organisation’s commander — responsible for directing ‘military operations.’McFadden by this stage was at times living with Catney in his west Belfast home, an agent at the highest level in the new republican terror group.McFadden told members of Saoradh he worked as a hotel safety inspector and owned shares in a bar in the Canary islands and used this as a cover for his frequent disappearances.He had also involved himself in a campaign launched on behalf of John Paul Wootton and Brendan McConville, who were jailed for the murder of police officer Stephen Carroll who was shot dead in March .McFadden attended court on the day the two Lurgan men were found guilty of the murder, accompanied by Catney and Mandy Duffy, also known as Amanda McCabe, who is one of those currently on remand facing terrorism charges linked to the MI bugging operation.While loyalists and members of Sinn Fein checked out McFadden’s cover story it seems that his latest career invention was accepted by the dissident grouping and its members.During recordings of the bugged meetings, McFadden was said to be “cool as a cucumber” throughout.Since the arrests of the group’s alleged leadership, the New IRA has been in a state of disarray — the Derry unit of the organisation has all but cut ties with the rest of the group.The man believed to be the leader of the organisation in Derry, Thomas Ashe Mellon, has retained a friendship with only one Belfast member, an Ardoyne man whose father was murdered by loyalists.They are furious at Kevin Barry Murphy, the highest profile of those arrested, as he appeared to be close to McFadden but was duped by him, going on all expenses paid holidays with him.Murphy, from Coalisland, was once described in court as leader of the Real IRA in east Tyrone.The fall-out is most clearly visible by what has been happening in Maghaberry prison.In December three of the eight men arrested in the MI sting disavowed violence during separate bail hearings — all were from Derry.Only one, Paddy McDaid, successfully secured bail, after a relative, former Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney, agreed to stand a surety. McDaid told a High Court Judge: “I don’t advocate violence. I don’t say that violence is a way forward.”Joe Barr, also from Derry, told the High Court that “armed struggle is counterproductive”. Despite this he was refused bail, but ordered off the republican wing at Maghaberry.Counsel for Gary Hayden told a court he was prepared to make a declaration to disavow violence to secure release from custody, however his bail application was refused.Barr and McDaid were removed from the list of prisoners supported by the Irish Republican Welfare Association— the group that looks after prisoners’ families.Only Hayden remains on the list, having backtracked on his High Court statement after being warned by Murphyfound guilty he would have to serve his full sentence with the criminal prison population.Only one other of the  arrested, Palestinian doctor Issam Bassalat, has been granted bail after suffering a number of heart attacks behind bars. He claims he was entrapped to attending the meeting by McFadden.Earlier this month a statement by the leadership of the New IRA appeared on a number of social media accounts, claiming they were “unbeaten”.The statement said: “The leadership of the IRA wish to make it clear, while others may disavow and abandon the struggle and their comrades, we are far from beaten”.A senior republican source said the statement was treated with derision, stating: “Those who put other men and women behind bars with their cosy relationship with a British agent are the last people anyone wants to hear from right now.“They’re not only beaten, but they’re finished and more than that regardless of what happens in the future they are no longer welcome.TIMELINEFEBRUARY : The alleged leadership of the New IRA hold a meeting at a rented property in Co Tyrone — the meeting is bugged by MI. JULY : A second meeting takes place in a dferent Co Tyrone bungalow, again bugged by the intelligence services. JULY : Dennis McFadden, a trusted member of Saoradh, goes missing along with his we and child from their home in Glengormley. Neighbours report blacked out vans outside the property. AUGUST : Nine members of Saoradh and a Palestinian doctor are arrested in connection with attendance at meetings organised by McFadden. AUGUST : David Jordan, Sharon Jordan, Barry Murphy, Amanda McCabe, Damien McLaughlin, Joseph Patrick Barr, Gary Hayden, Shea Reynolds, Patrick McDaid and Issam Bassalat appear in court on alleged terrorism charges. SEPTEMBER : A court hears that alleged members of the New IRA discussed bombing Shannon airport — the plot was discussed in bugged meetings to gain the trust of Islamic terrorists who would provide them with weapons. DECEMBER : Three of those charged with New IRA activity linked to the MI sting disavow violence in separate bail hearings — only one of those, Paddy McDaid, is granted bail.Related topicsIRASinn FéinMore On IRA PremiumGail WalkerOpinionAbuse spewed out on social media comes from decades of being schooled in callousness PremiumViewpointOpinionParamilitary threat still in the shadows PremiumFormer MLA Anna Lo on online abuse that forced her out of politics: ‘Trolls posted sex images of Asian women, linking brothels with me’ PremiumMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWhy deep-seated hatred may always plague this islandState Papers: Mary Robinson advised to avoid  World Cup tie between NI and ROI at Windsor Park as sectarian violence surgedMost ReadComber family home is bright and beautulHoey urged to backtrack on ‘nationalist domination’‘My light’: Sinead O’Connor pays tribute to son Shaneafter his tragic deathWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean Chameleon man: the MI agent who attempted to win trust of both sidesTop VideosPlayKate releases three striking photographs to mark her th birthdayPlayVideo: Meet the couple that inspired the song #Carrickfergus Girl#PlayKate and William pull pints behind the bar in Empire Music HallLatest Northern IrelandLiz Truss warns EU she is willing to trigger Article Five further Covid- deaths recordedDaily Covid- case numbers reach record total in IrelandSnow and icy patches forecast as heavy rain sweeps across UKHow a sailor from Belfast met his Carrickfergus GirlLatestSix dead after wall of rock falls on boaters on Brazilian lakeBrendan Rodgers suggests Leicester may seek to have Everton trip postponedHarry Maguire says Man Utd deserve criticism and they must justy wearing shirtMunster  Ulster  ratings: few stand out as province fail to make most of big opportunity in LimerickOlivia Rodrigo celebrates one anniversary of global hit Drivers License,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It hasn’t undermined the position of the Protestant middle class. There’s no evidence to suggest that,” he said.Instead, a person’s outcome in le is shaped by ious socio-economic factors, such as third-level education attainment, home ownership and whether or not someone attended grammar school, he argued.“What this society needs to do is have a conversation about social inclusion. We still have a situation where the majority of places that are deprived are predominately Catholic,” explained the academic. “You get within sections of nationalism and republicanism saying that they’re ascending, they’re on the march, and the Protestant community is dysal and failing apart.“You have sections of unionism and loyalism, like Kate Hoey who accept that that their community is failing apart and it is being undermined and discriminated against.”Mr Shirlow continued: “There is no evidence for either of those arguments. So what we’re getting is this sectarian-identity reading of the social changes. “Nobody in that conservation is asking us the question why people are being left behind — two thirds of the children on the Shankill and the Falls are not achieving five GCSEs.”He described the debate sparked by Kate Hoey’s piece as a “sterile Catholic Protestant conversation”, adding younger generations here find such labels “tiresome”.“I think the term ‘dominated’ has to be withdrawn. It’s basically taking the language of civil rights, that once there was a domination by unionists and now we have people claiming there’s a domination by the other side. If it’s not evidenced, then it should be withdrawn.”Most ReadComber family home is bright and beautulHoey urged to backtrack on ‘nationalist domination’‘My light’: Sinead O’Connor pays tribute to son Shaneafter his tragic deathWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean How a sailor from Belfast met his Carrickfergus GirlTop VideosPlayKate releases three striking photographs to mark her th birthdayPlayVideo: Meet the couple that inspired the song #Carrickfergus Girl#PlayKate and William pull pints behind the bar in Empire Music HallLatest Northern IrelandLiz Truss warns EU she is willing to trigger Article Five further Covid- deaths recordedDaily Covid- case numbers reach record total in IrelandSnow and icy patches forecast as heavy rain sweeps across UKHow a sailor from Belfast met his Carrickfergus GirlLatestParents urged to book jabs for children as official Covid deaths pass ,Six dead after wall of rock falls on boaters on Brazilian lakeBrendan Rodgers suggests Leicester may seek to have Everton trip postponedHarry Maguire says Man Utd deserve criticism and they must justy wearing shirtMunster  Ulster  ratings: few stand out as province fail to make most of big opportunity in Limerick,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

An exhibition will be held in the Millennium Forum and will run during the Feis Between April  and April . There will be a special prizewinners concert April  which will feature former Feis competitors such as Bronagh Gallagher, Margaret Keys, Gerald McCrystal, Eoin OCallaghan and others are yet to be confirmed. Feis Committe member, Patrick MacCafferty, spoke of more plans for the celebrations, As part of the centenary, I have been involved in recording a number of songs and music which would have been performed at the Feis over the years, he said. It involves artists that have gone on to make their careers in music such as Doreen Curren, Mairead Carlin and Fergal Murrey.The hope is to produce a CD which will be on sale. Also, a number of special competitions have been included in the Irish language such as, Write a manesto on your hopes for the Irish language for the next years, in poetry,a short favourite poem, in storytelling, a story or folktale about Derry.There are also musical competitions in every genre.  Patrick continued: Feis means everything to me. I have spent my whole le competing. I have been on the committee for some time. Easter has always been Feis week in our family.You may have got away on Easter Sunday, but the rest of the week was Feis. My grandmother sang in a choir at the first Feis, and my grandfather was on the second committee. My father competed in the Feis in the late th century and he was the official accompanist from  until he passed away . Feis is part of me. It is more dficult to sum up what it means to Derry. There is no doubt that in the early days it was the only place to express your talents, it was the only  for many but now thereare many outlets. One thing is certain that when you look at the talent that started their careers on the Feis stage such as Dana, Roma Downey, Frank Gallagher, Paul Murphy, and many more, it has done more than its fair share for this great town in taking our name abroad. In November , Derry and Strabane District Council voted unanimously to support theFeis Doire Cholmcille Committee, as theymark this incredible milestone. Commenting on the motion, Aontuacute Councillor,Emmet Doyle,said: “The Feis Doire Cholmcille has been a cultural staple throughout the last  years in this city. Going back to Tuesday, June  to Friday, June , , the first Feis which was organised in conjunction with the Gaelic League. It is steeped in history, indeed on the third day of the first competition around  participants took part. In the late s there were around , participants. “The committee that runs Feis is made up of volunteers, they put so much time and effort into this event, they are real cultural ambassadors when it comes to Gaelic culture in this city and district. “Over the hundred years of Feis Doire Cholmcille some of the best talent of this city and across the island have come through the competitions of the Feis. It is just as important to those who value gaelic culture as those who value the Jazz Festival, as Halloween, as St Patrick’s Day and should be treated as such.” DUP Alderman, Hilary McClintock, agreed the Feis is ‘an institution within this city’. Ms McClintock said: “Many young people have not only taken their first step to fame and stardom, they have developed confidence and self esteem which has stood them in good stead throughout their lives.” Sinn Fein Councillor, Emma McGinley,added: “A few of us will have our own memories of taking part in the Feis growing up. We have no doubt the centenary should be celebrated.” As part of the centenary year, the Committee are also doing a few exhibitions with pictures and memories over the  years. They wrote: To complete the set of  Feis Books for the Centenary, we are only missing the year, . Feis goers, could you please check your attics and ask your friends.It would be fantastic to have the complete  Feis.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Many people’s resolutions and goals for the year ahead often include giving back. We are incredibly lucky to have dedicated volunteers who come in every single week and give their time to be there for children when they need us the most. Last year, our teams of volunteers in our Childline bases across the UK had over , Childline counselling sessions with children and young people about a range of problems including mental health, abuse and neglect, family relationships, sexuality, grief, loneliness, and isolation. If you have a new year’s resolution, why not consider becoming a volunteer Childline counsellor  Volunteering can be a great way to give back to the community, whilst learning new skills. At NSPCC, we have an in-depth training process to get you ready for your volunteering role, as well as a hugely supportive team of volunteers and supervisors to guide and help you on your volunteering journey. If you are interested, you can visitwww.nspcc.org.uk volunteerand sign up to the next available volunteer information session, which will give you everything you need to get your application started.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January . Its opening hours on Wednesday, January  are pm to pm. The Shantallow Community Centre will be offering vaccinations on Tuesday, January  between pm to pm.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Hoey, who was the Minister of Sport in Tony Blairs government and now sits in the House of Lords as an Independent peer, wrote a forward in a report released by a fringe Loyalist group. In it she wrote: “I... support the ongoing work to encourage those, especially from working class loyalist communities, to engage in education and to seek entry to professional vocations such as journalism, law, and public service. “There are very justied concerns that many professional vocations have become dominated by those of a nationalist persuasion, and this positioning of activists is then used to exert influence on those in power.” Ms Hoeys comments have drawn widespread criticism across the political board with the exception of DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson who posted on Twitter that he welcomed Hoeys contribution. Susan McKay has refuted Hoeys claims as baseless and thatthere is evidence of Protestants under-achieving in education, then that is for unionism itself to look at and address. She said: “I found it really depressing to see Kate making comments that I would have heard in my own childhood back in the s. “When I was a child, I would have heard adults in the community that I was growing up in saying things like oh the post office is rotten with them – meaning that jobs that were traditionally held by Protestants in the Post Office were now being obtained by Catholics. “The notion that somehow or the other, Catholics getting jobs was something that was disgusting and to be avoided is very obviously sectarian and I think that Kate Hoeys comments, unfortunately, fit that model. “There isnt any evidence whatsoever of any of the things that shes claiming. We do have fair equality legislation. There used to be ways of excluding Catholics by finding out peoples names before youre offered jobs but there isnt any more. “Nor is there any mechanism to exclude Protestants. People have the same educational opportunities and I think the thing is thatthere is evidence of unionist under-achievement in education, then thats a matter that unionism should be looking at and addressing. “Kate Hoeys comments are very much reverting to a sectarian model of society but I think that most people would recoil from this. I dont think thats the way most people see society anymore. “Unfortunately, the worst aspect of it in a way is the fact that Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the DUP, has stepped in and welcomed the both the report and Kate Hoeys comments. “Thats the unfortunate part of it that someone like Jeffrey could have responsibly said, of course we encourage equality in all of the professions and we believe that all of our young people should have the same educational opportunities. “But instead he is supporting this sectarian approach which makes it seem asProtestants arent succeeding because of Catholics. Hoeys citing of the legal and media professions have led to concerns of the former MPs comments could inadvertently paint a target on peoples backs. Journalist, Martin OHagan was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries in Lurgan back in  and in , lawyer Pat Finucane was murdered in his own home by UDA terrorists. Pats son John, now the Sinn Feacutein MP for North Belfast, condemned Hoeys comments and Susan McKay said that Catholics who had scaled the social ladder were often seen as getting ideas above their station. She added: “We know of John Finucanes father, Pat, who was a Catholic lawyer who was murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries. “There has been a lot of evidence over the years of a pattern of sectarian killings during The Troubles of Catholics who had – to use a Northern sectarian phrase – got above themselves. “It used to be a common enough phrase in Northern Ireland when I was growing up. “This notion goes right back to the foundation of the state with Lord Brookeboroughs infamous ninety-nine per cent of them are disloyal comment when he was urging employers to go for Protestants lads and lassies as he called them.” McKay also said that unionists such as Hoey should maybe look instead at how unionism has stunted working-class growth in the Protestant community instead of seeking to place blame on aspirational working-class Catholics who have attained white-collar jobs such as lawyers and journalists. She continued: “My parents would have been working-class Protestants who had been able to avail themselves of the  Education Act. So it lted Protestants as well as Catholics because unionism has never looked after its working-classes. “The whole Orange system was meant to be that you knew your place andyou were working-class, you stayed working-class and you did what you were told by your betters. “It was a very rigid system and it didnt encourage people to aspire to better themselves. In some ways, what were seeing now is a playing-out of that. “There is a passivity still within the Protestant community that doesnt serve young working-class people well.” Hoeys comments and Donaldsons endorsement of them have been regarded as unionism whipping up support from its core voting base ahead of this years Northern Ireland Assembly elections. However, McKay reckons thatthis is part of their strategy, it could backfire on them. She said: “Its a dangerous and irresponsible game to start invoking those old sectarian ghosts. “The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to have moved us on from all of this. This is just an attempt to throw us back to the old days when everything was defined in terms of them and us. “Its just so counter-productive for unionism to talk like this at this time. Its so obvious thatunionism wants to keep the union, they need to make it attractive to Catholics and nationalists as well as to unionists. “But that kind of talk, now being endorsed by Jeffrey Donaldson, is far more likely to turn more young unionist people away from unionism than anything . Youre not going to attract any nationalists because its really insulting to everybodys intelligence to be spoken to in that way. “People may well just feel, roll on the referendum on unity, as we cant go back and this crowd dont seem to want to go forward. I think thats how it will work. It will just make people think,  this is the way unionism is going to talk, then there is no future for this state. “Its like the crocodile moment with Arlene Foster where a lot of nationalist people who were not particularly politicised were politicised by that remark as they recognised it as being really demeaning.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations. Use any unused stocks of rapid lateral flow tests that you may have at homeCollect from your School Universityyou already obtain test kits from thereCollect from your local PharmacyCollect from your local Community Test sitesOrder online at gov.uk   Fresh air  Opening doors and windows for ten minutes can help you and your loved ones stay safe.  Face covering  To protect yourself and others, face coverings must be worn in shops, indoor venues and on public transport. A full list of where it is required to wear a face covering in the UK is available on gov.uk  *Sponsored Content  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Pic: Claudy Rovers Facebook.Reporter: Liam Tunney Jan Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, A long-standing County Derry football club has taken the dficult decision to fold, citing a lack of playing numbers as the main reason. googletag.cmd.push Claudy Rovers, who competed in the North West Junior Premier League at their pitch, known locally as the Congo, announced the decision via their social media channels earlier this week. It is with a heavy heart that I write these words but after a committee meeting tonight the tough decision was made that the club is folding with immediate affect, they said. It just seems to be very dficult at present to get enough men to commit to a game of football on a Saturday and it has been a struggle all season to do so. The club would like to thank the efforts of everyone who has played, managed, volunteered, attended meetings, sold tickets, bought tickets, organised events, washed jerseys, sponsored the team and supported the team over the years. The team has given us many fond memories of trophy wins, trips away in the Irish Junior Cup and many a great days craic in the Congo watching the men in sky blue and white stripes all this won’t be forgotten.  County Derry Sporting Review: February  IFA inclusivity award for County Derry football club.   The news prompted widespread sadness, with many former members and former opponents expressing their disappointment with the clubs folding. Sorry to hear this I always enjoyed the games with Claudy Rovers with Curragh Rd and Newtowne. Always a hard battle on the pitch and great banter with them after, said one comment underneath the original post. Sad news many a battle we had in the Congo with Newbuildings but always a handshake at the end, the McDaids put some years into club, said another. One comment made reference to grassroots footballs changing status in modern society. It’s a matter of time for many other Clubs too. People used to mostly work Monday to Friday. Now they work by all week, they said. Football is less and less a priority for most now. It used to be the single most important thing in most players lives . Now after work comes everything  then football sadly. However, another expressed hope that the decision could be reversed at some stage. There may be a Phoenix moment in the future, keep focused, they said, adding Theres no Claudy with no Rovers.

Derry had led from early in the game when Niall Loughlin gave them the lead after just three minutes, and points from debutant Lachlan Murray and Emmett Bradley saw the Oakleafers lead by - to - at half time. Monaghan sprung a number of changes, and had five made by the time Derry introduced Declan Cassidy in the th minute, with Miacutecheaacutel Bannigan contributing - off the bench. A nd minute free from Jack McCarron nudged the away side ahead, but Ethan Dohertys immediate response levelled matters again. With the game deep in injury time, Kieran Duffy found room and sent over what the Farney men must have thought was the winner. Doherty though, broke onto a Matthew Downey through ball and with the whites of Rory Beggans eyes in front of him, tucked it between the posts to ensure Derry started the season with a draw. *Full report, pictures and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Claudy Rovers were founded in .

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

This body of work celebrates the humanism and psychological dexterity of us all, both inidually and as a gender sector.ldquoWorking as an inidual to support equality for both males and females is wonderful.ldquoBut, by working together to achieve it as a society. Then we are invincible and real change can happen.She added: ldquoThis is especially relevant during these unprecedented, pandemic times. Where the glass ceiling still remains almost permanently unbroken.ldquoMore importantly, domestic abuse has increased horrendously, behind shut doors during the  months of lockdown.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason is supporting the event.She said: ldquoWomen are key to the fabric of our society and the day to day working of our world. Yet, we still see women disproportionately under-represented in areas such as education employment and leadership. No doubt women are also disproportionately affected by austerity including the cuts to Universal Credit and cuts to public sector jobs.ldquoIt is sad that still today, women continue to face long standing structural inequalities that push more women out of employment and into a state of economic deadlock.Taking a male view point on the subject, Cllr Glyn Hanna said: ldquoI have been involved in politics for years and also have a business. I have seen on many occasions that there remain equality issues for women in work places.ldquoI have three daughters who all have professional jobs. I have been told by them of their experiences of sexual discrimination and inequality and their feelings that they have to work harder to get respect doing a job. More work does need done to address this problem urgently.Agreeing with both councillors, Lise said: ldquoWhat the councillors are saying is so true. So passionate am I to keep female equality high on the public agenda, itrsquos the focus of the creation and touring of this exhibition. It is at the core of my lsquoI Am Womanrsquo Arts and Cultural Programme.She added: ldquoI am focused on promoting all forms of equality and ersity in Northern Ireland.The I Am Woman programme was first launched at Parliament Buildings, Stormont, in September and was attended by MLAs and VIPs.But Lisersquos work is not just focused at reaching the ear of politicians.She said: ldquoMy personal agenda is more about reaching out and spreading the necessity for equality, in all formats. In all walks of our society, from both a ground level up and top down.ldquoI feel that we all have a moral responsibility, when it comes to supporting and promoting female, and other, equality here in Northern Ireland. Forwe donrsquot work together, then nothing changes.ldquoMy programmes are embracing, not preaching. They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally. By law, and by society in general.ldquoIt is therefore important to engage and stand up for change now. Otherwise, females will continue to be treated as second class citizens in Northern Ireland, for generations to come.ldquoBoth males and females have so much to give our society.

I do not trust people who are all-things-to-all-men, least of all people who seek high elected office on that basis.There were early warning signs of problems with Mr Blair, not least the way that he projected himself as almost archetypal Tory English, but also in a way Scottish, and then — when he addressed the Dail and talked of Ireland being in his blood — as Irish too.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Not at age  or , but he actually still harboured such ambitions after he left Oxford University.I have a theory that Blair’s undoing is rooted in that specic vanity — the desire to be a rock celebrity. Because he achieved a iation on it in September  , days after the terrorist attacks in America.The then President George W Bush was addressing both houses of Congress in the US, in the fevered aftermath of the atrocities. Tony Blair, who had been the first foreign leader to speak to Mr Bush after the attacks, had flown out to America and was a special guest for the speech.The president turned at one point to the UK prime minister and said that the US needed allies like him.“Thank you, friend,” Mr Bush said.The cameras zoomed in on Mr Blair, who seemed to be suppressing his delight as the parliamentary leaders of America gave him a standing ovation.At that moment, one of the biggest television audiences in America, at a time of national crisis, was cheering the MP for Sedgefield.Think about that.No rock star has ever had a moment like it.Not even the Beatles, who tended to appeal to younger generations, have attracted the adoration of almost an entire superpower.And it was almost asMr Blair, having had the stardom that he had long sought, resolved internally never to put in jeopardy that mass affection.The rest, including his downfall, is history. As it happens I thought he was largely right about that thug Saddam Hussein, evenhe was disastrously wrong in the specics of weapons of mass destruction.I also did not like Blair’s approach to Northern Ireland. While he held firm on important unionist principles in the run-up the Belfast Agreement of , he then initiated an approach to NI politics of appeasement of republicans that has persisted to the present day.But of course he should get a knighthood!Indeed Mr Blair should have been offered it the day he left office.If we are going to be a society that has an honours systems, andthat honours system is going to have a culture known as ‘gong by rank’ , then plainly the head of government should be at the very top of the list.By the way I recall reading many years ago that ‘gong by rank’ would be phased out, and that awards would be based on achievement, not on position. But as far as I can see high court judges still get them automatically.A high court judicial position is one of immense importance and prestige, and such office holders should be worthy of the job and,so, deserving of great respect.But being prime minister is much more important still.It is for that reason that most people can remember and name every prime minister of their letime .Thus even the most short-tenured prime ministers such as Alec Douglas-Home in the s are remembered more than  years later in a way that few other public figures are known.Don’t be fooled by Boris Johnson. For most incumbents, being PM is no fun thing.Indeed perhaps a majority of inhabitants of Downing St in recent decades have emerged as damaged human beings, in some cases almost broken .How absurd that we honour pop stars with knighthoods and people who have achieved great but brief success in, say, athletics but not someone who has been premier of the United Kingdom.What a reflection on our loathing of those who do the vital job of politics.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: You can already see something of a stretch in the evenings——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy said noSinn Fein, its allies and its proxies have played a prominent role in promoting this way of thinking.They claim that unionists have been invited to join a ‘respectful’ conversation aimed at creating an ‘inclusive’ and ‘progressive’ -county republican state. This language is chosen to appeal to people who see themselves as more reasonable, rational and, let’s face it, superior to those of us who have a fixed preference for remaining in the UK.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.But do buzzwords like ‘shared’, ‘respectful’ and ‘inclusive’ really mean anything in the context of Northern Ireland’s proposed destruction  Most of the evidence suggests that they do not and we’ve seen two good examples this week.First, there was the saga of the Queen’s platinum jubilee tree. The DUP MLA, Joanne Bunting, asked for permission to plant this piece of greenery on the Stormont estate, as part of the ‘Green Canopy’ project. This is a royal initiative encouraging people to “plant a tree for the jubilee”, as an environmentally sound way of marking the th anniversary of the Queen taking the throne.Bunting’s proposal should have been uncontroversial but, unfortunately, the finance department has responsibility for the grounds around the Assembly and it is led by Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy. The request to plant a tree was denied. In an attempt to explain, the minister released a statement. “My department’s policy on commemorative structures or planting on the grounds of the Stormont estate is to approve only those requests which commemorate international events.”If nothing , this explanation was consistent, as it is not the first time Sinn Fein has vetoed horticulture it sees as too unionist friendly. Last year Murphy prevented the planting of a rose bush at Stormont to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary. The party may see everything through the greenest tinted spectacles, but it cannot be accused of being overly green-fingered.On Twitter, a former Fianna Fail candidate, Fintan Cox, described its latest decision as “shockingly petty... bordering on sectarian hatred ... a bloody tree!” There was widespread incredulity on social media that Murphy could block such a harmless gesture.Later in the week, though, Sinn Fein was involved in a similar incident and this time it complained about ... a book! The offending volume, ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ by Anthony Leask, was visible behind the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during a Stormont committee video meeting.Maoliosa McHugh, one of Sinn Fein’s burgeoning phalanx of unelected MLAs, interrupted the call to ask the Assembly clerk for an investigation into the permissibility of displaying the publication. ‘Conspicuous Gallantry’ records stories from the men and women of the thBattalion of the UDR.Sinn Fein and others have long tried to demonise this regiment, which suffered horric casualties during the Troubles, portraying the crimes of a few rogue soldiers as systemic ‘collusion’ with loyalist paramilitaries.Allister responded, “Having blocked a centenary stone, a rose bush ... and a tree planted for Her Majesty’s jubilee, republicans now ... try to dictate the contents of my study!” McHugh justied his intervention by claiming, “Workplaces should be neutral spaces.” By this logic, anyone who occasionally works from home should conduct an equality audit of their bedrooms or kitchens, before taking their next Zoom call. The imperative to take offence can call for ingenuity at times. A contemptuous attitude to anything associated with unionism, by people who claim they wish to be respectful, is not confined to Sinn Fein. You hear similar things from nearly all the leading voices in the ious campaigns for a ‘shared’ or ‘new’ Ireland. Indeed, it is almost a prerequisite for anyone who pushes this view in the media, or even just on Twitter or podcasts. The implication is that unionists must shape the  county state while they can, because their place in the United Kingdom and their hopes for Northern Ireland’s future are about to be destroyed. These frequent outbursts actually epitomise neatly the latest wave of nationalist campaigning and it is genuinely useful to have such plain-speaking. It’s a necessary counterpoint to meaningless platitudes about sharing and respect. These campaigners are all smiles and kind words while the ‘conversation’ about Northern Ireland’s constitutional position remains entirely on their terms. When unionists articulate alternative ideas about the future or challenge nationalist assumptions, the smiles soon disappear to reveal ugly and laughably premature Irish nationalist triumphalism.So long as we hear plenty of that and Sinn Fein keep making petty decisions, fewer naive people, at least, will be taken in by empty rhetoric about a ‘new Ireland’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe latest modelling suggests Omicron cases will peak \"towards the second half\" of this month and then decline – probably more quickly than previous Covid waves.Since arriving in the UK at the end of the autumn, Omicron is now the \"dominant\" form of the virus and is \"seeded in all parts of Wales\", the first minister told BBC Radio Wales this morning.More than , new cases of Covid were reported in a single daylast week, and the nations positivity rate – the number of tests thata positive result – is at  per cent, a figure Mr Drakeford called \"really high\".\"The dficult January that we could see coming is I’m afraid with us, and the protections in place are really necessary to help us all get through the challenging weeks ahead,\" he added.There is some optimism the Omicron wave could fizzle out as quickly as it managed to spread here, as it appears to be doing in South Africa, the nation where the iant was discovered in November. And research suggests people are far less likely to fall seriously ill or require hospital treatment with Omicron, compared to the Delta strain.Mr Drakeford urged caution against \"learning too many direct lessons from South Africa\", but accepted thatthe same pattern – of Omicron infections falling as quickly as they rose – were repeated in Wales, then \"we’re in for a very challenging few weeks but that we may come out of the other side of it more quickly than we’ve done in previous waves\".Wales is currently at Alert Level Two, with restrictions mainly aimed at improving safety measures for businesses and public places, rather than closing them down.The first minister said he believed his government had taken \"proportionate measures\" at the right time last month, based on the threat of the Omicron wave. This included closing down nightclubs, but Mr Drakeford said this was a move copied across much of Europe, and clubs were generally accepted to be at a \"particularly acute\" risk of being \"super-spreader events\"..removeBut asked whether his government would have preferred a full lockdown during the current wave, the first minister said this would have been impossible without financial support from the UK Government.Englands approach to Omicron has been less restrictive, as seen on New Years Eve when Newport city centre was a comparative ghost town compared to the crowds in Bristol. Boris Johnsons reluctance to impose further measures in England would make it dficult for any devolved government to win Treasury backing for a lockdown where.Mr Drakeford suggested the playing field was not level, in terms of funding any future restrictions.\"We have had this long-standing argument with the Treasury in London, that when English ministers decide that they need to move up the levels, they know they can draw on Treasury money to do so, and we and Scotland and Northern Ireland are not in that same position,\" he said. \"So we would not be able to move to [Alert] Level Four measures on our own, because level of support you’d need to offer to the Welsh economy in those circumstances is simply beyond what the Welsh Government ourselves are able to mobilise.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

His cross fell kindly to Piroe and the Dutch striker blasted his th goal of the season into the roof of the Saints net.Forster saved Southampton in the final minute by sticking out a foot to deny Piroe, but the giant goalkeeper had no chance four minutes into extra time when Bednarek erted Olivier Ntcham’s effort past him.The lead lasted less than  seconds as Long set up fellow substitute Elyounoussi and the Swansea defence decisively went missing again after  minutes.Ward-Prowse crossed and this time Long was the unmarked beneficiary to seal Southampton’s fth win from their last six visits to Swansea and a place in the last  of the FA Cup..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Southampton overcome early red card to earn FA Cup win at Swansea article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I will try to do my best.“If some fans understand that, they will support the team. That is the main thing, to stay behind the team.“If they don’t understand that some of them, it’s fine, it’s up to them.“But I will continue trying to do my best, be professional and be sure that we can improve what depends on us.”Hull boss Grant McCann was proud of his side’s efforts across  minutes against Premier League opposition..remove“I’m disappointed to lose the game but in terms of the performance I was really pleased,” said the Tigers boss, who was coy when asked about Acun Ilicali’s prospective takeover.“I thought, ‘we’ve gone properly toe to toe with a Premier League team today’.“We pushed right until the end.
