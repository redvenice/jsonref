And of course it was all about the dress.The Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We were speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection.

And when the request to use the atomisers was raised, the response was, well, a little sniffy.The source said: \u0027Apparently Meghan didn\u0027t like the smell of the chapel, which, as you would expect, is a little musty. It\u0027s not unpleasant at all, though. \u0027It just smells how you would expect an old building to smell.

But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one. But if William’s wife has become adept at fading into the background, that does not make her soft.On the contrary. ‘Meghan’s a strong character and so is Kate, so it doesn’t surprise me there have been clashes,’ said the source.Indeed, some are calling her a Steel Marshmallow, a phrase first applied to William and Harry’s great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother.With the days that William, Kate and Harry went around together as a dynamic team now decisively over, they are leading lives that are not only increasingly separate, but very different.Harry and Meghan spent a considerable part of the summer in their rented house in Oxfordshire where they entertained friends including George and Amal Clooney, and tennis star Serena Williams. Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Simon Cowell talks ITV hold Brexit debate no politicians","story":"Simon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate without any politiciansSimon Cowell is in talks with ITV to hold a Brexit debate featuring business leaders and 500 members of the public – but no politicians.A source close to Cowell’s TV production company Syco Entertainment said the audience would be representative of the result of the 2016 referendum.‘Simon wants to see how many change their stance during the debate,’ the insider said.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have agreed in principle to go head-to-head on television next Sunday, but the Prime Minister wants the debate to be aired on the BBC while the Labour leader favours rival ITV.Meanwhile, Cowell, pictured left, has also revealed plans for a celebrity version of The X Factor – similar to the format of the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing – in an effort to revive flagging ratings.

Thankfully however, most of the snow is expected to fall solely on higher ground and in the north. Scotland and northern parts of the UK may also experience freezing temperatures on Sunday when most other places are generally mild.  On Tuesday night rain is expected and this will turn to snow as it falls over higher ground.The Met Office predicts there could be between 10-20cm of snow settling over the highest ground of the Pennines in Yorkshire and around 1.5cm of snow in Snowdonia, north Wales.Meteorologist Sarah Kent said: \u0027We\u0027ll be watching how the weather develops closely and could be issuing some weather warnings later in the week when the picture becomes clearer.\u0027It\u0027s going to be a yo-yo weather week with a bit of everything ranging from frost, showers of rain and cloud.\u0027By the end of this week there\u0027s also the possibility of strong gales in Scotland and the weather will stay unsettled heading towards next weekend.\u0027           People out pre Christmas shopping shelter under umbrellas on Oxford Street in London yesterday during the wet weather    Saturday shoppers shelter from the rain, they may need to wrap up even warmer as snow may be on the horizon          On Saturday a Met Office spokesman said: \u0027It’s still a slightly muddled picture at the moment – but there’s certainly a possibility that, in the north and central England, lower lying areas will also see some snow. It is one to keep an eye on.\u0027Last week several severe weather warnings were issued across the UK, with strong winds and downpours seen across much of Wales, Northern Ireland, western England and Scotland. Storm Diana caused havoc across the UK meaning that flights were delayed and roads were flooded.On Thursday a pylon at Hull KR\u0027s KCOM stadium collapsed onto the pitch due to the intense gusts.In Scotland James and Susan Kenneavy Ford Kuga was found empty on Drummore beach near Stranaer at around 7.30am on Thursday.The couples bodies were found by search teams  washed up on a beach on Saturday morning.          A shopper in canvas shoes jumps over a puddle on Oxford Street in London during the wet weather yesterday afternoonPolice Scotland said the body of a woman was found at the edge of the water in Port William, Newton Stewart, at around 8.15am on Saturday. The body of a man was found nearby around half an hour later. Heavy rain in the area had led to flooding  and the coastguard was drafted in to help with the search.Inspector Craig Nicolson said: \u0027We know the Drummore coastal road was closed last night due to coastal flooding, but I would ask anyone that seen the vehicle or the knows the whereabouts of the couple to contact Police Scotland.\u0027Meanwhile London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway providers said a 50mph speed limit on the tracks on Thursday had left some trains \u0027out of position\u0027 across its network, causing huge backlogs.Motorists faced delays, with widespread reports of trees and debris blocking roads and gale-force winds shutting some bridges.Hundreds of flights serving London airports were cancelled or delayed amid thick fog on Thursday with one in three planes disrupted at Heathrow. London City saw 62 cancellations and 46 delays, while Gatwick experienced no cancellations but 173 delays.The figures were published by aviation data firm FlightStats.Fog reduces visibility for pilots and air traffic controllers, meaning the safe distance between aircraft is increased. This disrupts the normal pattern of take-offs and landings.           A snow covered valley scene near Ruthin, North wales, higher grounded areas should expect these conditions"},{"url":null,"title":"George H W Bushs service dog Sully lying former presidents coffin","story":"Share this articleService dog \u0027Sully HW Bush\u0027 will go on to help wounded soldiers | abc13.com\u0027Mission complete\u0027: Sully the service dog to accompany Bush one last time - CNNPoliticsGeorge H.W.

They betray the causes that they pretend to serve and which they manipulate.\u0027They will be identified and brought to justice for their actions. I will always respect debate and I will always listen to opposition but I will never accept violence\u0027.  The \u0027yellow vest\u0027 or \u0027gilets jaunes\u0027 movement was first prompted by Macron\u0027s move to raise the price of diesel fuel to help the environment.Motorists took to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets which drivers are required to carry in their vehicles in France, giving the movement its name. Since then the protest has gathered momentum and taken aim at the high cost of living and wider dissatisfaction with Macron\u0027s presidency.             A police car burns after clashes between police and protesters, in Marseille, in what has become a national protest movement          Burned cars are seen on Kleber avenue on Sunday morning the day after some of France\u0027s worst rioting in 50 years           Firefighters wearing helmets and protective clothes spray water over a burning car in the centre of Paris amid violent protests          Cars are seen on fire during the \u0027yellow vest\u0027 demonstration on an avenue in Paris last nightThe protests yesterday spread beyond Paris as demonstrators wearing the same high-vis vests blocked a motorway in Biarritz in the south-west of the country and let off yellow smoke grenades in Marseille, France\u0027s second-largest city.The yellow-jacket protests even spread to The Hague, in the Netherlands, where people gathered outside the Dutch parliamentary building on Saturday. The French government has faced difficulties dealing with the protesters as the movement has no real leadership and has not aligned itself with any political organisation.  Macron has sought to douse the anger by promising three months of nationwide talks on turning France into a low-carbon economy without penalising the poor.He also vowed to slow the rate of increase in fuel taxes if international oil prices rise too rapidly but only after a tax hike due in January.On Friday, the government tried - mostly in vain - to talk to representatives of the movement.Eight were invited to meet Prime Minister Edouard Philippe but only two turned up, and one walked out after being told he could not invite TV cameras in to broadcast the encounter live to the nation.The protests have caught Macron off guard just as he was trying to counter a fall in his popularity rating to 30 per cent.His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with ordinary people.            Demonstrators run by a burning fire near the Arc de Triomphe during a fresh protest which has seen Yellow Vest supporters clash with riot police and more than 100 people arrested so far on Saturday           Protesters wearing masks, helmets and the movement\u0027s signature yellow vests wave a Tricolore flag in front of the Arc de Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees     Riot police officers stand in the middle of the damage of La Belle Armee restaurant after the rioting in Paris last night     Smoke can be seen rising in the distance, in a picture taken from the top of the Arc de Triomphe amid the rioting           This picture taken from the top of the Arc de Triomphe shows a scattering of yellow-vested protesters and smoke rising over the Paris skyline as darkness starts to fall on the French capital after a day of violent protest           French riot police are seen locking down a street through the shattered window of the La Belle Armee restaurant which was destroyed in the protests          A vandalised shop is seen on a street the morning after clashes between police and protesters in the city    A man walks away from a burning wreckage as yellow jacket protesters clashed with police throughout the day in Paris          Firefighters rescue two people on the ground who were hurt when part of the Tuileries Gardens was pulled down in Paris           A flaming wreckage in the centre of Paris last night in clashes which led to more than 100 injuries and 400 arrests           French riot police are drenched in spray paint after cans were hurled at them by yellow vest protesters in the capital"},{"url":null,"title":"Adult asylum seeker posed child treated child British authorities","story":"Siavash, the refugee student removed from Stoke High School in Ipswich (pictured by another student on Snapchat) has been confirmed as an adult by the Home Office after they initially accepted he was 15Stoke High School, whose principal is Caroline Wilson, has also been accused of failing  its children with critics saying his true age should have been \u0027spotted from day one\u0027.Desmond Newby, 51, kept his daughters Jamie, 15, and Alicia, 13, out of class while the man was there and said today: \u0027All I wanted in the first place was for him to be removed. I\u0027m ashamed both for the school and the Government for allowing this to happen. They have both failed to protect our children. The teachers should be sacked\u0027.He added: \u0027If the kids knew he\u0027s the age he is, how come the school didn\u0027t know?\u0027How come the school that\u0027s supposed to take care of our children have let this happen? They\u0027re supposed to safeguard them.\u0027The student was suspended earlier this month after a fellow student posted a Snapchat picture of him in uniform in a classroom with the message: \u0027How\u0027s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?\u0027Mr Newby, who lives with his wife Victoria, 32, said Jamie had sat an exam with the alleged asylum seeker.The father said: \u0027We took our kids out of school as soon as it happened.\u0027I went down there and asked them about it. I said you don\u0027t know who he is, what he\u0027s there for.\u0027I said what about the safety of the kids?\u0027 The professional driver from Ipswich, Suffolk added that he was \u0027furious\u0027 that parents had not been kept better informed about the investigation into the alleged asylum seeker\u0027s age.He said: \u0027The school are keeping their mouths shut about it.\u0027If there\u0027s nothing to hide, why don\u0027t they just tell everyone?\u0027The student\u0027s classmates had also discovered what appeared to be old pictures of him on Facebook, showing him with a full beard, a hairy chest and swigging a beer.          The man was suspended from school after classmates started questioning his age and also claimed they found  pictures of him on Facebook swigging a beer in Germany (pictured) with a full beardOne boy even claimed he confessed to being a married father-of-two during a game of football in the playground.The man\u0027s brother was in Year 7 but the Home Office insists he is a child, but he has been moved to a new school.Mr Newby said of the GCSE pupil: \u0027The children are worried because being in that position, he could have been anyone.\u0027If the Home Office is supposed to be checking the immigrants when they come into the country, how come they just turn around and look at someone and say yes, they\u0027re 15 years old?Who cares about Thanksgiving! Shoppers hit the stores to...\u0027The Government must take the gloves off\u0027: Manchester...MI5 and police\u0027s inquiry into themselves finds they made NO...Share this article     The Year 11 pupil who claimed to be aged 15 but looks far older with Facebook posts alleged to show him with a thick beard and sipping beers Pupils became suspicious when they saw that the clean shaven pupil appeared to have the shadow of a beard on his face.They then discovered the Facebook profile in his name which described him as having been an architecture student at the Islamic Azad University in Abadan, Iran, before living in Erfurt, Germany.The pictures on the now deleted profile showed him with a beard and drinking a bottle of beer on a street, and also included an image of the boy who was said to be his younger brother.          Caroline Wilson is the executive principal of Stoke High School – Ormiston Academy, which has 668 students It was also revealed that the pupil allegedly bombarded a 15-year-old girl classmate with text messages, prompting her to complain to safeguarding staff - because she was worried about his true age.But the girl was told that there was nothing \u0027sinister\u0027 about the texts as they were not of a sexual nature. When shown the alleged Facebook picture of the pupil with a beard, the teacher allegedly said that people matured at different ages. She stopped receiving messages from him after she complained.A mother of another pupil said the man had told her son that he was aged 25 and was married with two children when he was asked if he wanted to join in a game of football at break time.Some outraged parents withdrew their children from the school over the scandal, forcing senior staff to remove the asylum seeker from class.Mother and fathers claimed children were potentially being put in danger by the presence of a man posing as a boy.The Home Office has refused to reveal the newly assessed age of the man or any details of his background due to data protection issues. Officials who rubber-stamped his status as a child now face an investigation into how and why they came to that decision amid claims they just took him at \u0027face value\u0027. The school, whose principal is Caroline Wilson, also faces safeguarding questions.   The Home Office is currently investigating how the man\u0027s claim to be aged 15 came to be believed and he is believed to have been moved from the area.A Home Office spokesman said: \u0027We are fully committed to safeguarding children and are looking into the circumstances of this case to understand how it was handled.\u0027Age-disputed cases remain a challenging area of work in which no single assessment technique, or combination of techniques, is likely to determine an inidual\u0027s age with precision.\u0027In the absence of clear and credible documentary evidence, Home Office staff must rely on physical appearance and demeanour to make an initial assessment on whether a person claiming to be a child is under 18.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be under 18, but subsequent concerns about their age are raised - for example by a school - we will act quickly to reconsider the case.\u0027 The spokesman confirmed that asylum seekers claiming to be aged under 18 are believed and treated as children by the Home Office unless they meet one of three criteria.They are only assessed as adults if there is \u0027clear and credible documentary evidence\u0027 that they are, an approved local authority assessment reaches the conclusion or if two immigration officers rule that their \u0027physical appearance or demeanour very strongly suggests they are significantly over 18 years of age\u0027.          The man\u0027s brother was also at Stoke High in Ipswich, but the Home Office say they are sure he is a child. He has been moved to another schoolIn the case of immigration officers making the ruling, at least one of them has to be of Chief Immigration Officer grade or above.The Home Office spokesperson added: \u0027When there is doubt about an inidual\u0027s claim to be a child, the inidual will be referred to a local authority\u0027s social services department for a careful, case law-compliant age assessment and they will be treated as a child until a decision on their age is made.\u0027If an inidual is assessed to be over 18, we will process any asylum claim as being made by an adult. If the application is unsuccessful, and appeal rights are exhausted, removal action will be pursued as appropriate.\u0027In the absence of documentary evidence, Home Office staff are only able to treat a claimant as an adult if their physical appearance and demeanour very strongly suggest that they are significantly over 18 years of age - and where two officers have reached this conclusion independently.\u0027The threshold is set deliberately high so that only those who are very clearly over 18 are assessed as adults.\u0027The man started at Stoke High School which is run by the Ormiston Academies Trust soon after the start of term in September. The pupil was removed from the school earlier this month on the day he was due to sit a mock GCSE maths exam and has not been seen there since. The younger pupil who claimed to be his brother was taken out of school at the same time.The Ormiston Academies Trust confirmed at the time that the pupils were \u0027not attending the school\u0027 and that it had asked the Home Office to investigate the case. The stepfather of a girl in the same class as the pupil said he had gone to the school to complain before the man was removed and had contacted Suffolk Police to make a complaint that a grown man was \u0027posing as a pupil\u0027 in her class.He said: \u0027They logged my call and advised me to go back to the school and demand what action they were going to take.\u0027I ended up speaking to this teacher who said that the Facebook picture of the boy was a case of mistaken identity.\u0027The teacher actually threatened that all the parents who were jumping on the bandwagon could face legal action because complaining about the pupil was a criminal offence. He was basically calling all the parents bullies. \u0027The teacher told me that he had children himself and all the paperwork and been looked at for this person and had been passed by the Home Office. I was absolutely livid and was trying to behave myself.\u0027He was so ignorant and not really listening to what I was saying. I wanted to kick him up the backside and tell him not to be so naïve. My last words to him were, \u0027You have not heard the last about this\u0027. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council denied that it was involved in the age assessment of the pupil and Suffolk Police said they do not believe there is any police investigation into the case. Migrant man who posed as a schoolboy still classed as a child despite stubble and receding hairline"},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice fans clock Sir Alan Sugar wearing SEVEN different Rolexes nine episodes","story":"    Sir Alan Sugar wore a silver Rolex Daytona worth £20,000 on episode one of series 14 of The Apprentice          On episode two, the business tycoon flashed a silver and black Sky-dweller Rolex worth £20,000He also donned an 18 carat yellow gold Yacht-Master II worth £30,000 in episode five where Rick Monk was booted from the show after contestants created their own footwear brand.In one episode Lord Sugar flashed a watch, originally designed for Pan American Airways pilots, worth an impressive £90,000. The Apprentice EXCLUSIVE: Tom admits he felt \u0027relaxed\u0027 going...\u0027A load of Jackson Pollocks!\u0027 Lord Sugar\u0027s barb about the...Share this articleAnd the seven Rolexes worn throughout the latest series are estimated to have cost Lord Sugar around £230,000.Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to point out the tycoon\u0027s varied collection of expensive wrist wear throughout the series.

Michelle Doyle Wildman, acting chief executive of Parentkind, said: \u0027The vast majority of parents are doing a terrific job. I\u0027m not sure berating them will lead to positive change for our kids.\u0027Speaking before presenting Ofsted\u0027s annual report tomorrow, Miss Spielman said health professionals, parents and safeguarding partners should all play a role in raising children. She believes expectations on schools to address obesity, gang-related violence and knife crime risk distracting them from their core purpose.                        More than half of the schools have committed to lowering the mark required to pass the entrance test for pupils eligible for the \u0027pupil premium\u0027 – the Government measure of deprivation. Some agreed to lower the mark by up to ten points.One school pledged to admit all disadvantaged pupils living nearby even if their mark is lower than others – as long as they meet a minimum standard.Many also agreed to help \u0027pupil premium\u0027 children or those at schools in less affluent areas to prepare for entrance tests.It is understood that when the classrooms are built, the DfE will expect each school to set targets for the proportion of disadvantaged pupils they admit.Today\u0027s announcement builds on the 825,000 new school places created since 2010 and the million the Government is on course to create by 2020.Jim Skinner, of the Grammar School Heads Association, said: \u0027The large majority of selective schools prioritise access for disadvantaged pupils, which is backed up by outreach and partnership work with local schools.\u0027Selective schools are therefore well placed to contribute to meeting the ongoing need for more school places and supporting high-quality education provision elsewhere.\u0027The move comes after Theresa May was forced to scrap her plans to create a raft of new grammar schools, targeted at disadvantaged communities.The plan had to be abandoned when she lost her Commons majority because it would have required a change in the law.Following a ban by New Labour in 1998, the creation of new selective schools is illegal. Critics of grammars say only middle-class children can get in because so many parents pay for private tutoring to ensure high marks in entrance exams.But the Prime Minister believes the schools can be a force for social mobility if they adopt admissions procedures which favour poorer pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"Baby Ps monster mother Tracey Connelly allowed contact surviving children","story":"    Tracey Connelly (pictured) has been allowed to write to her surviving children from prisonTracey Connelly has been allowed to write to her surviving children from prison.The disgraced mother watched porn in a drunken haze as her 17-month-old son Peter, known as Baby P, was tortured to death in 2007 by her lover Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen.She has been granted permission to write two letters a year to her other children to \u0027build bridges\u0027 before she hopes to win parole.  Court advisory service CAFCASS is overseeing the contact, with mediators checking the letters before they are sent to the children, reported The Sun.A source told the newspaper: \u0027She watched her own child starve and be brutally attacked, yet now she\u0027s being given another chance to be a mother.\u0027She\u0027s been given a chance to contact her other children.

How did the rapper behind it dream it up?The self-declared “worst alphabet book ever” has become a surprise hit over the last fortnight, with hundreds of thousands of parents rushing to get their hands on P is for Pterodactyl: a picture book that explains to children that while A might be for apple, it’s also for aisle.Dreamed up by Raj Haldar, also known as the rapper Lushlife, with computer programmer Chris Carpenter, P is for Pterodactyl was published by US independent Sourcebooks on 13 November. The first print run of 10,000 copies sold out almost immediately, with the publisher now reporting more than 100,000 unfulfilled orders as they wait for a reprint of another 210,000 copies . Demand has also spiked in the UK sales representative Rob Richardson said that social media buzz after a Facebook post from Imagination Soup saw sales spike from five to 3,000 orders overnight, with an additional and “pretty unprecedented” 10,000 advance orders the next day.“The first day we sold out of the entire first run it’s been quite surreal from there,” said Haldar, whose book is now sitting at No 8 on the New York Times bestseller list. “It’s been totally unexpected.”He and Carpenter came up with the idea after having lunch with a friend whose child had brought some alphabet flash cards with him. “Each one was of a food, so we were looking through them and reading them to our friends’ kid Isaac. We got to Q, and Q was for quinoa,” said Haldar. “We were laughing about how it phonetically sounds weird – plus, I didn’t have quinoa until I was, like, 25. We were joking about that and started talking about how it would be even sillier if an entire alphabet hinged on silent letters.”For a while, they just populated a Google document with words as they thought them up, but “what started to come to light was that the words in this document were implying a really rich universe that would make an awesome kids’ book – gnomes and knights and tsars”. Illustrator Maria Tina Beddia came on board, and they found a publisher in Sourcebooks, where editorial director Kelly Barrales-Saylor called the concept a “completely fresh take” on a standard alphabet book. “Word nerds, like me, love to argue about the complexities of the English language. Silent letters and absurd homophones can be incredibly maddening for all of us, but especially for kids just learning their ABCs or how to read,” she said.Haldar admitted that he and Carpenter had struggled with some letters. “There are plenty of silent-first-letter words, but there are letters where there are very few examples and we had to come up with creative ways to think within the rubric of what we were trying to do,” he said. “For the letter D there is only one word in the English language starting with a silent D. Folks can get the book to figure that out.”Haldar, whose own favourite was “T is for Tsunami”, said he was was glad the book had not underestimated children’s interest. “Kids really do love big unwieldy words – when we point at the cover of the book, even the three or four-year-old just learning to read will be, like: ‘Pterodactyl!’,” he said. “It brings out the word nerd in everybody.”More copies of P is for Pterodactyl are expected to be available in December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adc9c75b4e183f72cd7accc794db75863fbe01b5/0_54_2418_1451/master/2418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c30463544d4b540ab42f0f9df25d35b","title":"qatar pulls out of opec to focus on gas production","story":"Country to leave cartel in January 2019, but will take part in this week’s meetingQatar is to pull out of Opec after nearly 60 years of membership of the oil cartel, but will attend a meeting this week that will discuss cutting output.Saad al-Kaabi, the country’s energy minister, told a news conference: “Qatar has decided to withdraw its membership from Opec effective January 2019 and this decision was communicated to Opec this morning.”He said the decision was not linked to a political and economic boycott of Qatar imposed in June 2017 by Saudi Arabia, Opec’s largest member and its de facto leader, and three other Arab states – the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. They imposed a trade and travel embargo on Qatar over allegations that it supports terrorism.Qatari is one of the cartel’s smallest oil producers, but is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Al-Kaabi said the gulf state had reviewed ways to enhance its role internationally, including focusing on its gas industry. Qatar wants to ramp up liquefied natural gas production from 77m to 110m tonnes a year.He added that Qatar would still attend the Opec meeting in Vienna that starts on Thursday and will set oil policy for next year.Opec members are widely expected to cut production, after seeing oil price tumble this autumn. Brent crude oil prices slid to below $60 a barrel last week while US crude fell below $50 a barrel. Oil prices surged on Monday after the US and China agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war at a weekend meeting of the G20 nations in Argentina.Qatar’s energy minister said the decision to withdraw had not been not easy after 57 years of Opec membership, but noted that the country’s impact on the cartel’s production decisions was small. He stressed that Doha would abide by its global commitments like any other non-Opec oil producer.The withdrawal comes as other non-Opec countries such as Russia have gained more clout alongside Saudi Arabia in setting oil policy.Naeem Aslam, an analyst at online broker ThinkMarkets, said: “Qatar leaving Opec isn’t great news for the oil market and the market participants haven’t digested the full impact of this news. Basically, Qataris have brought the biggest weapon out and it only means more instability between the Qatari and Saudi relationship.“In fact, we would not be surprised if other counties start to follow the same path and then we have no control over supply or demand as each inidual country could just do what they like. Yes, for now, there is optimism that Saudi Arabia and Russia are committed to keep the supply under control. This has jolted the price of oil higher especially the fact that Canada’s largest oil-producing province is curbing the output.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e26d24f125ceab59929198ac28bc10b5c1ee151e/0_526_5662_3398/master/5662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8c47e7a505baf695f615b75a341f1a9","title":"kiruna swedish arctic town had to move reindeer herders in the way","story":"The world’s biggest iron ore mine is about to swallow the Swedish city of Kiruna. The company’s answer? Move the cityThe crack appeared a few years ago, and has been creeping towards the town of Kiruna ever since.“The mines are underneath us,” says Göran Cars. It’s early afternoon but the sun is already setting behind the mountain, colouring the clouds and outlining the town’s most prominent feature: two huge smokestacks. “And you can see the direction of the cracks – coming from the mine, and going straight up to the city centre.”The mine, Kiirunavaara, is the reason this Swedish town of roughly 20,000 people deep in northern Lapland exists at all. It is the world’s largest iron ore mine, and it dominates both economically and visually, the smokestacks sending up twin plumes of black smoke from the denuded mountain like a kind of Arctic Mordor.Over a century, the miners have tunnelled so deep into the earth – 2km at some points – that they have now literally undermined the town. The caverns are causing subsidence, weakening the structure of the buildings, and opening a great crack in the earth itself, which grows wider and several metres closer to the city every year. Kiruna is about to be swallowed by the very mine that gave it life.So, in 2004, a plan was hatched. Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB (LKAB), the gigantic state-owned company that operates the mine, would simply move the city – houses and all.It was Cars who was given the responsibility to plan that new city.“The basic idea here was to have a town square, because the present town doesn’t have a town square,” Cars said last week at the ribbon-cutting for City Hall, the first building in the new Kiruna. A very modern and very gold building designed by the Danish architects Henning Larsen, its most notable feature is that it has an art gallery built into it – the new Konstmuseet i Norr – a rectangular structure that squats inside the atrium like a cube of potato wrapped in smoked salmon.Currently, City Hall sits more or less alone in what feels like the middle of nowhere. In fact the site was the former city dump, and then a succession of factories and junkyards known locally as Death Valley. But if Cars is to be believed, by no later than 1 September 2020 there will be an entire town on this spot.The plans show mixed-use commercial and residential buildings, cinemas, libraries and hotels, radiating in broad avenues from City Hall – and all of it built at the kind of super-dense scale you expect in a capital city, not a sprawling town 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle.The scale of the project is unprecedented. Several dozen buildings will be moved by a specially assembled team of experts who have become so good at their jobs that Cars claims it’s now usually cheaper to move a home than to demolish and rebuild. The huge wooden church will be hoisted and moved other buildings, such as the current city hall and the railway station, will be stripped of aesthetic elements, including lampposts and iron railings, to be incorporated into new structures.And all of it will be paid for by LKAB. It’s not exactly generosity that is motivating the company. “The law is crystal clear,” Cars says. “The mine is required by Swedish national law to compensate for the structural damage it has caused.”It’s also about survival. “Part of Kiruna’s absolute problem is that women have been moving away from the town while men have been staying on,” Cars says. He tells of efforts to attract foreign women to marry mineworkers. “Russians were popular. You had ads: ‘Wealthy miners looking for female company’, he says, adding: “This was some time ago.”The deeper the mine, the more expensive it becomes to remove the iron – and the number of jobs is dropping, too, due to automation. In a globalised age it is increasingly hard to convince young people with university degrees to live deep inside the Arctic Circle.“Our employees live here,” says Johan Mäkitaavola, project manager of LKAB. “I live in Kiruna. I want to have a nice city to live in. I hope my children will stay here or at least come back when they have studied. We need educated people to move to Kiruna and work.”To survive, the city needs to ersify. It is already home to a budding space industry, and in the winter there are direct flights from Tokyo and Shanghai for sightseers eager to glimpse the northern lights. It remains impossible, however, to imagine Kiruna without LKAB, and vice versa.“It’s a big deal,” says Alice Bah Kuhnke, the Swedish minister for culture and democracy, who attended the opening ceremony along with the king of Sweden. “Big. For Swedes, LKAB has almost been part of our DNA – they are so important to the finances of the Swedish state. So for us that’s a really challenging thought, because since it’s such a big deal it’s hard as a politician and as a Swede to really be critical enough.”Part of that means acknowledging an inconvenient truth – the fact that the new town sits on the territory of the Sami, the indigenous people of Lapland, whose reindeer herding is frequently disrupted by mining. The Sami convene their Swedish parliament in Kiruna – though you wouldn’t know it from the opening ceremony.“They just don’t need to give a fuck so they don’t give a fuck,” says Nils Johan Labba with a shrug. A traditional craftsman with an 18-month waiting list for his knives, he is also a member of the Sami parliament. “We have a reindeer community here, this is their moving territory. Or it was – everything changed with the city. Kiruna as a city doesn’t take much consideration about Sami people or Sami lifestyles.”A sense of betrayal is rooted in the Sami experience in Kiruna several Sami told me versions of an apocryphal story about a Sami man discovering a special heavy stone, and being tricked by a Swedish prospector into revealing the location of the iron ore deposits.The company seems exasperated by the issue. “They have their interest in this land and we have ours,” says Mäkitaavola. “So it’s a problem. It’s not easy.”Stefan Sydberg, Kiruna’s deputy mayor, acknowledges the Sami people’s interests must be respected. “But moving the city centre to this area has the least impact, because this is an old industrial area. There haven’t been any reindeer in this area since before the city transformation.“We can’t just sit and say we can’t do anything because we have the reindeer herders. We have to evolve as a city. Because they prosper from that as well.”The impression Kiruna’s officials clearly want to give is of a kind of northern Swedish pragmatism. The city wouldn’t exist without the mine, so it had to be moved yes, of course that is expensive true, it’s Sami territory, but what isn’t? Up here, you simply get the job done.The townspeople are less sanguine. Jan Lindgren is the third-generation owner of Centrum JW Lindgren clothing store (“They always film our sign when they shoot something in Kiruna – the sign and the mountain”) and speaks with a mixture of anxiety and resignation about having to move in 2022. “At first we were negative,” he says. “But we thought it would be very good if they do the right things from the beginning. If they do what they say they will do.”He’ll be renting in the new town, and the shop will be smaller. “There’s a lot of history here,” he says. “But we have planned for 10 or 12 years. We discussed. Would it be the same views? We can see the mountains on a clear day here, but not in the new place. That’s sad.”As well as being less picturesque, the new city centre is colder: flatter, windier and more exposed, though presumably the new buildings will mitigate that barrenness.Mixed feelings abound. “It’s complicated. Even Sami people work in the mine sometimes,” says Grahn. “So it’s not simple to take a stand.”But she says it remains important to show that there is more to Kiruna than the wishes of the company. One of her artworks displayed at the gallery is a bouncy castle, shaped and painted to resemble a mountain. A window beside it has a view of an actual mountain, Luossavaara – a disused mine – as well as tiny mountains of rubble: the first construction sites of the new Kiruna buildings. “I don’t think I need to explain the sadness,” she says, and mentions another mining project – this one in Jokkmokk, in Sami territory south of Kiruna.“I mean, look how right he is,” she says, her eyes wide as she looks out past her inflatable mountain to the actual one. “They’re moving a whole town.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c6a1cd31bdb339c0ad939e4ed687470a259163/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72dbb4c07dc3d526cc37583c3ceed995","title":"their ideas had no place here how crete kicked out golden dawn","story":"Teachers and activists in Heraklion explain how they drove the ultra-nationalist, far-right Greek party from the islandWashing hangs from the balconies of an unassuming apartment block on Irodotou street in Heraklion, the capital of Crete. Outside, children ride bikes and old men play cards in a coffee shop. But before May this year, this building looked rather different. A sign hung outside reading: “Golden Dawn, Heraklion region”. The ultra-nationalist, far-right Greek party used this street as its local base.It was local teachers who first spotted its influence. “Two of my 13-year-old students had family problems,” recalls Maria Oikonomaki, 50. “Golden Dawn approached them in cafes and the gym, presenting themselves as family and protectors. They took them for coffee and gave them lessons on Greek history.”Then came the violence, including the stabbing of two Pakistani workers. “I thought to myself: ‘My god, what is happening in this neighbourhood?’” says Oikonomaki.​Despite the attacks, Golden Dawn might ​have kept its foothold in Heraklion – or ​dug in deeper – had the city’s residents not decided to fight back.Golden Dawn was formed in 1980 and remained a fringe party until Greece’s devastating financial crisis started in 2009. As faith in the major political parties ebbed away, Golden Dawn’s narrative of a once-great nation ruined by immigration struck a chord with some disillusioned voters. As well as becoming the third-largest party in the Greek parliament, it also established a street-based paramilitary wing that regularly attacked immigrants and political opponents.The area it chose in Heraklion was the eastern suburb of Nea Alikarnassos. A working-class neighbourhood, it has a long history of immigration from Asia Minor and eastern Europe. Many residents are employed in construction and lost their jobs during the crisis. Golden Dawn quietly opened its office here in 2011.Crete’s anti-fascist movement initially struggled to fight back. “Our philosophy is that you never let the far right get hold of public space,” says Konstantinos (not his real name), a militant anti-fascist in his early 20s. “In warmer countries like Greece, public space is where the working class spends their lives. Wherever fascists are present, you have to make your presence felt too.”So, when they found out about the new office, Konstantinos and other activists arranged a neighbourhood assembly. “There was a general consensus that people didn’t want Golden Dawn in the area,” he says, “but not enough people came to support the assembly. We realised we couldn’t have a presence in the area all the time. We tried to keep an eye on them, but there wasn’t much we could do.”In September 2012, everything changed. In a crime that shocked the country, the prominent anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas was murdered on Golden Dawn’s orders. Huge protests broke out and 69 members of the party, including its leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, and 18 MPs, were arrested and charged with running a criminal organisation. Their trial is ongoing.“Before this, a lot of people had the attitude of ‘We do not fear Golden Dawn, we just need to educate them’,” says Haris Zafiropoulos, a 27-year-old activist with New Left Current, a coalition of left-wing groups.Activists such as Zafiropoulos embarked on a new strategy: taking to the streets and engaging in face-to-face conversations about fascism and why it needed to be confronted.“Every weekend we went to the neighbourhood and spoke to people,” Zafiropoulos says. “Crete suffered a lot from the Nazis in the second world war, and whole villages were burned down. We tried to remind people what had happened before, and what is happening now.”Meanwhile, across Crete, teachers rallied to address the radicalisation taking place in schools. “The way the fascists moved within the pupil community was so clever and so sneaky, we did not realise what was going on at first,” says Fotis Bichakis, founder of the Cretan League of Anti-Fascist Teachers. “It was easy for young students who were feeling frustrated to become manipulated.”The teachers worked together to prepare lesson plans that taught history in a less nationalist way and explained and confronted fascist ideologies. The following spring, 56 schools collaborated on an anti-fascist festival.The teachers chose not to view already-recruited students as lost causes. “We always had faith they could come back to democratic ideals,” adds Bichakis. “As they saw more of their peers joining in with anti-fascism, they began to question whether they had been misled.”Oikonomaki says she believes the strategy stopped any more of her pupils being radicalised. “We had students from Albania, Romania, Bulgaria,” she says. “I’d tell pupils: ‘Golden Dawn says other people are inferior to Greeks. Do you really think that about your friend John you sit next to every day?’”Militant activists also made the controversial decision to confront the group violently. In April 2018, Konstantinos and around 70 other anti-fascists organised a night attack on the Heraklion office. “We destroyed everything of value – the floors, the ceilings, the AC unit,” he says. “We think that was the final straw for them.”Indeed, Golden Dawn packed up and left two weeks later.Not everyone in the community is happy about the violence. “It’s important we don’t come across as two sides of the same coin,” says Zafiropoulos.Konstantinos, however, is unrepentant. “It worked!” he says. “We may not be able to stop Golden Dawn becoming celebrities in the media, but we can stop them spreading their roots within Greek society. Crete is the first major region of Greece to have no Golden Dawn presence … We have effectively stopped them from having any space to reproduce.”Elsewhere in Greece, the far right appears to be on the rise again. The country’s dispute with Macedonia over its name has led to swell of nationalism, and there have been violent attacks on politicians and asylum-seekers. Halikiopoulou believes anti-fascist activism of the type used in Crete can work “on a local level. But opposition cannot and should not be confined to the anti-fascist left. We need something on a more organised, mainstream level.”Oikonomaki is wary of saying the battle is fully over. “We could easily communicate who Golden Dawn were and why they were bad,” she says. “But the crisis is not over, and people still want to put the blame on someone.

These are the real milestones to aim forPoor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I mean that literally, by the way, as it appears the 29-year-old US politician is embarrassingly impecunious. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, reportedly has less than $7,000 (£5,500) in savings. Shocking, right? Obviously I am aware that poor people exist, but I had no idea they were allowed to become politicians.CNBC appears to have been similarly appalled – it recently devoted an article to the sorry state of Ocasio-Cortez’s savings. It is true, it noted, that research shows the median amount millennials have saved is $2,430 (£1,900), but “while Ocasio-Cortez’s situation is normal, it’s not ideal”. According to several financial experts that CNBC consulted, Ocasio-Cortez should have around $27,000 (£21,100) saved for retirement. (A calculation based on the popular benchmark that you should have a year’s worth of salary saved by the age of 30.)Now, as you may have noticed, a fail-safe way to rile millennials, who are poorer than previous generations, is to lecture them on money it being somewhat difficult to squirrel away savings when wages are stagnant, house prices are bonkers and student debt has soared. CNBC’s tone-deaf analysis of Ocasio-Cortez’s finances was not well received on the internet. Indeed, it was promptly given the meme treatment, with people tweeting their own advice about important things one ought to have achieved by age 30. Like deciding on “a favourite spoon”, for example. Or developing “a maniacal laugh at the mention of ‘trickle down’”.The meme got me thinking. You see, back when I was young and delusional, I was under the impression that, by the time I was as ancient as 30, I would be very rich (in an ethical way, obviously) and incredibly successful. I would have won a couple of Nobel prizes. I would have thought to myself, “oops, I’ve got a lot of money” and live in a house, a very big house, in the country. Long story short, I am 35 now and have won zero Nobel prizes, and do not live in a very big house in the country. I do not even have a favourite spoon. While my situation is normal, it’s not ideal.But I am not here to complain I am here to reveal the actual milestones one ought to have achieved by the age of 30. The milestones the mainstream media dare not talk about. Let’s start at the beginning of the alphabet, shall we? With adult-onset allergies. You see, I don’t mean to boast, but in my late 20s I developed a brand new allergy to trees and now sneeze more than I ever thought possible. As it turns out, my immune system is at the forefront of an emerging trend: various reports suggest adult-onset allergies are becoming increasingly common. So, if your body hasn’t turned against you by the time you reach 30, I’d get a little worried. Why are you still so chummy with pollen? Why is it still pleasurable to breathe? There’s clearly something wrong with you.Next, I want to talk about receipts. One of the non-negotiable markers of being a proper adult is being terrified to throw away receipts just in case you need them in the future for Serious Finance Things. At this point I was going to move onto the fascinating subject of chin hair, but I’m afraid I will have to skip to the end. Once one is over the age of 30, it is important you are able to stick to the strict word count you have been given and not finish articles abrup …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc47b519b6bea52b6d806dc27b7933b44d2f68ce/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d84d10cf908ebf81b85a21125ffb032","title":"honest brexit bigotry ugly chapter history","story":"Today, I shall go to the German embassy in London to sign the necessary forms so that my half-German sons may apply for dual citizenship. My father and one of my brothers have already been granted Maltese passports (my family hails from the tiny Mediterranean island). I am glad that such options are available, as a Brexit of unknowable character approaches, and at a time when the prime minister sees fit to label those of us with funny continental names “queue-jumpers”. It is fair to say that, in the circumstances, we are fortunate.Yet I think it is time to be a bit more honest and plain-speaking about those circumstances. For the most part, the debate about Brexit since the 2016 referendum has been framed primarily in economic terms. The leavers have spoken excitedly about the free-trade bonanza that supposedly lies the other side of 29 March. Remainers point out that Britain is cutting itself off from the largest single market in the world.But this to-and-fro is a polite fiction draped over a much uglier reality, and one that has little to do with GDP. I keep hearing that it is rude and counterproductive to suggest that xenophobia played a significant part in the 2016 result, and it is certainly true that such accusations should never be made lightly.All the same: there are moments when politeness is not always the highest priority, and reticence more closely resembles cowardice than civility. As Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry reminds us: a man’s got to know his limitations – and I’m afraid I’ve reached mine. I’m done with the whole pretence that the argument about Brexit is, and has always been, a subtle jurisprudential discussion about sovereignty, or an exciting debate about the business plan for UK plc.Look at the evidence. In June 2017, a report collated from the British Social Attitudes survey showed that the most significant factor in the leave vote was anxiety about the number of people coming to the UK. A comprehensive study published by Nuffield College in April drew similar conclusions about the salience of immigration in attitudes to Brexit. “Take back control” was indeed the slogan of the leave campaign, but it was “control” with one purpose, above all others, at its heart.Which is why Theresa May was so uncompromising last week when urged by cabinet colleagues that it was not too late to reconsider the impact of tighter immigration policy on British companies. An end to free movement, the prime minister informed them, was a non-negotiable feature of the deal that she will first put to the Commons on 4 December.It is for this reason, too, that she is uninterested in the thoughtful proposal by the Conservative backbencher Nick Boles that she should contemplate a Norway-style interim arrangement with the EU, if MPs reject her agreement with Brussels. The Norwegian model preserves freedom of movement, which, for May, is the most garish of red lines.I think something profound, unsettling but still underexplored, underpins this scale of priorities: a fundamental change that needs to be understood outside the day-to-day disasters of this useless government and even of the Brexit process itself.For decades there was something close to a political consensus that the most important metric was economic prosperity. A wealthy nation was essential both to the aspirations of inidual households and the funding of public services. The Tories might give greater weight to the former, Labour to the latter. Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown had radically different visions of social justice and collective responsibility, of the relationship between taxation and public spending. But they were as one in their conviction that nothing much was possible without a strong economy.Brexit is both symptom and cause of a breakdown in this consensus. It can no longer be taken for granted that senior politicians, or the voters themselves, will automatically and reflexively put national wealth first.As long ago as January 2014, Nigel Farage was explicit about this: “If you said to me, would I like to see over the next 10 years a further 5 million people come into Britain and if that happened we’d all be slightly richer, I’d say, I’d rather we weren’t slightly richer.”Of course, such statistics are now routinely dismissed as the latest iteration of “project fear”. But the more intriguing (and alarming) point is that so many senior figures in the political class responded with such comparative calm to these appalling prognoses. We have reached the point where, to an extraordinary extent, the implementation of the 2016 referendum result trumps all else.Why so? Because, as Farage declared with more candour than most mainstream politicians can yet muster, culture is nudging old-fashioned political economy out of its prime spot. Immigration is now the gravitational centre of the whole debate: a debate much less about national wealth or national sovereignty than national identity.Beneath all the talk of “control” and “global Britain”, there is the germ of an extremely unpleasant nativism. Again, we pesky centrists are told to be quiet and to heed the concerns of those who have been “left behind”. But since there is not a shred of respectable evidence that immigration has had more than a marginal impact upon public service capacity, wage levels or net welfare costs, I am forced to conclude that there is now a sufficiency of Britons who just don’t much like people of foreign extraction, and certainly don’t want many more of them around the place.So often one hears that the British people “were not consulted” about immigration levels. To which the answer is: oh yes you damn well were. Every time you insisted on a properly staffed NHS, on social care that was halfway decent, on a service economy that worked, on affordable decorators, on your Tesco and Amazon deliveries arriving on time. Each time you took that landscape for granted, you were complicit in the immigration policy that preceded the Brexit vote.We live in a world defined by the economic, social and cultural interdependence of nation states. And those who promise that leaving the EU will deliver “control” are really promising something quite specific: a social and cultural reboot. As well as being morally contemptible, of course, this is also a complete impossibility. But those who pose as our leaders have allowed this absurd and horrible vision of Britain’s future to take root. Let us be honest about what this is all about. And then let those who are responsible take full ownership of whatever consequences lie ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d80f67a1e74bb0777bbc90222f02aca470241d2/0_26_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=885252a9404a5627b717bb09b64b35cc","title":"the guardian view on parliaments brexit debate time to choose","story":"The televised debate that Britain needs is not a joust between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn but the one that actually begins in the House of Commons on Tuesday. This will be the most consequential parliamentary event for a generation, and perhaps since Britain joined the old European community in 1973. British politics have been building up to this since the 2016 referendum and ever since parliament insisted on having a “meaningful” vote on the deal. Now we are on the eve of that. The voting at the end of this five-day debate on 11 December will decide whether, and if so on what terms, Britain departs from the European Union or whether, perhaps, the issue will be returned to the voters for another referendum and for a possible democratic reversal of Brexit.The question that faces MPs is whether the EU withdrawal agreement and the declaration on the future framework of relations, both of which were signed off by the EU and the UK last month, are an acceptable basis for Brexit to go ahead. In this newspaper’s view they are not.  opposed and opposes withdrawal. The declaration, in particular, is simply too vague a prospectus for relations with the EU to be an acceptable basis for Brexit. It does nothing to protect the economy through commitments to remain in the single market and customs union. It offers no guarantee that jobs, interests and regulatory regimes are protected from the fanatics and fantasists who want to drive wages and standards down and turn our backs on Europe.The events of the next week will be increasingly fast-moving. The precise political options and effects of the votes on 11 December will be difficult to judge until the day itself. At the outset, however, there seem currently to be four main options: no deal at all, Mrs May’s deal, a softer form of Brexit deal, and a second referendum. Of these, two are clearly ruled out. No pro-European and no social justice supporter should countenance the multiple risks and damage of no deal under any circumstances, while Mrs May’s deal is, as stated above, too full of dangerous holes.The two options that deserve more thought by MPs are a softer deal and a second referendum. The choice will depend, in part, on how the domestic Brexit endgame evolves over the next week. The way the Commons votes on Tuesday to sequence the different amendments to the May deal will have significant consequences. Given the vital importance of Britain’s relations with Europe, and the existence of the 2016 vote to leave, it is important that this hung parliament comes together across party lines as much as it can.The most viable form of softer Brexit on offer now would have Britain leaving the EU on the basis of Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement. But it would also specify that, at the end of the planned withdrawal transition, the UK would rejoin the European Free Trade Association (of which Norway is the most important current member) and join the European Economic Area and the single market. In addition, under this “Norway plus” option, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU. Economic integration and freedom of movement would continue, largely on EU terms, but Britain would have left the EU. This would draw the sting of the Northern Ireland border argument. It would leave Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade largely redundant.A second referendum has growing support outside parliament and backing within it. It is the only route open to MPs to keep the UK in the EU. Yet that outcome is not certain. Leave could win again. Either way it is a daunting prospect. It would deepen bitter national arguments still further. It would demand a far better and more reasoned pro-European campaign. But we can see more starkly now what Brexit would actually mean. If MPs do not support the May deal or the Norway-plus option, there are clear circumstances in which a second referendum becomes the only supportable alternative to no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fcad0746ab49ea696d9a31e74057df93297dd51/0_213_5050_3029/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d69cd689e301cb1cb9ed50adb61000f","title":"dont be alarmed there are many ways of getting out of bed","story":"I had to overcome my addiction to the snooze button – luckily, there’s an app for thatThe day I decided to ruin my life started just like any other.

Happily, a few writers are doing soI recently met a young author who was writing a book of non-fiction about a Cornish fishing community. It’s a timely subject, as fishermen’s long-felt antipathy towards the European Union was a key driver in Cornwall voting for Brexit, even though the county has received millions of pounds in funding from Brussels since being awarded Objective One status in 1999. It’s a timeless subject, too, exploring a way of life that has endured for centuries. The writer, who grew up in London, spoke thoughtfully about coming to a place as an outsider and trying to put people’s voices on the page in a way that doesn’t amount to appropriation. Based on our conversation, and the extract I’ve read, I think it could be an important book.A book about a Cornish fishing community is good news because the county is an oddly overlooked place and we need writers to tell the truth about it. Everybody knows that Cornwall boasts a dramatic coastline and beautiful beaches. Thanks to the Tate gallery, many people know artists have been drawn to my hometown of St Ives for more than a century. The area has nurtured great poets, too, with Peter Redgrove and WS Graham living and writing there in the second half of the 20th century. But Cornwall doesn’t figure much in prose, or at least not in a way that amounts to a contemporary literature.There are recent novels set in Cornwall, but they tend to be about a romanticised past (Poldark casts a long shadow) or sell a fantasy of the place to tourists, making life there sound quaint and trivial. The fantasy is damaging because, behind the veneer of Seasalt clothing and Doom Bar ale, the reality couldn’t be more different: not only is Cornwall the most remote county in England, in terms of geography and transport links, but it is also one of its poorest, with a high suicide rate to boot.To explore these conditions imaginatively, Cornwall needs a literature of its own. What do I mean? Well, first let’s acknowledge the exceptions that show you needn’t grow up in a place to write authentically about it. Patrick Gale’s novel A Perfectly Good Man (2012) captures the texture of everyday life in the county, while Helen Dunmore’s description of DH Lawrence walking up the hill my dad lives on in St Ives, in her novel Zennor in Darkness (1993), makes my spine tingle. More than anyone, Graham, who came from Scotland and would have turned 100 last week, wrote about the landscape and people of west Cornwall with such vision and intensity that he brought them to life for me.We push for ersity in the arts because we recognise that people need to see themselves in films, novels, plays, art galleries. They also need to see their places. Graham, Gale and Dunmore show me my places, but they cannot do so with the eye of somebody who has been shaped by them.At my school, there was a ide between the Cornish and non-Cornish. It was arbitrated by those for whom having three generations in the local graveyard was the minimum criteria for being Cornish. This made me miserable, because it felt like the height of parochialism, but I recognise it now as defensiveness from people who saw their local culture being eroded by the decline of traditional industry, its replacement with tourism and the rise of second-home ownership. Still, when I describe a literature of our own, I’m not advocating excluding anyone, but instead envisaging the kind of specificity that makes stories universal. As the poet Tom Leonard writes: “The local is the internationalthe national is the parochial.”Cornwall is a county, not a country, but the Cornish should take inspiration from their Celtic counterparts, in particular the staggering number of excellent writers in Ireland today. Sally Rooney, whose second novel Normal People has just been named Waterstones’ Book of the Year, follows Lisa McInerney, Donal Ryan and many others whose voices were forged amid the wreckage of Ireland’s economic crash. For decades now, Scottish writers such as James Kelman, Janice Galloway and Alan Warner have shown that their communities can be the scenes and subjects of great art. Kelman captures the rhythms of speech in his native Glasgow, and McInerney gives us the details of life on a housing estate in Cork, in ways that testify to the unique power of fiction about a place written by its own people. “My culture and my language have the right to exist,” said Kelman after winning the Booker prize in 1994. He added that what he had said would “apply to Liverpudlians and the Cornish”. A quarter of a century later, some are evidently determined it will. This year, Natasha Carthew, a self-described “working-class country writer from Cornwall”, published her first novel for adults, All Rivers Run Free. Next month, Faber will publish Kingdomland, the debut collection by the Cornish poet Rachael Allen.But why does it still fall largely to outsiders to write about the subjects that have been under my nose for years? I have always felt something of what Australians used to call a “cultural cringe” about coming from Cornwall. Perhaps one of the effects of growing up in a deprived and remote place is lacking the confidence to write about it, whereas others seem better equipped to tackle what they find there. It’s one thing identifying your cringe, another overcoming it. But of this I’m confident: at a moment when Britain feels fragmented in complicated ways, indigenous writing can help people celebrate their distinctiveness at the same time as fulfilling literature’s great mission: that we all understand each other a little better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4920acc5c4c37cc9d641a79f07baf06e345c49df/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a49e5dda2eb2913e3f3bef1a46834ea9 700w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of wait","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘wait’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘wait’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what wait means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 5 December at 10am.

Germany’s Allianz and Italy’s Generali limited underwriting this year, while French firm Axa tightened its policy further.A third of the global reinsurance market has also restricted cover for coal, with the reinsurance firms Swiss Re and Munich Re limiting their underwriting this year.UK insurers, though, have made less progress than European firms. Lloyd’s of London, the world’s oldest insurance market, has done nothing to encourage its syndicates to stop insuring coal or sell their coal investments, the report said, although it excluded coal from the investment strategy for its own central fund in April.Lloyd’s said: “The Lloyd’s market is made up of more than 50 insurance companies that run almost 100 syndicates between them. These insurance companies each have their own investment policies. It is not the corporation’s role to set investment strategy for the market, although we think that by showing leadership in this area, others in the Lloyd’s market and wider insurance sector will be encouraged to follow.”Aviva and Legal \u0026amp General are focused on engaging with coal companies to create change, and only sell their coal holdings in exceptional circumstances. Neither provides insurance to coal companies, but Aviva is one of the top investors in the Polish coal industry, whose plans to build more than 7 gigawatts of new coal power are inconsistent with the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, according to Unfriend Coal.Unfriend Coal’s campaign coordinator, Lucie Pinson, said trying to engage with coal companies was “a waste of time” and that cutting financial ties with them was the only way forward.Across the Atlantic, none of the nine leading US insurers have taken any action. In Japan, there are the first signs of change, as three large life insurers – Nippon Life, Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda Life – have announced they will no longer fund new coal projects.Globally, Allianz is the only company that has pledged to cut its financial ties with coal companies completely by 2040, by stopping both underwriting and insuring in coal. The Unfriend Coal report is being presented to insurers at an insurance and climate risk conference in London, and as the UN climate change conference gets under way in Poland on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2474f13c7ee12003d4e833fcdbced8b6a4b3e631/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2f9e27f1881038d1449770916987fe3","title":"christmas movies home alone love actually creepy","story":"From Macaulay Culkin’s violent traps in Home Alone to Tim Allen’s harrowing body horror in The Santa Clause, festive classics are often surprisingly unsettlingThe most recent episode of Honest Trailers dealt with the beloved Christmas movie Elf. And, while it struggled to land any decent hits on what has now become an immovable piece of beloved festive furniture, it did make a good point about the film’s central romantic relationship. Because, after all, Elf is the film where Zooey Deschanel falls in love with what is basically a toddler trapped inside an adult body. Viewed from that perspective, Elf is creepy as heck.But then again, aren’t all Christmas movies fundamentally creepy? Here, with the barest minimum effort, I will expose some of your favourite Christmas movies for the monstrous nightmares they actually are.Where to begin? There’s the bit where Liam Neeson tries to get over his dead wife by vicariously encouraging his son to violate several important post-911 airport security laws purely in the vain hope that a stranger will kiss him. There’s Hugh Grant’s prime minister, who abuses his status to pursue a romantic relationship with an employee. And, of course, there’s Andrew Lincoln the man who orders his friend’s wives to be completely silent while he wordlessly recounts his sickest fantasies to them. It’s actually incredibly easy to imagine Louis CK playing every single male role written for Love, Actually.The film that contains Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas, which is less of a song and more of an unconvincing attempt to distract yourself from the unrelenting horrors of the world with tinsel. It fools nobody. Also, some of this film is set at Halloween, and Halloween is spooky.In which a boy’s dead father is dragged back to Earth from the afterlife, taking the guise of a wisecracking, sentient, genital-obsessed snowman in a doomed bid to win back the affection of his grieving son. But as soon as the plan succeeds, the sun comes out and the man dies all over again, trapped in a never-ending hellcycle of death after death after death. Merry Christmas everyone! Your dead parents will never find the peace they’ve always longed for.A tale of parental neglect, the effects of which manifest themselves in the sort of extreme dissociative violence that usually lands people in secure facilities. You sense that, straight after the credits ended, Macaulay Culkin went out into his garden to pull the legs off some kittens. Plus, if Old Man Marley isn’t a serial killer I’ll eat my hat.Here’s something nobody ever mentions when they talk about A Muppet Christmas Carol: why is Michael Caine the only human in the world? What happened to all the other humans? Did the Muppets kill them all? Is Caine their slave? Is he simply biding his time before he attacks the Muppets and inevitably wins, thanks to his giant size, massive teeth and comparative resistance to fire? This film is all of my nightmares come to life.Not exactly a creepy story per se, but you try spending a couple of hours watching Tom Hanks’ cold lifeless eyes float around unmoored on a succession of smooth, squidgy, objectively evil motion capture creations. It’s like watching the scene from Alien Resurrection where all the half-formed mutant Ripleys beg for death, but with more choo-choo trains. Monstrous.Ostensibly, this is a Santa Claus origin film. However, when that thin gruel of a plot runs out of steam after about 10 seconds, we’re treated to a second act where Dudley Moore’s elf becomes ravaged by long-gestating daddy issues and attempts to force Santa into a miserable wilderness of irrelevance. This film is Shakespearean in its cruelty.Incredibly The Santa Clause – in which a man harrowingly transforms into Santa against every last one of his wishes – was not an early David Cronenberg body horror film. Wonders will never cease.Where successful businessman Nicolas Cage is sent to a parallel dimension to be learn the wholesome values of family life. You know who comes out worst here? Those poor children who suddenly have to have Nicolas Cage for a dad. Merry Christmas kids! Unwrap your present! It’s a dinosaur skull that your dad can’t really afford!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c7d44c70b83355807b9a01feb3e9a4396b2b522/0_112_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d82c30e3529346f54a883f2da5f48275","title":"jordan pickford apologises mistake liverpool winner","story":"Jordan Pickford apologised to Everton fans for the “freak incident” that gifted Liverpool victory in the 96th minute of the Merseyside derby and sent Jürgen Klopp sprinting across the Anfield pitch in celebration.Klopp said he apologised to Marco Silva for his wild reaction to Divock Origi’s dramatic winner – a claim denied by the Everton manager – after the England goalkeeper turned Virgil van Dijk’s miscued volley back into play via his crossbar and on to the Belgium international’s head to score. A close-fought derby had seemed destined for a draw until Pickford’s error allowed Liverpool to return to two points behind leaders Manchester City.Everton’s goalkeeper was devastated but insisted he would react positively. “I think it is the Everton luck when we come to Anfield,” said Pickford. “It was a freak one, really. It had hit the bar twice and I tried to flick it over. The ball spun and as I tried to flick it over, my hand hit the bar. It’s unfortunate but I am strong mentally.“I just want to say sorry to the Everton fans. I think you could see our progression as a group, the chances we created and the football we played. That’s a positive but what can I do? There is always a case as a goalkeeper if you make an error it will lead to a goal. Unfortunately, it has been me today but I will be ready for Newcastle on Wednesday. We know we held our own against a good Liverpool side for 96 minutes. I will say sorry to the Everton fans again because I know how much it means to them. As players, we know how much it means to us. You make mistakes every now and again. It’s not something you can learn and train and get better from. It’s just a freak incident.”Liverpool’s manager sprinted across the pitch to embrace Alisson after his free-kick to Trent Alexander-Arnold led to the winning goal. “Immediately after the game I apologised to Marco Silva when we spoke to each other,” said Klopp. “I told him how much I respect his work, because it’s incredible what he has done with that team. They are a really outstanding side.“Derbies are always difficult games but this was completely different to the last few years. What can I say about it? I didn’t want to run. It was not in my plan. I didn’t want to run to Ali, I couldn’t stop obviously. Not cool, but it happened. The more important things happened during the 95 minutes. Again, all my respect for Everton, really good. Both teams delivered a proper fight, a proper derby from the first second.”But Silva, who described Liverpool as “lucky, lucky, lucky”, rejected Klopp’s claim about the apology. “He didn’t apologise to me,” said the Everton manager. “To be honest I didn’t see it, I don’t know what he did. I don’t think he expected anything like that either. It was a lucky way to win but that’s football. I don’t say it was a lack of respect because I didn’t see it. Maybe when I see that moment I can say more about the situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/908b7c5af67b5a69a03987f6716d2ae1f0773e85/556_238_3107_1865/master/3107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a95affa86a8765ae997452e60cb1414","title":"manchester city arsenal womens super league match report","story":"• Manchester City 2-0 Arsenal• Stanway’s double ends unbeaten start to Gunners’ seasonA Georgia Stanway double and a tactical masterclass from Nick Cushing, who said Manchester City now have a “fighter’s chance” at the title, led the home side to become the first team to take points off an injury-hit Arsenal and closed the gap at the top of the Women’s Super League to three points.“In this isolated period nine points is very difficult, six would have still been a challenge, three and we’ve given ourselves a fighter’s chance,” the City manager said. “But it doesn’t mean anything. I remember eating my Christmas dinner last year and we were top of the league unbeaten, won every game, Continental Cup final, FA Cup semi-final, Champions League quarter-final and by the end of the season we took nothing.”Arsenal struggled to assert themselves with the same swagger they have elsewhere this season. With their midfield architects Kim Little and Jordan Nobbs out with a fractured tibia and ruptured ACL respectively, Joe Montemurro was forced to drop Danielle van de Donk much deeper and hand a full debut to the 17-year-old Paige Bailey-Gayle.“I’ll never make excuses for the injuries that’s the squad I put out, that’s the squad that represented Arsenal,” said Montemurro. “We couldn’t break them down and every time we got the opportunity to pull the trigger we didn’t.“We lacked that quality in front of goal. They were camped on their 18-yard line and the midfield line was dropping off. We couldn’t find any space.”The warning signs were there early on. England’s Under-20 World Cup bronze medalist Stanway raced through the middle in the sixth minute but Leah Williamson recovered enough to put her off and her tame shot went into the arms of Pauline Peyraud-Magnin. With Tessa Wullaert and Jill Scott combining neatly on the right for City’s brightest play, it felt as if the breakthrough would come from there. Instead a testing Demi Stokes cross from a rare break on the right landed at the feet of Stanway who fired City in front from point-blank range.With 15 minutes of the half left the Gunners began to claw their way into the game. The league’s top scorer, Viv Miedema, who was playing deeper and deeper, won the ball on the edge of the City box and slipped in Beth Mead, Arsenal’s brightest outlet. She twisted past two blue shirts before laying off to Katie McCabe, who rattled the crossbar from a tight angle.Shortly afterwards Mead cut inside and shot from 30 yards, forcing Ellie Roebuck to tip the ball over the bar. With Arsenal chasing the game and the City captain, Steph Houghton, and Jen Beattie nullifying the threat of Miedema, who has scored or assisted 14 goals in her last six games, Arsenal got scrappy. Miedema tried her luck on the left, evading two challenges before handing over to Mead, who shot from an acute angle. Roebuck pushed the ball into the air before catching it ahead of the incoming Van de Donk.In terms of the outcome it was as close as Arsenal got. A wonderful ball from Keira Walsh sent Stanway away on a solo run on the right she cut inside and beat two defenders before slotting into the bottom corner to trigger rapturous celebrations in the stands and on the pitch.A first win of the season for Everton, against Liverpool, kickstarted Willie Kirk’s tenure on Merseyside. Inessa Kaagman’s 30-yard shot gave the home side a sixth-minute lead before Jess Clarke equalised. However, Simone Magill sealed Everton’s win before the break.Birmingham kept pace with Manchester City and Arsenal as goals from Lucy Staniforth and Charlie Wellings saw off Yeovil, despite Emily Syme’s late reply. West Ham leapfrogged Bristol City with a 1-0 win at Brighton thanks to a Jane Ross header. While Chelsea climbed to fourth with a 1-0 win at home to Reading."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

Increasing stress levels, coupled with a greater focus on physical health and wellbeing, are cited as factors in the growth of both, as well as celebrity endorsements – Madonna and Geri Halliwell have long sworn allegiance to yoga, while Beyoncé and Emma Stone fly the flag for pilates.But despite the longevity and global popularity, confusion persists about yoga and pilates, compounded by the increasing variety of classes offered in each discipline. Ashtanga, iyengar and vinyasa are all considered relatively modern incarnations of yoga inevitably new variants of pilates have sprung up, too, as the market has become more commercialised. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, whose mother, Doria Ragland, is a yoga teacher, is a fan of Megaformer – a souped-up version of reformer pilates – while gyrotonic yoga is credited with helping Andy Murray with his longstanding back issues.Teachers of both yoga and pilates say they are routinely asked to explain the difference between them. “The simple answer is that they’re both low intensity, low impact and inclusive, unlike many other forms of exercise,” says Prof Greg Whyte, a former Olympian and now leading authority on sports science. “Generally speaking, yoga is much more about flexibility and stability, pilates is strength and stability.”But, for every flashy gym offering yoga classes to burn calories and sculpt bodies, there are many more teachers committed to its traditional spiritual principles. Yoga was originally practised by holy ascetics in India, its aim to focus the mind, connect with a higher consciousness and, through this newfound compassion, end suffering in the world.For Lily Silverton, a fashion editor turned yoga teacher, it is a way of life that demands she practise social value. “I strongly believe that in yoga, you’re in service,” she says, giving as an example her voluntary work with mental-health and refugee charities, homeless people and children with special needs.Jonelle Lewis, this month’s Om Yoga magazine cover star, describes teaching yoga as a form of stewardship. “These are not my teachings,” she says. “These are lineage teachings that we have the honour to pass on to people.”Although pilates is not a spiritual pursuit, its origins are rooted in healing and rehabilitation. Its German inventor, Joseph Pilates, relocated to England in 1912 and, as war broke out, was interned with other Germans working in a hospital on the Isle of Man. It was here that he invented the beginnings of his reformer, cadillac and chair equipment, using springs to help bed-bound patients develop their muscles.That tradition continues to this day. Laura Browning Grant, a pilates teacher in North Carolina, gained a huge following on social media for using pilates techniques to rehabilitate her husband, Jonny, a former Navy Seal who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car crash. Grant has written about the power of pilates for both physical and mental wellbeing.“I have worked with iniduals that have experienced trauma, causing emotional and physical damage,” she writes. “Using the pilates method, many were able to regain a sense of balance in their life.”Suzi Power teaches yoga and pilates at the community studio East of Eden in London, and sees the benefits of both. She advocates pilates as a safer option for those prone to injury, or those who are exploring this type of exercise for the first time. “I trained in yoga first, but I was drawn to pilates reformer because I had a yoga injury. Pilates helped me to rehabilitate.”Yoga uses the body to connect with the mind and the inner self, while pilates uses mindfulness to connect to the inner workings of the body. “I practise both and love both – I think they complement each other well,” says Lottie Murphy, a former ballet dancer, now pilates teacher. “The main difference is the focus on the spiritual element in yoga. Some of the actual poses are similar – in pilates, we do the elephant, which is basically downward dog, and also backbends. It’s just that in pilates, we tend to build up to some of those moves more slowly than you might in yoga.”Interestingly, the NHS does not count either practise towards its recommended target of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week (although it does count towards muscle strengthening), but the more dynamic forms of yoga do offer a cardiovascular workout. “I’d love to get someone from the NHS down to a dynamic flow class, or rocket yoga, where you come out dripping with sweat,” says Ruth Tongue, a pilates teacher of 10 years and yoga fan.Be warned, however, the more dynamic forms are not recommended for beginners. “They move very quickly, so there’s potential for damage to joints,” says Silverton. “Both pilates and yoga target muscle groups that you won’t access in many other forms of exercise. You can be an incredibly fit runner or boxer and come out of a yoga or pilates class in agony because you’ve worked muscles you don’t usually engage.”As the skinny, immaculate white women who pop up in a Google image search go to show, the stereotype is that yoga is squarely aimed at those with privilege. Lewis, a rare woman of colour in the industry’s spotlight, is understandably frustrated that the practice’s roots in Indian spirituality have been all but erased from its public image.“Yoga is for everyone,” she says. “I don’t know a single person who wouldn’t benefit from being able to breathe more deeply, have more mental space and put ease into their body. But you look in the media, or go into a yoga studio – even in London – and it’s all vanilla.”Tongue, whose clients include Charlton women’s football team, is equally frustrated by the Instagram imagery of pilates. “I don’t teach any classes where people turn up in crop tops. I mainly teach older people, often in their 70s. They’re really strong and they love it.”When professional athletes come to Whyte asking about yoga and pilates, which discipline does he recommend? “Often I suggest a combination of the two. Pilates has become the mainstay of rehab, particularly for back problems. But it’s also great for other conditions, such as urinary incontinence. You’re focusing on the core, whereas yoga tends to be more the whole body.“Both are great in pregnancy, although the key advice to remember is that pregnant women should look to maintain fitness, not improve it. Maintenance of range of motion is fine overstretching is problematic.”If you are hypermobile – that’s when joints stretch further than they should – the consensus is to try pilates first, and to approach yoga with caution. “You can do yoga and be hypermobile,” says Silverton, who is hypermobile herself “You just have to be very careful. Let your teacher know, don’t push to your maximum, and keep a microbend in the knees and elbows when you practise.”Ultimately, it might just be down to personal preference. Power says the choice is as much in the mind as the body. “People who are more logical tend to like pilates, creative people tend to like yoga. My partner is an accountant and he can’t stand yoga – it’s too hippy for him – but he likes pilates.“People with a creative brain often find more freedom in yoga.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b179478b83aa98dbd8dcdcca4de56c22fd98e28/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1818f22bb860bf6055a600a0abf5e49","title":"seven ways to keep exercising in the cold dark winter months","story":"Whether it is undertaking the NHS Couch to 5K plan or signing up to a marathon, having a goal can give shape and structure to an exercise routine. Whatever your motivation and fitness level, there are numerous events (many of them free) that you can enter.Some people love exercising on their own, but for others, it is helpful to have company. Buddy up with a friend or get involved with a local group or class. Parkrun, which organises free 5km timed runs in more than 500 locations across the world, is a great way to meet people in your local area and is easy to join. There is another incentive to working out with pals, too, according to Dr Joe Costello, senior lecturer in exercise physiology at the University of Portsmouth. “Research suggests that if people are meeting up with friends to exercise they are less likely to pull out.”“There’s no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing,” said the late British fellwalker, illustrator and guidebook author, Alfred Wainwright. Base layers, gloves, headbands and hats are all useful for extra warmth. If you are going to and from a place for exercise, wrap up in a coat or jacket so as not to get chilly while travelling. Visibility is also something worth paying attention to if you are exercising outside in the dark.If the thought of working out at home brings to mind grainy images of lycra clad aerobics instructors, it is time to rethink your strategy. From free online tutorials, videos and podcasts to subscription-based services such as Zwift (used by some professional cyclists as part of their training programmes) the options are plentiful. Walcott recommends using indoor training to complement outdoor training. “If you’re training for an outdoor race, for example a 5k or 10k, then you should be doing strength training as well.” The NHS’ Strength and Flex plan is designed to be equipment-free and easy to follow.There are numerous apps and gadgets that can help keep track of your activities. And it doesn’t need to be tech heavy. Making a note or placing a dot on a calendar or chart can help you visualise how much you have already done. If counting steps is your thing, be aware that just racking up the numbers is not enough. Earlier this year, health experts encouraged people to increase the intensity of their walking, rather than just focusing on distance. Public Health England’s Active 10 app combines walking intensity and time. Not having enough time was cited as the main reason why people struggled to fit in exercise, according to a recent survey by PHE, so a 10 minute brisk walk each day is among its recommendations.Rest and recovery are important, especially if you are undertaking intense exercise or building up your fitness. According to Michigan State University, athletes who are sleep deprived may experience subtle changes in hormone levels, leading to higher levels of cortisol and a decrease in human growth hormone, which is active during tissue repair. Be it a hot drink or a warm bath to soothe your cold bones, having a reward to look forward to can be key on cold, miserable days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b4680f876cc35f1eeb41b2169c65d956e3d6f7/0_0_4864_2918/master/4864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baa15860ffb0c750c8a9fd6290d3b3ef","title":"car hire booking ryanair timing","story":"We added the rental when booking but it was only available the morning after we landedI think your readers should be aware of a problem on the Ryanair website. If you add a hire car to your booking there’s the danger that you’ll arrive at your destination only to find the car hire firm shut. I recently booked a Ryanair flight to Grenoble in France and, as it was convenient, I added car hire. The Ryanair website did all the work – took the same dates from the flight and added it to the car hire booking, and I paid the total requested. But when I landed, the rental car place was closed. It wasn’t until I scrutinised the paperwork that it emerged that my car hire didn’t start until 8am the next morning. I was very fortunate to talk my way on to a shuttle bus, otherwise I would have been sitting outside an airport all night.Nowhere in the reservation process was it obvious that the car date did not line up with the arrival of the flight. When I complained, Ryanair said it was nothing to do with them. I disagree. By acting as my agent to promote and reserve the car, it has represented this product as part of its offering. I suggested that it adds a pop-up warning of the date discrepancy but this has been dismissed. You might want to warn others that this is going on. MG, by emailBut when we made a dummy reservation this week, the Ryanair site did precisely that – it automatically put in the car hire dates and created a pick-up time 30 minutes after the flight was due to land. Colleagues in the office checked with their existing Ryanair bookings, and found that the airline does, indeed, populate the car hire pick-up time, so we are baffled by its response.It looks as though with this case, the Ryanair system automatically defaulted you to the next day as the car firm had closed by the time your flight arrived.Ryanair refuses to back down, saying it is your responsibility to check. It says: “We have reviewed this case with our car hire provider, CarTrawler, and while we can understand the frustration, this customer completed this booking with the pick-up date and time clearly displayed,” it says.We thought Ryanair was being a bit tough here but it later told us that customers adding a car hire during the booking flow will now be presented with a warning message if the opening times do not match their flight arrival time.The moral of the tale is to be wary about using Ryanair’s car hire booking system as a timings might not match your flight unless you thoroughly check all the details. Or, better still, book your car hire independently, meaning you are in charge of the reservation process from start to finish.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Read about the top 20 below, and hear the whole top 100 in playlists on Spotify and Apple Music. We’ll be counting down the albums of the year throughout the rest of the month, with No 1 announced on 21 December.There are only two bands in this top 20, showing how the cultural dial (at least among  critics) has continued to drift away from indie and rock. But this Melbourne quintet show that jangling guitars will never, ever stop being a joy, no matter how much tastes change. Mainland has a scrappy garage chug, tempered with the sweet breeziness of chillwave indie like Real Estate, and vocal harmonies that cock an ear to Teenage Fanclub – plus bags and bags of melody.One of Drake’s three transatlantic No 1s in 2018, In My Feelings was given an extra fillip by the viral dance craze created by Insta-comedian Shiggy, but its success was sealed by the sheer harmony of the track itself. Drake balances a beautifully simple, keening top line with the chaotic big dick energy of late rapper Magnolia Shorty, whose sampled exhortations to “clap that ass” were duly followed on dancefloors across the globe.There’s no greater crime in Kacey Musgraves’ world than a big head. She got cosmic on her fourth album, Golden Hour, yet her effortlessly pop songwriting remained grounded. The villain in High Horse is a buzz-killer who thinks they’re cooler than everybody else – too cool to get down with her sumptuous string flourishes, the kind of Bee Gees razzle-dazzle that begs for a synchronised dance routine and a chorus that, astonishingly, lands the phrase “giddy up” with aplomb. More fool them.Malamente is about defying a bad omen, but even if you can’t understand a word of Spanish star Rosalía’s lyrics – thrillingly rapped, trilled and whispered – the song’s dangerous air of seduction makes her proposition perfectly clear. She brought electronic minimalism to flamenco and coupled it with a ravishing aesthetic more complete than that of many cinematic auteurs: a star was born.The sort of filter-house edit that rolls into clubland with pleasing regularity, the German producer delivers a masterpiece of condensed emotion by mashing up a two-bar loop of Melba Moore’s Pick Me Up I’ll Dance with vocal samples from Gladys Knight’s Neither One of Us. The sound of an Ibizan sunset.Yes, Boys’ sassy chimes and vintage funk licks bring to mind Blurred Lines and Uptown Funk. But this screamingly delightful ode to Lizzo’s voracious sexual appetite (encompassing “big boys, itty-bitty boys, Mississippi boys, inner-city boys” and more besides) is no mannered pastiche, and rights the coercive wrongs of Robin Thicke and Pharrell’s infamous single by insisting on pleasure for all involved.Quite early in My My My!, Troye Sivan appears to give up on writing proper lyrics and decides to succumb to sensation: “Oh, my, my, my!” he exclaims, over and over and over again. This is exactly as a song about sex in a new relationship should be: as his coy, sultry verses give way to irrepressible pop euphoria in the chorus, he preserves the awe in ecstasy.Could he become the new Giggs? The east London rapper certainly shares his deep-throated authority on this breakthrough track that threw down a marker like a banger on a pavement. This is UK drill at its most glamorous, high-definition and addictive, Unknown T conveying the claustrophobia of crime-ridden streets even as he delivers withering disparagement of his foes the sheer resonance of his voice makes the chorus incredibly catchy, linked by a bridge of pure bashment power. It quite simply slaps, and is a reminder that MC culture in the UK remains thrillingly vital and innovative.Héloïse Letissier has made a career of living out her multifaceted desires, but Doesn’t Matter confronts the consequences of self-denial: denying treacherous thoughts while lying opposite a lover, denying eating disorders, denying the sense that you want more than you’re supposed to. Deny yourself long enough, and existence and escape become inconsequential. It is a desperately sad song: bass lurching like an oil spill that tapers to a calligraphic point, a stark Hey Mickey drumbeat that’s almost mockingly peppy. A shimmer of light finally offers a reprieve, tempering Letissier’s desolation with hope.An utterly exquisite nu-disco pearl, as suitable for dancing around a penthouse in a cocktail dress as a e bar in a sweaty T-shirt. Muffled deep house organ chords are topped by chiming bells, with a little ribbon of acid wriggling between them Gou’s own Korean vocals are a beautiful combination of naivety, boredom and earnestness.The millennial We Didn’t Start the Fire or Sign O’ the Times, Love It if We Made It is an assault for our intolerable times, delivered by Matty Healy with a numbed intensity that mimics today’s information barrage. But two beautiful, intangible ideas defeat all the concrete headlines he cites about Trump, Kanye and weaponised mistrust: faith and empathy. “I’d love it if we made it,” Healy sings, in one of the year’s simplest yet most affecting lyrics.Hip-hop’s relationship to material wealth can be so jaded that relentless invocations of “ice” and brands become just another production texture. There’s sometimes beauty in this, but beauty too in a newcomer appraising their potential spoils like Violet Beauregarde walking into the chocolate factory. The best line in this year’s song of the summer is: “I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks,” conveying Cardi’s novel purchasing power and sending up some frankly silly shoes in the process. It’s a perfect come-up track: its salsa, trap and boogaloo sound paying tribute to Cardi’s roots while she tries on her new life for size and relishes the fit.You feel for Robyn: what has she lived through to so adeptly transmute pain into song this consistently and effectively? The true successor to her defining hit Dancing on My Own, Missing U encapsulates the horror of a breakup: not the immediate ugly-crying aftermath, but the horrible period where the other person remains a part of you, like a phantom limb you can’t hold. By making it danceable, meanwhile, she hands you a tequila shot, pointing a route out of pain through hedonism.In which the Norwich duo crush assumptions about young women as “objects of disdain” and “drama queens” to be patronised with this total beast of a song (and with it, preconceptions about their more whimsical, earlier incarnation). Peppered with “glitter-eaters”, “ponies in the sky” and flashy industrial clatter courtesy of producers Sophie and Faris Badwan, it plays out like a video game set in a neon dystopia. Crushing the patriarchy: 100 points.After the 18 months she’s had – the Manchester bombing, the death of a beloved ex and the end of a brief, high-profile engagement – nobody would have blamed Ariana Grande for disappearing somewhere hot and secluded. Instead, she once again seized tragedy by the collar and made something beautiful. Thank U, Next’s sing-song delivery and featherweight R\u0026ampB production shared DNA with many a pop kiss-off, but disguised heavyweight sentiment: benevolence to her exes, but more importantly, herself.Full of the whipcrack claps, voluptuous bass and Muzak tinkle of 80s boogie, this was saved from being a nostalgia exercise by the sheer sexual charisma of Héloïse Letissier. Her delivery in the verses is provocative, prodding you in the ribs on the chorus, she seems to shrug and let you come to her. These are all means of seduction, one way or another, as she tries on the macho energy of a cocksure guy – and wears it well.The jury was out on the  music desk as to whether this song was about emotional nourishment or cunnilingus. Well, perhaps it can be both: how sex can be spiritually restorative, or self-care its own kind of eroticism. Sensuality is certainly invoked by the production, which is techno at its most ambient and pulsating: the bass a warm throb, the kick drum like a velvet-gloved finger tapping a glass table.The witty genius of this song, Grande’s first release following the horror of the Manchester arena attack, is that it enacts its tale of moving on through the music itself. It begins as a quailing power ballad before shaking that mood off in favour of a sassy pop strut, showing that the only way out from rock bottom is up. By making statements such as this and Thank U, Next part of her public grapple with trauma, Grande is crafting her own bracingly resilient narrative.The arch-android who could explain every element of her immaculate pop on her previous albums professed to be lost for words on Make Me Feel, her brain scrambled by lust. It was a relief to hear: Monáe’s output had always always impressive, but sometimes felt hamstrung by her rigid adherence to poise and concept. But here she was, grasping to define her state of mind (“powerful with a little bit of tender  an emotional sexual bender”) and revealing the carnal side beneath her glorious hardware. Still, even as she yelped and gasped through her sexual awakening, the music – taut funk buoyed by a synth line later revealed to be a gift from Prince – maintained Monáe’s essential organisational architecture.And music video of the century while we’re at it. Donald Glover’s track was an immediate sensation thanks to its accompanying visual, but even shorn of its video, the track is still so rich with meaning.The switch from a sunny, Chance the Rapper-style Daisy Age song to a stern trap track suggests Glover is asking black Americans to snap out of it and, per his other most famous song, Redbone, stay woke. The central message is to remember that this is America, where someone got shot by police who mistook his smartphone for a gun: “This a celly  that’s a tool.” Or could the phone be a tool you use yourself, perhaps to document police brutality (as in the video)? The double meanings start to stack up.By rapping “I’m on Gucci  I’m so pretty”, he’s perhaps saying that black America is distracting itself from these horrors with consumerism, and even glossy trap music itself. But paired with the heavily ironic minstrel poses he makes in the video, he could also be saying that these are the roles that black people are pushed into in a still-racist culture.Indeed, a central lyric is “get your money, black man”, and so Glover is on one level leveraging the current wild popularity of rap, letting his audience know he is getting paid: given the track’s No 1 success, it was a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, then, is Glover telling us to be pragmatic, to play by the rules? The sheer invention and daring of the song and video seem to contradict that.Round and round we go. In the end, it’s a glorious reminder that, in an age of monomaniacal political discourse, art can be about two things at once, and then some.• Tracks by Black Midi, Eris Drew and Pusha T featured in our top 100 but didn’t feature on all streaming services, and so have been replaced on the top 100 playlists with the next most popular tracks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

Tea and plain biscuits were served – and the mood was serious to the point of being almost sombre. Particularly so, initially, because discussion focused on a disturbing report on poverty in the UK by the UN’s rapporteur Philip Alston. The shadow secretary of state for work and pensions, Margaret Greenwood, made a presentation, and for over an hour members of the Labour top team expressed dismay at the legacy of Tory austerity on the poorest in society.But those present were anxious and earnest for another reason. They knew Labour had to decide what to do next about Brexit. The fact that Theresa May’s deal with the EU was looking more likely, by the day, to be defeated in the House of Commons on 11 December was not just a looming catastrophe for the prime minister. It also required, urgently, a clearer strategy from Labour.What would Her Majesty’s official opposition, split like the Tories over Brexit and ultra-cautious in every move until now, do amid the chaos that would inevitably follow defeat for the prime minister?With less than half an hour left before the meeting had to end, because MPs had to go to vote, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, opened a discussion that could well, one day, feature in the history books. According to several sources who were there, Starmer made clear that if and when May lost the “meaningful” vote, Labour had to be ready, as he put it, to “move quickly through the gears”. What he meant was twofold, said those in attendance. First he was clear that Labour should waste no time in calling a no-confidence vote in the government, which if passed could lead to a general election. Several shadow cabinet ministers agreed that this should happen within 24 hours.But, given that few at the top of Labour (Jeremy Corbyn, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Starmer included) believe such a no-confidence motion has much realistic chance of succeeding – as Labour does not have the numbers – Starmer’s reference to moving “through the gears” meant that further moves had to be prepared.“What was clear and implicit from what he said,” said a shadow cabinet member, “was that if and when we fail with a no-confidence motion, we must be ready very quickly to take up the option of a second referendum, if that is the best route to take. The danger for us of not doing that could be that we would have no policy at all.”Up until last Wednesday, Labour had taken refuge in the convenient, if slightly implausible, argument that it could bring down the government by forcing an election, and then somehow renegotiate a better deal for the country once in power. That tactical line served a split party well, keeping enough people on both sides of its Brexit ide tolerably content.But with the vote fast approaching and a TV debate between Corbyn and May pencilled in for next Sunday, it could hold only for so long. Starmer and others could see that if Labour failed to force an election, and with the EU adamant that it will not renegotiate in any substantial way, the opposition looked like running out of policy options.Several senior figures at the meeting strongly backed Starmer, including Tom Watson, the deputy leader, Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, and Richard Corbett, leader of Labour MEPs in the European parliament, who all specifically said the party should prepare for the option of a second referendum. Those at the meeting said it was clear that Remain would have to be on the ballot paper.Crucially, several shadow cabinet ministers confirmed that Corbyn offered no real objection to the proposal, although the Labour leader stressed the need to move step by step, with the first task being to ensure that the prime minister’s deal was voted down. Watson was particularly strong on the need for clarity. McDonnell too appeared to have come round to the idea, saying in a BBC interview the same day that it now looked “inevitable” that Labour would back a second referendum.Only two shadow cabinet members – the campaign coordinator Ian Lavery and shadow lord chancellor, Richard Burgon – are said to have spoken out against, warning that pro-Brexit Labour voters would never forgive them. Lavery said, according to one source: “If we support a second referendum we will never get the keys to Downing Street.” Those who agreed were, though, in the minority.Labour’s progress towards backing a second referendum has been slow and difficult. But pressure has been building, not least because the mass membership supports one. For Corbyn, a lifelong Eurosceptic, it has clearly been painful. Only two weeks ago he was saying the party had to honour the result of the 2016 referendum, meaning no second vote.And the party is not there yet. Another referendum would have to be officially endorsed by the shadow cabinet, and possibly the parliamentary Labour party. Even then, legislation would have to pass through the Commons and then decisions about the question to be put determined by MPs and finalised by the Electoral Commission. Tory MPs would have to come out in favour, as some Labour Eurosceptics such as Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer would oppose it.We are some way off yet. But there is a clear movement. On Friday Sam Gyimah resigned as universities minister, saying a second referendum should be considered. With parliament increasingly deadlocked and Labour moving “through the gears”, it is starting to look like there may be no other viable option.

Aboriginal groups are ided into subgroups, called “skins.” Your skin is determined at birth, based on your parents’ skins, and it does not change in your lifetime. Your skin will determine certain social rules, such as who you marry.The Warlpiri, who live northwest of Alice Springs, ide themselves into eight skins, according to the rules in the diagram below. Yes, it’s complicated! The skins are numbered 1 to 8. The horizontal rows indicate marriage correspondences, while the arrows point from mother to child. (All the marriages here are between men and women, and we can assume no orces or half-siblings or step children.).So, if your skin is 1, you must marry someone with a skin of 5, and vice versa, since both these skins are on the same horizontal line. If your skin is 2, you must marry a 6, and vice versa.Similarly, if you are a female with skin 1, your children will be skin 4. If you are a female with skin 4, your children will be skin 2, and so on, following the arrows around.For skin 1, males are Jakamarra, and females are Nakamarra. Likewise, the names of the other skins always begin with a J for men, and the J is replaced with an N for the women. (Except Jupurrula, which becomes Napurrula.) I’m not making any of this up, by the way.Now imagine you go into a Warlpiri village and speak to six people about their family relations. Based on these responses, can you determine the female name for each of the skins? “I am a Nampijinpa. My mother’s grandfathers were Jungarrayi and Jupurrula.”“I am a Napanangka. Some of my good friends are Napaljarri and Nangala and Nungarrayi. Oh, you wanted me to talk about my family? Oops.”“I am a Japanangka. My wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife’s father’s mother’s brother’s wife was Napurrula. I know my family tree very well.”Even if you can’t do today’s puzzle – and it is quite tricky – at least you have learnt about Aboriginal kinship groups!For mathematicians, extra points if you can tell me which dihedral group describes the relationship structure of the Warlpiri.I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the answers.Today’s puzzle was devised by Alan Chang, a maths PhD student at the University of Chicago, and appeared in the 2013 North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad. Alan got the idea when he did a class on Aboriginal languages while studying at the University of Melbourne.(Hints are fine, as is a discussion of the ideas behind the puzzle and related issues, but please don’t write the answer.)I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.Christmas gift alert! In need of a present for a 7 to 13-year-old?

In the last few years, Big Issue sellers have been proactive and they’ve gone off and purchased their own payment devices, but we hope this pilot is the starting point that will provide more vendors with an income in the changing landscape.”If the trial goes smoothly, it will be rolled out nationally, although it will not be simple. To have a card reader, a vendor must have a bank account, which requires a fixed address. As a result, the pilot has been limited to 20 sellers and, if it is to be expanded, Big Issue will have to work with vendors and banks to help them open accounts.One of those participating in the trial, Paul Logan, 59, who sells the magazine in Bristol, said people often told him they were not carrying cash, although it was sometimes difficult to tell whether they were just making an excuse.“People comment: ‘Don’t you have a method where I can pay by card, that would be easier and more people would be able to buy it,’” he said. “It can only help if they see that I can offer them an option. I think it most definitely should increase the money I get. I’ll just have to shout out: ‘We take debit cards and credit cards.’”Another trial participant, Easton Christian, 64, who sells the magazine at White City, London, said he had “definitely noticed a dip in the number of people carrying cash, which has had a knock-on effect on the number of magazines that I’m able to sell”.Other social enterprises and charities have also been exploring ways to ensure they do not miss out as a result of the dash away from cash.Earlier this year, Greater Change was launched in Oxford, which allowed passersby to donate to homeless people via an app by scanning a barcode worn around the inidual’s neck. In the Netherlands, the Helpless Heart contactless jacket trial last year allowed passersby to donate by tapping a card on the chest of the homeless person’s coat.In the US, the newspaper Street Scene launched an app last year to enable homeless vendors to take cashless payments, and collect the money from the offices at the end of the day. In Sweden, Situation Sthlm, also a newspaper sold by homeless people, has teamed up with the same card reader company – iZettle - as the Big Issue.Tap London ran a pilot scheme earlier this year that allowed homeless vendors carrying contactless card readers to raise money for homeless charities, while being paid the living wage, by selling cards designed by local artists.On Wednesday, the social enterprise launched an initiative, backed by Sadiq Khan, allowing people to donate £3 at contactless points around the capital to help tackle homelessness, which has already had more than 1,000 taps.Katie Whitlock, co-founder of Tap London, said: “People really want to give and we’re not carrying much change anymore, and it’s having a detrimental effect on people and charities, and that’s beyond homelessness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e96976ed1b109bd7a299ec3b77d4cf4ea9625bb/0_141_4608_2764/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9870d065f0a9bde9e017a99fea60afdb","title":"teenage boys and young men tell us what issues matter to you","story":"We want to hear from young men living in the UK for a project exploring the issues most important to youWhat’s it like for teenage boys and young men growing up in the UK?

They were reduced to 14 men after 24 minutes when Kyle Eastmond was sent off for a high tackle on Ian Madigan but England’s most successful and best supported club now have the worst defensive record in the league, having shipped 292 points, and are in eighth place, only three points off the foot of the table.“We were not good enough and have to take it on the chin,” said Spencer. “We did not show up as a team or do the things we had worked on in training. We have to look at ourselves and get better, a million times better. We have got world-class players and coaches who put everything out for us and prepare us really well. We have not shown up enough this season and in this league that means you get beaten. We have to be better and we will.”The former Leicester hooker Harry Thacker scored Bristol’s first try inside two minutes and added a second before half-time as Bristol chalked up their second biggest Premiership win to move above the Tigers in the table. “It was a good result but we still have a long way to go,” said Thacker.“We are still building but we put in a performance we can be proud of. What was pleasing was that, when they had a player sent off, we did not go off script and put ourselves under pressure. We kept our composure and made sure we finished off the game.

It is one of four deep space exploration missions planned by China’s National Space Administration, with an asteroid probe expected in 2022 and a mission to the Jupiter system set for 2029.In the first Arab mission to another planet, the UAE Space Agency’s Hope spacecraft is to launch in July 2020. The probe, which will study the Martian atmosphere, should land in early 2021, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the founding of the UAE.With high hopes for humanity’s future on Mars, Elon Musk’s space exploration company is developing a fully reusable space-launch system, set for its first cargo mission in 2022. A crewed mission is intended to follow in 2024, creating a base from which Musk hopes to develop a thriving city and, eventually, a self-sustaining civilisation.

From Christmas cocktail parties to sit-down dinners, here’s how to host with impact and ease this seasonThe nights have drawn in, George and Mariah are in a state of perpetual soundclash, and with them comes the unsettling urge to host a seasonal get-together.If you’re an unsteady host, even an intimate dinner with a handful of friends can seem daunting, so when you chuck in the plus-ones, her next door and a cluster of colleagues, that “fun and festive” party can start to feel anything but.But things don’t need to get all out of control and Abigail’s Party. We live in a time when fine dining and Michelin-starred chefs appear in the most casual of settings, and that informality extends to the at-home-host, too. Claude Bosi - head chef of Bibendum restaurant and Rémy Martin cognac bar – is one such Michelin-starred chef who advocates this relaxed approach when entertaining.“The key to a great party,” he says, “is to ensure you are with your guests. There are so many dinner parties where you try to impress and find yourself spending more time in the kitchen than you spend with your guests. A great party is a balance between good food and good hospitality.”Here’s how it’s done:The dinner partyThis casual mantra starts at the top – the formalities of the past have been dispensed with. Invites can go out on WhatsApp or email. Similarly, boy-girl seating plans at dinner are a relic of another time. Remember, too, if there are only two single guests at a dinner party, they don’t necessarily want to be seated together, lest they feel like show ponies being watched over by the other guests for signs of good chemistry. And unless you have a particular gift for crafting, there’s no need for place names.That said, some small details done nicely can make a real difference. Take your dinner table, for example, as chef and caterer Stephanie Boote says: “I like a simple table, not too much fuss. A linen cloth can be lovely, napkins, if you have them. A couple of little vases or bottles with flowers or foliage. Candlelight is a must. You can have a pile of plates and cutlery on top of an undressed table, a water jug and a stack of glasses, and if you have candles lit it will all be just fine!”There are lots of ways to make life easier as you prep your dinner-party meal, especially as your guests arrive and the heat rises in the kitchen. For Bosi, a neat trick is to go for a cold starter. He suggests getting a terrine from a local deli and serving it with a salad, all handily ready to go on plates ahead of time.Food writer and author Killian Fox offers similar logic when feeding a crowd. “Simplify,” he says. “Instead of a starter, lay out a range of snacks – decent crisps and dips, olives, maybe some crostini – for people to eat when they come through the door. Use the time you’ve saved to make sure everyone has enough booze.”Drinks are, of course, key to a great dinner party. Leave time at the beginning for an aperitif, which will give you more breathing room to prepare your food, take account of inevitable late arrivals (“our Uber kept cancelling”) and let appetites build.Fox suggests a handy seasonal cocktail, too, named London Calling. “It was apparently devised at Milk \u0026amp Honey in Soho. It’s citrussy, it contains sherry, and it gives you a chance to look classy with a cocktail shaker. A fine Christmas drink.”Bosi suggests a drink can offer some surprises and lead to unexpected food pairings. He likes a Royal Sidecar, made with Rémy Martin 1738 Accord Royal cognac, Cointreau and lemon – and paired with oysters.“Until recently, cognac was something you would have after a great lunch,” he says. “It’s not something you’re expecting to drink at the start of the meal, but I find it goes very well with seafood. It’s a nice surprise, a bit of creativity. At that moment, you’ve made people really relaxed and given your meal a stamp of quality.”From then on, you can go with some classic dishes: a big joint of meat, a casserole that can be easily cooked in advance, a beautiful stew with game, or Bosi’s festive favourite: beef wellington.When it comes to serving, Bosi tends to stick to sharing plates. “I put pots in the middle of the table and we start sharing,” he says. “I think dinner parties with people closer to each other are a better atmosphere.”Boote adds a word of practical advice: “Preparation is key. Your guests are here to see you, not have you run about trying to do things. Keep it simple, with excellent ingredients that speak for themselves.”Dinner party music has long been something of a slur, a byword for a pleasant but bland background soundtrack. But you don’t want to be sitting in silence accompanied only by the sound of mastication and scraping forks, so head to Spotify to put together some playlists.For dinner, you want something that is eclectic but not too distracting – you don’t want to be continually flicking to the next song. However, you also don’t want to drift into nondescript tastefulness, either.The drinks partyInteresting people, nice snacks, some decent tunes and plenty of booze is all that’s needed for a drinks party. Keep things loose – this means submitting to the inevitable and assuming a crowd will congregate in your kitchen. Be ready to push some seats away in the living room if a late dance party emerges.When it comes to the drinks, try to be creative, says Boote: “This year, we have made a fig leaf syrup to go with lime juice, gin and soda. It’s delicious without the gin, too.” She follows that adding clementine flavours and fizz to spirits makes any drink feel “festive and delicious”.Of course, guests will be looking for something to nibble on, so lay out some decent crisps, popcorn or olives.You can also add some more expansive finger food into the mix. Boote goes for gougères, a French choux pastry filled with cheese, while Bosi will be serving up some intriguing offerings: Rémy Martin cognac, mixed with tonic (a Rémy Grand Tonic – the French spin on the British classic), served with his “pickled cockle popcorn”. The cockles are rolled in flour then deep-fried in hot oil, coming out as if popcorn. “It’s a fantastic pairing,” he says. To give it a seasonal twist, add some clove or orange to the cognac.Fox offers a snack serving with a backstory: “The Gilda – a pintxo created in honour of Rita Hayworth, who starred in the film Gilda. It’s pretty easy: skewer a couple of green olives on a toothpick with guindilla peppers and an anchovy fillet.”You want to keep the music equally eclectic but a little more upbeat. However, don’t feel the need to overload it with bangers and floor fillers. If the party goes late, you can bring out the hits. Remember to let a few people try out their music selections – it’s never fun to be overprotective of the music at a party, nor do you want one person hogging the speaker. Finally, if things take a particularly boozy turn, fire up some karaoke through YouTube.And finally …Really, there’s no set formula. Follow your instincts, embrace comfort and concentrate on having fun. And, if in doubt, remember some salient words from Bosi:“Just don’t try too hard. Don’t try to impress is the wrong thing to say – you want to impress – but stay in your comfort zone. Stay comfortable, enjoy yourself, keep it simple – and have a good time.”Make like Bosi and kick off that good time with a Royal Sidecar or Rémy Grand Tonic of your own – buy a bottle here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3726e0cf652a6dff90d706ddbed00a8be919ab9e/175_494_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2c052b28675f210c2b825503ac758cbe 930w","title":"jet set tv shows carbon climate 2018","story":"From Killing Eve to The Crown, TV took globetrotting to a new level this year. We take a thoroughly unscientific look at the corresponding climate impact The big, pricey “drama as travelogue” has taken over this year. It has been a year of spies and aristocrats, characters commonly found scoffing the free pain au chocolat in the upper class lounge at your local airport. But at what cost to Mother Earth? Patrick Melrose seems like a nice guy, but is he actually the most rapacious planet-killer on telly? And the Queen in The Crown – well, she looks all prim on the notes, but how will she explain her CO2 emissions to flooded Mauritians? Here are the carbon footprints of TV’s biggest globe-hoppers.Spy vs Spy for the minibreak generation, Killing Eve delighted in dropping its characters in all the most self-consciously cliched espionage settings: Budapest gets a look-in, as do Berlin, Moscow, Paris and Tuscany (not forgetting Gravesend).Carbon miles verdict: Low in distance, but probably lots of faff with Ubers. Put them down for the equivalent of 10 London to Prague returns, which is 1.72 tonnes CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent, a unit for measuring carbon footprints).Reluctant Russian Alex inherits his dad’s global organised-crime firm and must go on a series of terrifying 18-30 holidays into the new drug-smuggling, gun-running, cash-evaporating netherworld. As the action flits between Mumbai, Cairo, Israel, Prague, Belgrade, Moscow and Zagreb, it soon becomes clear this man needs a pair of noise-cancelling headphones and a strip of zopiclone.Carbon miles verdict: Stick him with at least five return flights to Moscow: 2.11 tonnes CO2e.Despite their lavish sprawl, most of Mr and Mrs Regina’s travels were shot in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Cape Town subbed in for Melbourne, Hermanus became Corfu and the Queen’s gig inaugurating an independent Ghana was shot in the Castle of Good Hope. Only Antarctica had to be shot in a quarry near London. The carbon question is complicated by the fact that the jet age hasn’t yet roared to life and much of the travel takes place by boat, including Philip’s five-month Pacific tourstag do.Carbon miles verdict: According to Carnival Cruises, a cruise ship releases 1.17lb (0.53kg) of carbon per passenger mile. Stick Philip down for 8,000 miles, dependent on grass-skirted-maiden traffic. So, that’s 4,246kg, which is 4.24 tonnes CO2e.Budget airlines hadn’t been invented when the naive actor Charlie began her hell ride across the Indo-European landmass. Luckily, shadowy intelligence agencies had bigger budgets in those days. In her quest to learn how to act, Charlie finds herself in Greece, then Israel, Yugoslavia, Munich, Austria, Lebanon and Palestine.Carbon miles verdict: Mainly short-haul. But bombs are very carbon-intensive, however noble the cause. Stick her with a tonne for the semtex and let’s say the equivalent of eight return flights from London to Greece. That’s 3.24 tonnes CO2e.The novel idea of using Benedict Cumberbatch’s close-up face weeping in a variety of dimly lit exotic locales propelled Patrick Melrose to instant cult status. Melrose, a tipple-enjoying aristocrat coming to terms with the death of his abusive dad, spendt much of the series in New York, but he does get about, whether he remembers it or not. The finale featured his mother going from London to Switzerland to attend a kind of Dignitas clinic. It also featured Concorde – probably the wickedest carbon criminal on the list – plus escapes to the south of France and Connecticut.Carbon miles verdict: The final episodes are set in 2003, by which point planes were much more fuel-efficient. But Concorde is gonna cost you, guv. Put him down for five London to New York crossings: 4.8 tonnes CO2e.Results: Well, there you go. Amid terrorists, psychopathic hitwomen, next-gen mafiosos and Prince Philips, it is Melrose you want to watch out for.

The clip was shared by the New York City police department on Saturday, going viral and amassing more than 20,000 retweets.NYPD officers later managed to recover and clean the piece of jewellery, but could not find the couple so put out an appeal on Twitter.The tale quickly made headlines and the news soon reached the newly engaged pair, who had by then returned to the UK.“The (now) happy couple is back in their home country, but thanks to your retweets they heard we were looking for them!” the NYPD wrote on Sunday. “We’re making arrangements to get them their ring back. Congratulations!”Arrangements have been made to return the rescued ring to the pair in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, and the NYPD tweeted a photo of the smiling couple holding a celebratory drink to toast the unlikely outcome.In the photo, Anthony was seen wearing a ring on the traditional finger, although the couple said they abandoned plans to visit a jewellery store to replace the ring on discovering it had been found.“We are so happy, we can’t believe it,” they told the BBC on Sunday evening. Drennan explained that he had put a lot of thought into the proposal and had carried the ring in his pocket for two days.“I want to clarify that I did not propose over a grate in Times Square – that’s where we lost it,” he said, making clear that he actually asked the question in Central Park two hours earlier. “The time was right. There were autumn leaves everywhere and not many people.”Anthony said yes, but the ring was too big for her finger. “I tried to tell John it was too big, but he insisted I wear it,” she said.“I told her it was fine. I was just so happy to finally call her my fiancée after all this time,” Drennan added.“We were walking back to the hotel. I can still visualise the ring. Bouncing once… bouncing twice and then it was gone,” Drennan said. “We just presumed it was gone. In the end, we had no choice but to walk away and try to enjoy the rest of our weekend.”However, shortly after they touched down in the UK, a friend contacted them to ask whether they were indeed the couple the NYPD were searching for.“We could not believe it, we really thought it was gone,” Anthony said. “We don’t use Twitter – we had absolutely no idea this was going on. But we are so happy.”The couple added: “We are so thankful to everyone – especially the New York Police Department and everyone who shared our story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce11fec1435267e12cb4865ff8bd8f5144369e3c/0_658_4745_2848/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b1df73e12aa1f9108006fedf65a63b","title":"george hw bush a life in pictures","story":"George HW Bush, who has died aged 94, was the 41st president of the United States.

He said many of those arrested in battles with police were men aged between 30 and 40, often from regions far from Paris, who had “come to fight police while claiming to be part of the gilets jaunes movement”.The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, and his head of staff will be questioned by a senate committee on Tuesday over how thousands of protesters were able to play cat and mouse with police through central Paris for hours.Macron flew back from the G20 summit in Argentina on Sunday and went straight to inspect damage at the Arc de Triomphe. Graffiti all over the base of the 19-century monument read: “We’ve chopped off heads for less than this” and “Topple the Bourgeoisie.” Scores of used teargas canisters filled the gutters.Near the Champs Élysées there were splashes of paint on buildings after protesters had paint-bombed police. Used bottles of eye-drops on the ground indicated that some protesters – many of whom wore ski-masks and breathing equipment – stood their ground despite the teargas fired from rows of police behind shields.Along the Avenue Kléber near the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday morning, passersby peered at scorched pavements where the burnt-out carcasses of cars had been towed away, and where a private residence had been set alight. Graffiti read: “Babylon is burning.”The far-right leader Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the leftwing party La France Insoumise, both called on Macron to dissolve parliament and hold elections.The violence started on Saturday in broad daylight on the edges of a peaceful demonstration by the gilets jaunes movement, which began two weeks ago in protest at rising fuel prices and a new green fuel tax.After three successive Saturday citizens’ marches in Paris organised on social media, the security forces seemed at a loss to stop the rioting, with groups of masked men spilling into nearby streets, ripping up benches and traffic lights and hurling bits of paving stones from roadworks.An Élysée spokesman said Macron wanted policing procedures to be reviewed in terms of “maintaining order in the days to come”. No date was set for the prime minister to meet representatives from the gilets jaunes movement to revive talks that last week amounted to nothing.Demonstrators continued to stage small roadblocks in towns around France on Sunday. Other cities saw violent clashes between protesters and police on Saturday, notably Toulouse where 48 police officers were injured. In the town of Puy-en-Velay on Saturday, the prefect’s office briefly caught fire after it was petrol-bombed.Over the weekend more than 130,000 people demonstrated across France in the gilets jaunes movement, and there were more than 580 roadblocks around the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba3adc7b92229650df1713d7469af5c2dd9bfa55/0_25_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=434b522ae1114101eb4b759618284a5f","title":"hong kong pro democracy lawmaker barred from running in local election","story":"Eddie Chu told that his support for independence from China disqualified him from running in rural part of the New TerritoriesHong Kong authorities have barred a pro-democracy lawmaker from running in a local election for “implicitly” supporting Hong Kong’s independence from China, in what critics said was another instance of civil rights being eroded in the China-ruled cityEddie Chu, a former journalist who was democratically elected as one of Hong Kong’s 70 legislators in a 2016 election, had planned to contest a separate grassroots poll to represent a village in the rural hinterland of the New Territories.But an official with Hong Kong’s Electoral Affairs Commission, Enoch Yuen, wrote to Chu on Sunday to disqualify his candidacy on the grounds that Chu had previously expressed support for “independence as an option for Hong Kong people to self-determine their future”.While Chu had written to Yuen stating he didn’t support independence, she concluded that Chu’s answers: “When viewed objectively, can be understood as implicitly confirming that he supports independence could be an option for Hong Kong people”.Chu said he might challenge the “ridiculous” decision in court, and that he had been stripped of a fundamental political right at a time when Beijing has tightened its grip on the city.He pointed out that he was already an elected lawmaker with strong public backing, whose suitability for public office had never previously been questioned.“They need to clearly tell the people of Hong Kong ... how they can, without any public consultation or legislative process, change the threshold of political screening.”Hong Kong, a former British colony, reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 amid guarantees the territory would enjoy a high degree of autonomy and freedoms under a “one country, two systems” formula.Over the past year, however, international concern has spread over a series of incidents that have further undermined confidence in Hong Kong’s rights landscape, including the de facto expulsion of a British journalist after he hosted a speech by an independence activist at a press club.The move against Chu adds to a list of other democrats who have been banned from contesting elections, fuelling fears of tightening political “red lines” by Beijing that could deny Hong Kong’s disaffected young people any mainstream political careers beyond street protest.In a statement, a government spokesman said late on Sunday that the government “agrees to and supports the decision” to ban Chu. It also denied there had been “any political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections“.Hong Kong authorities say “self-determination“, or seeking greater autonomy from China, violates the city’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which states that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c13e69fe0db9ede1fd4b2f4fd937ff3a06580985/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a4c049e00486f373c62e7c2d4625ab8","title":"its real me nigerian president denies dying and being replaced by clone","story":"Muhammadu Buhari breaks silence about a rumour that has circulated on social media for monthsNigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has denied claims that he had died and was replaced by a Sudanese impostor, breaking his silence on a rumour that has circulated on social media for months.Buhari, who is running for re-election in February, spent five months in Britain last year being treated for an undisclosed illness.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPA Wire Extending mobile phone broadband coverage to 95 per cent of the State in geographical terms would cost €858 million, while extending it to 99.5 per cent would cost almost €1 billion more, according to new reports. While mobile network operators claim to be currently reaching “close to” 90 per cent geographical coverage, that claim may be “overstated”, according to the reports commissioned by Comreg, the communications regulator.The difference between extending coverage so that it reaches a higher proportion of the State’s area, as against a higher proportion of its population, is huge, the reports show.Because of this, consultants employed by ComReg have advised that new licences to mobile operators should carefully balance the desire to have extended geographical coverage, with the costs this entails.Extending mobile phone broadband coverage is a key element of the plan to increase national “connectivity”. But it is separate from, and is not designed to replace, the Government’s national fixed-line broadband plan, known as the rural broadband plan.Extending mobile broadband coverage to people rather than geographically, would be less expensive, the reports show. To reach 95 per cent of people it would cost €188 million, while extending coverage to 99.5 per cent of the population would cost €511 million. Extending coverage geographically to 99.5 per cent of the population would cost €1.8 billion.In EU terms, a particularly high proportion of the Republic’s population live in rural areas. And more than 70 per cent of houses in rural Ireland are categorised as one-off. The Republic’s road density is also twice the European average. One of the reports suggests resources might be better spent on other things, rather than on trying to extend mobile broadband geographically beyond certain levels.“Extensive mobile interventions could be inefficient, given the higher social values that could be generated from an alternative allocation of the resources that would be necessary to deliver this,” according to Frontier. “As such, any future obligations or interventions should be designed around Ireland’s distinct characteristics and recognise the cost of achieving certain targets.” In a companion report by Oxera Consulting and Real Wireless, the authors said any effort to increase the level of mobile broadband coverage above 90 per cent of the population required careful assessment of the costs and benefits involved.Comreg said achieving high levels of mobile broadband coverage on a geographic basis would require operators to have two to four times as many cell sites as they have today and could not be done on a market basis. “The overall cost to stakeholders would likely be substantial.”Achieving almost total geographic coverage might require almost 6,000 new cell sites, many of them in challenging terrain, Oxera estimated. “People in Ireland want to use mobile devices for voice and data services, whenever they need to and wherever they are,” said Jeremy Godfrey, ComReg commissioner. It was Comreg’s aim “to support them to the greatest extent practical”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3709939.1543164372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"suspect device the all metal hip replacement that caused untold hardship","story":"The DePuy ASR hip launched in 2004, was promoted as a game changer in orthopaedics, with 3,300 patients receiving the hip in Ireland.  Problems were discovered, resulting in its recall in Ireland in 2010. Video: Bryan O’Brien Report: Colm Keena\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGillian O’Sullivan: ‘He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.’Scandals involving breast implants and all-metal hips prosthetics have raised global concerns and prompted regulatory reform in the European Union. Now the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has conducted a major investigation into the medical device sector.The debacle that is the DePuy metal hip illuminates the ways medical devices are brought to market and the mayhem that can ensue if a product fails to live up to expectations.On a per capita basis, more of the DePuy hips were implanted in Ireland than in any other jurisdiction. In excess of 1,000 Irish patients have issued proceedings against DePuy. Hundreds have already settled.When Gillian O’Sullivan gets up from her chair to fetch some hip X-rays, you can’t but notice that one of her legs is shorter than the other.One of the difficulties with replacing hips is that the artificial implants wear out. As bone and tissue get destroyed when prosthetics are being implanted, replacing worn-out implants with new ones is not a simple matter. For this reason, the practice has been to wait until people are older, and less active, before giving them artificial hips. If you get the timing right, the patient may be dead before the hip implant has failed.But in the early 2000s, hip implant manufacturers started to market new, longer-lasting implants they said were suited to younger, active people.In 2005, when she was 40, Gillian O’Sullivan went to see the highly regarded local orthopaedic surgeon, Tadhg O’Sullivan, in the Waterford Regional Hospital. She was suffering from arthritis.“He told me there was a lovely new hip on the market that could last a lifetime . . . I would never look back.”Her surgeon was referring to a new metal product from DePuy, a subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and a major manufacturer of orthopaedic products. The so-called ASR hip came in two variants. One was a hip resurfacing device, which covered the cup and ball of the hip socket, while the second was a total hip replacement product, which involved replacing the top of the femur with a metal device, which then sat into the metal cup.Both products differed from what was previously on the market in that both traditional hip implants used a metal ball and a polyethylene or plastic cup. The DePuy hip had a ball and cup made out of a hard-wearing cobalt chromium metal alloy.Tadhg O’Sullivan was one of six design surgeons who had worked with DePuy’s engineers to design the new product. It is standard practice for innovative new products to be developed with the assistance of clinicians.At the time he saw Gillian O’Sullivan, the Waterford surgeon was showing surgeons around the world how to implant the new product, and taking part in post-market surveillance of how the product was performing.In October 2005, Gillian O’Sullivan had a DePuy hip replacement device implanted on her left side at the Kilcreene Orthopaedic Hospital in Kilkenny. In May 2006, her second hip was replaced. She was told she now had the “hips of Brian O’Driscoll”.However, her operations were difficult and she experienced pain afterwards.“By Christmas 2006 we knew I was in trouble. I had no energy levels, I was really sick, and you could hear me coming down the stairs. There was a click, click, click, every time I moved.”Her children could hear the grinding of her metal hips.In May 2007, she went back to Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I said, I’m in trouble here. He argued with me. He said I was in better condition than I had been.”She was told that “the god of orthopaedics” had performed her hip operation and that she should wait and see.By this stage O’Sullivan had moved from the Waterford Regional Hospital to the private Whitfield Clinic, also in Waterford. “Between 2007 and 2010, I was in an awful state. I would say to myself, I think I am dying.”Gillian O’Sullivan now believes that during the years 2007 to 2011, metal ions from her hip implants were progressively damaging the flesh and bone of her hip joints.When the DePuy hip was withdrawn from the market in August 2010, Irish patients were advised that their future care would involve the monitoring of the cobalt and chromium levels in their blood.After the withdrawal, Gillian O’Sullivan got a letter for an appointment at the Whitfield and Tadhg O’Sullivan warned her that she would be hearing a lot of public debate about cobalt and chromium ion levels in the blood. He said it was “all bullshit”.“They are trying to frighten everybody.”She went to see Jimmy Sheehan at the Blackrock Clinic again and brought along her blood test results which showed very high metal ion levels. “He said, you need to get those hips out now. They’re poisoning you.”In 2011, the right hip was replaced by O’Sullivan at the Whitfield, and a year later the second hip was also replaced. The operations, which were paid for by DePuy, were difficult, she said, and left her with a left leg that was longer than her right.During her original operations and subsequent operations Gillian O’Sullivan met a number of other patients who were having DePuy hips implanted or replaced by Tadhg O’Sullivan. Among those she met was Kiera Kenneally, who had DePuy hips implanted by Tadhg O’Sullivan in 2005 and 2006, the first when she was just 16 years old.Kenneally, who now lives in Sandyford, Dublin, is originally from Hillview, Waterford, and Gillian O’Sullivan knew her family. Kenneally sued DePuy. Her case was heard over a number of days in the High Court in 2016, but the case was settled with the agreement including a confidentiality clause. However, the transcripts from the sitting days have been seen by The .In August 2005, Kenneally had a resurfacing procedure done by O’Sullivan in Kilcreene. In May of the following year, the second hip was resurfaced.The left hip implant was replaced by O’Sullivan in 2010. During the operation, substantial metal ion damage to her hip tissue was discovered and there was substantial loss of bone.Blood tests taken afterwards showed cobalt and chromium blood levels that were, respectively, 10 and four times above what would be expected, the High Court was told.Kenneally has since been advised she may in time need to have a Girdlestone procedure, which fuses the femur to the hip so that it can no longer bend. She may end up in a wheelchair.The medical records in Kenneally’s case showed that before her procedure, Tadgh O’Sullivan discussed both with her and her mother the concept of metal-on-metal hips, the possibility of failure, and the issue of debris (which in turn leads to the release of ions).Gillian O’Sullivan also sued DePuy. During her High Court action, she says, DePuy “fought me all the way”.She also enlisted Nargol as an expert witness and he told the court that 90-95 per cent of her problems were due to the DePuy implants. DePuy argued that 90-95 per cent of her difficulties were due to her congenital condition.Mr Justice Kevin Cross decided that 90 per cent of O’Sullivan’s difficulties were referable to the DePuy hips, and awarded her €740,000. DePuy said it would appeal and the matter was then settled for €520,000.Unusually for people who made settlements with DePuy, Gillian O’Sullivan did not agree to a “gagging” clause and so is free to discuss her experience.In his judgment in November 2016, Mr Justice Cross said O’Sullivan was an “honest historian” who did not consciously exaggerate, but that her difficulties prior to her hip operations were greater than she recalled.As was the case with the Kenneally trial, Tadgh O’Sullivan was not a party in the O’Sullivan case, was not called by either side, and no one criticised his surgical skills. The judge said he accepted that O’Sullivan’s relationship with her surgeon had broken down some time after the second DePuy implant operation.O’Sullivan would need future revisions and would continue to be severely disabled for the rest of her life, the judge said. “The plaintiff will also be in significant pain, probably for life.”Gillian O’Sullivan says, reflecting on what’s happened to her: “You make the most of your life. I can’t be on a beach. The balance is completely gone, and I would fall over nothing. I get pains and contractions. I was in bed for six weeks after Christmas.”She is a mix of being surprisingly upbeat, while also occasionally displaying a fierce sense of resentment towards Tadhg O’Sullivan. “I live my life. If I’m upright for the day, I’m happy.”The DePuy hip debacle may end up costing DePuy up to $4 billion (€3.53 billion) in damages. Other producers of metal hip implants are also being sued.Although figures are not available for the Republic, total damages of up to €80 million may yet be paid to Irish recipients of DePuy hips, with legal costs in addition to that. It is the largest corporate personal injuries episode to ever hit the Irish legal system.Despite the challenges a metal-on-metal product presented, a new all-metal hip resurfacing product, known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) system, made by Smith \u0026amp Nephew, came on the market in the late 1990s and began to prove popular.The device was attractive for young, active people with hip problems, and Tadhg O’Sullivan was an early fan. A former GAA player himself, O’Sullivan was known for treating young athletes with joint problemsO’Sullivan told The  that it was because of his extensive use of the Birmingham hip that he was invited to work with DePuy in relation to its new product. At the time “I was probably one of the most experienced hip resurfacing surgeons in the world.”Companies developing new implants often engage surgeons to assist them. Although DePuy engineers put a huge amount of work into designing their new product, this did not including clinical trials, something that was not necessary under EU rules.Simulator tests were used, but critics say the tests did not replicate the repeated stop and start motion that is intrinsic to human joint use, and were restricted to larger model components, the sort used by larger framed people.“It would have been a very good design process if they were designing a washing machine,” says Trinity College Dublin engineering professor David Taylor. “They seem to have forgotten that it was going into a human being.”Taylor, who specialises in materials that are inserted into the body, has acted for a number of people who are suing DePuy. For him, a critical failure made by the DePuy engineers was not testing the proposed product on people prior to going to market.The head of medical device regulation in Ireland, Dr Niall MacAleenan, speaking generally, said clinical testing of medical device products was complicated by the fact that many devices were designed to be inside the body for years if not decades.Assessments as to the suitability of implanted devices involves a “risk benefit” assessment. “There is always risk. The question is if it is an acceptable level of risk.”In January 2004, DePuy got approval from a UK notified body, BSI, to market its two metal hip products throughout the EU. Approval across other, non-EU markets soon followed.For the US market, the company had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which was considered a tougher regulatory authority than the multi-agency structure operating in the EU.English surgeon Tony Nargol was an early enthusiast for the new DePuy product. In September 2003, he travelled to Rome for the product launch, where he met Tadhg O’Sullivan and some of the other design surgeons. He agreed to become involved in a clinical study of the device to be used to seek approval for the product in the United States, and also to become an “opinion leader” for the device in the UK.Between 2004 and 2009, the Newcastle surgeon implanted about 500 of the metal devices, making him one of the highest users of the product in the world.However, by late 2006 a number of his patients were presenting with difficulties. Nargol began to study the performance of the DePuy product in his patients, working with hospital colleague Simon Jameson.Among the matters they began to examine was the role played by the “angle” of implantation of the cup. They also began to notice that it was smaller models of the device, used in smaller framed persons, that appeared to be causing the most difficulties.When he revised the DePuy hip in some of his patients, Nargol noted a “greenish grey” fluid in the hip joint while doing so. This was “tissue necrosis”, he told the courts in Australia in an affidavit in 2013.In early 2007, he asked Ian Newell, DePuy’s regional manager in the Newcastle area, if he knew of other cases involving greenish grey fluid and tissue necrosis. “Mr Newell replied that he was ‘not aware of any’,” Nargol said in his affidavit.The response he got from DePuy caused Nargol to think that the problems he was encountering were caused by his work rather than the product.At a meeting with Newell and others in a hotel in Durham in September 2007, Nargol discussed the apparent link between smaller devices and high ion levels.In response, Newell showed him the data from a DePuy study of 89 patients who had received the hips in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Germany. The study subjected them to regular blood-testing to see if their cobalt and chromium ion levels became elevated.In November 2007, two papers about the DePuy hips were presented at the American Academy of Hip and Knee Surgeons conference in Dallas, Texas, one by Nargol and one by Graham Isaac, the DePuy engineer who led the team that designed the new product. Both flagged problems with the device.Isaac’s paper was entitled Whole Blood Metal Ion Levels after Surface Replacement of the Hip the effect of Component Positioning, and the authors included Isaac, Tadgh O’Sullivan and the other design surgeons, as well as a surgeon from South Africa. The authors reported that 24 months after their procedures, the ion levels for 50 patients (40 male and 10 female) showed three female (30 per cent) and three males (7.5 per cent) had significantly higher ion levels than would be expected.These elevated levels were associated with their devices being implanted at particular angles, the conference was told.DePuy, O’Sullivan and the other authors were saying the negative outcomes were related to how the devices were implanted rather than attributable to any defects in the device.During 2008, Nargol continued to have regular contact with Isaac, Newell and other DePuy representatives. He also began to notice patients with difficulties whose implants had been put in at an angle that was at or near the “safe zone” that he and his colleagues had identified from their research.In time, Nargol came to believe that the product was at fault, not his work as a surgeon. The implants put in at particular angles tended to fail earlier than others, and so created the early impression that the angle was the source of the problem.In August 2008, Nargol stopped using the complete hip replacement product and in early 2009 he stopped using the DePuy resurfacing product also.A colleague, surgeon David Langton, had by this time noticed a new problem with the DePuy implant called “edge-loading”, which contributed to high wear and debris and was, in Langton’s view, the result of the design of the DePuy product.During a meeting with Isaac on March 11th, 2009, at DePuy’s offices in Leeds, Langton and Nargol outlined their latest findings.Nargol said there were problems with the DePuy product even when it was implanted at the recommended angle. There was a “design flaw”, especially with smaller cups.One of the DePuy representatives at the meeting said, “we’re f**ked”, Nargol said in his Australian affidavit. Isaac said the problem was “multifactorial”, with the factors involved including patient weight and activity levels.Requests submitted through DePuy for interviews with Isaac and Newell were declined.In time Nargol became one of the harshest critics globally of the DePuy product. He and Langton became involved in litigation around the world as patients sued DePuy for damages. Nargol, along with Langton, gave evidence in a lot of these cases and the surgeons are party to continuing proceedings in the US where, as designated whistleblowers, they stand to make significant amounts of money if DePuy ends up having to pay out to the US Government for implants sold to public health programmes.The judge did not have to rule on the mala fides issue because of the position adopted by DePuy in the trial, but he rejected the attack on Nargol’s evidence. He said the expert witnesses for both sides had given honest evidence. Nargol would not be interviewed by The  because of the ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions.In 2010, by way of his involvement in litigation, Nargol discovered that other surgeons had expressed concerns during the mid-2000s about the DePuy product, contrary to what he said he had been told by DePuy.The highly regarded Belfast orthopaedic surgeon, David Beverland, told Nargol he had stopped using the DePuy product in early 2007. Requests from The  to Beverland for an interview met with no response.Nargol contacted Beverland in 2010 after being told by a former DePuy employee that the Belfast surgeon had experienced problems with his patients.In his Australian affidavit, Nargol quoted a 2010 email from Beverland to Isaac: “All in all, this ASR problem has to date been the worst problem I have faced in my surgical career. It has been a real nightmare.”Nargol also said that in 2010 he was shown emails from the Dutch surgeon Paul Born to a DePuy executive, dated June 2006, in which he said he’d experienced a significant failure rate with DePuy and would no longer be using the product.Nargol said that on several occasions during 2007 and 2008 he had asked Newell, Isaac and their colleague Magnus Flett if other surgeons were noticing similar problems to him.“Mr Newell, Mr Flett, and Mr Isaac told me on several occasions that ‘no one else has had any problems with the ASR’.”The DePuy metal hip was voluntarily recalled in August 2010 after figures from the National Joint Registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland showed it was performing badly when compared with its peers.The registry collects information on all joint replacement operations so as to measure the performance of the different implants that are on the market.In its most recent annual report, the registry said that for the 992,090 hip replacements monitored since it began collecting data in 2002, some 7.27 per cent have been replaced (or revised, as the medical term goes).The replacement rate would be lower if it were not for metal-on-metal implants which showed a replacement rate of 19-22 per cent. The most successful type of hip replacement, metal-on-polyethylene, had a replacement rate of 4.87 per cent.“Metal-on-metal resurfacings have a revision rate at 14 years of 14.76 per cent and their use, as with all metal-on-metal bearings, is now very limited.”After DePuy withdrew its product from the market, there was extensive discussion as to how it had been approved for sale in the first place.The EU and the United States are the world’s two most important bodies when it comes to the regulation of the medical devices sector. In the EU, there are multiple “notified bodies” each of which can award CE marks to proposed new medical devices, thereby allowing them be marketed across the union.In Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is the body that licenses new medical devices, while the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has a role in monitoring the safety of devices that are on the market.The DePuy products were approved by BSI, a UK-notified body. Clinical trials were not required under EU rules, even though the products are recognised as among the higher-risk category of medical devices. Approval by an EU-certified body opened the way to the devices being marketed in other economies, including Australia and South Africa. Many of the world’s poorer nations rely on the developed world for the regulation of medical devices.In the US, the FDA decided that the DePuy hip resurfacing product was a significantly new product and required clinical testing. It allowed the marketing of the total hip replacement product.In 2009, DePuy was told confidentially by the FDA that it would not be granting approval for the hip resurfacing product after reviewing company studies that showed it had failed prematurely in “significant” numbers. In response the multinational quietly withdrew its request for approval.The DePuy hip replacement product was approved for the US market by way of a controversial pathway called “substantial equivalence”.Medical devices can be approved for the market in both the EU and the US if they can be shown to be substantially equivalent to a product already on the market, or if they can be shown to be made of parts that are substantially the same as parts already on the market.The rule applies even if the device or parts already approved have since been withdrawn, even for poor performance reasons.As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine put it in January 2013, approval by the FDA by way of substantial equivalence “does not mean that a new device is safe and effective: it means that the device is deemed no less safe and no less effective than a predicate”.The study looked at how the DePuy hip replacement device came to be approved for implantation in US citizens. It found that the lineage of the device involved 95 different devices or device parts that had operated as predicate devices or parts to which DePuy said its new product was substantially equivalent.The predicate devices included ones that were “discontinued long ago because their risk of revision was so much higher than that of other hip” products, the authors noted.The NSAI was not able to tell The  how many higher risk devices it had approved over the past decade by way of equivalence, or how many had been approved after clinical trials, even though the information was sought as far back as September 3rd last.However, MacAleenan of the HPRA points out that precisely because implanted medical devices designed to last a long time inside the body are hard to subject to pre-market clinical testing, the data that comes from devices that are already on the market is particularly valuable.There is another interesting aspect to the substantial equivalence phenomenon both here and in the US, according to a Newcastle University biomedical engineer, Tom Joyce, who has extensively studied the DePuy debacle“It happens all the time that a product comes onto market via substantial equivalence, meaning that it is supposed to be similar to a product already on the market, but it is then marketed as if it is wildly different,” said Joyce, who has worked with Nargol and Langon on behalf of Irish plaintiffs.The EU is currently introducing a new regime for the certification of medical devices that is in part a response to the DePuy hip and other high-profile failures.Tadhg O’Sullivan told The  that up to the date that the DePuy products were withdrawn, he never had a problem with any of his resurfacing patients.Despite the global controversy over the performance of DePuy hip, there is no mistaking O’Sullivan’s continuing enthusiasm for the product.During a lengthy interview in his consultation rooms in the Whitfield Clinic, O’Sullivan said the DePuy implant was an important innovation for patients with serious hip problems.Asked if in his view there was a design flaw with the DePuy hip resurfacing device, his answer was simple: “Not really. If put in properly, no.”Likewise, he said he did not believe there was a flaw with the ball and cup of the total hip replacement product, though there was a problem with the stem that attached it to the patient’s femur.He believed that DePuy, and J\u0026ampJ, were probably acting on the advice of lawyers when they decided to withdraw the product from the market. The decision, he says, was the equivalent of saying: “Sue the f**k out of us.”And that, he said, is what has happened.DePuy has “pumped an outrageous amount of money into putting this thing right. Unfortunately, the more they pump in, the more our legal profession want. They’re like an insatiable dog.”As well as assisting the DePuy engineers and attending design team meetings over a number of years, O’Sullivan was also the co-inventor of two patents registered in the name of DePuy that were associated with the hip product.Publicly available information in the US indicates that the two US design surgeons who worked with O’Sullivan on the DePuy project, Tom Schmalzried and Thomas Veil, received a number of million dollars each in royalties and other payments from the manufacturer.However, O’Sullivan says his royalty income from DePuy was “relatively small” and that if the time he had spent as a design surgeon travelling to meetings and conferences for DePuy had instead been spent working at the Whitfield Clinic he would have been equally well rewarded.He has earned more from DePuy as a result of the programme it has put in place for patients post the withdrawal of the hip product than he did while working as a design surgeon, he said.The enormous global medical legal battle that has erupted since the product was recalled has led to a great amount of misinformation coming into the public domain, the surgeon said. “We have poor people coming in here thinking they are going to die.” It is “very hard to get at the truth when there is a huge amount of money to be made from suing a company”. he added.O’Sullivan said he had not seen one paper which, read closely, showed heightened cobalt and chromium levels causing medical problems. Yet people were coming to him now, he said, with normal ageing problems such as becoming forgetful, and blaming it on their ion levels.The patient may feel fantastic, and may have no problem with their hips, but he tells them the only way to get their ion levels down is “to take out the generator”. It is their choice.Surgeons want to do what is best for their patients, he said. The DePuy project was about “trying to help people of 30 years of age who needed a hip and not be sending them home and have them not working for the next 20 years.”As matters now stand, most metal hip products have been withdrawn from the market and all major manufacturers are producing a similar ceramic ball and cup product. “They’re all giving you the basic Ford Focus.”The threat of being sued means doctors feel pressurised into doing what is safest in terms of legal exposure, rather than what is most appropriate for their patients.Surgeons know that if they put in a product that has been around for decades, but which fails, they cannot be sued, he said. And manufacturers, if they are going to fear being sued, are deterred from creating new devices.The loser in the end, he says, because of the stifling of innovation, is the patient.A special alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process has been put in place by the Irish courts such is the level of claims that have been lodged against DePuy over its metal hip product.The highest award to date has been €750,000, but the average is in the region of €100,000. If a settlement is not agreed, a claimant can take their case to court.As of July, 540 of the 1,108 sets of proceedings lodged against DePuy had been resolved. Many of the proceedings lodged do not qualify for the ADR.A spokeswoman for DePuy said she would not give a figure for total awards made in Ireland to date.“DePuy has no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,” she said in a statement to The . “We are committed to the wellbeing of our patients and believe the full history of the ASR system shows we have worked properly and responsibly to improve patients’ lives through innovation.“We will continue to stand by our patients.”A special investigation by The  in association with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717781.1543783480!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"departments clash over changes to short term rentals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Housing Eoghan Murphy and Minister for Tourism Shane Ross. Documents acquired under Freedom of Information show their respective departments clashed over changes to the short-term rental sector. File photographs: Dara Mac Dónaill and Alan BetsonThe The Department of Housing tried to foist the responsibility for major changes to the short-term rental sector on to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but was rebuffed by Shane Ross’s officials, new documents reveal.Last month, the Minister for Housing, Eoghan Murphy, announced that short-term lets through websites such as Airbnb will be restricted to the owner’s primary residence and capped at three months a year, while owners of second homes or investment properties will be banned from short-term letting unless they have planning permission.Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that Mr Murphy’s senior officials tried to make the Department of Transport take responsibility for pushing through the changes, saying that the regulations would “primarily benefit the tourist sector”.Mr Murphy said last month that the measures were designed to help alleviate the housing crisis.Senior officials in the Department of Transport rejected the call and said that it would be “inappropriate” for them to take responsibility.Attempts to charge the Minister of State in the Department of Tourism, Brendan Griffin, with responsibility for the new regulations were also described in correspondence between housing officials as “not an easy sell”.On August 7th the secretary general of the Department of Housing, John McCarthy, wrote to the secretary general of the Department of Tourism, Graham Doyle:“Taking account of the existing regulatory regime that already exists within the tourism sector and the role that Fáilte Ireland already plays in overseeing key tourist accommodation sectors, it has been proposed by our Ministers that your department and its agencies are the best fit to oversee the development of regulation in this area, which will primarily benefit the tourist sector and facilitate a more managed approach to short-term tourist lettings around the country.”Mr Doyle responded on August 29th rebuffing the requests. He acknowledged “a regulatory regime exists for specific forms of accommodations within the tourism sector”.“Given that the main issues requiring detailed consideration fall within the remit of your department, and having raised the matter with Ministers Ross and Griffin, it is appropriate that your department would lead the development of the general approach and undertake the consultation process. The policy expertise, existing legal provisions and the practical known how within your department and its agencies will facilitate a fuller and more expedient consideration of the issues.“In summary, while it would not be appropriate for this department to lead this important work, we do stand ready to support and be consulted on the tourism-related matters that arise.”Further correspondence on October 25th reveals concerns about potentially needing legislation to enact the changes.Paul Dunne, an official in the department, wrote to a number of other key officials in the Departments of Housing, Finance and Transport.“You will no doubt have heard that the Minister intends to move forward on short-term lettings by way of amendment to the planning regulations. The Minister is of the view that while there may be a need for primary legislation that it will take 12-16 months to enact and this is too long a timeframe. There is a need to take shorter-term measures to help alleviate homelessness in parts of the county that are under pressure in relation to available accommodations.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3717746.1543781108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish citizens in north unlikely to have vote in european elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMicheál Martin referred to how tens of thousands of people from Northern Ireland hold Irish passports and therefore were “Irish citizens” and “European citizens”. Photograph: Alan BetsonAn internal Government note appears to dampen hopes that Irish citizens in Northern Ireland will be allowed to vote in European elections post-Brexit.The Government has identified a series of obstacles to the proposal, which are aimed at giving a EU franchise to Northern Irish residents after the UK leaves the European Union next March.Ireland is getting two additional MEPs when the UK leaves, bringing its total representation to 13, while Northern Ireland will lose its three seats in the European Parliament.Sinn Féin has called for the new MEP seats to be given to Northern Ireland.An internal government note has revealed, however, that major changes to Ireland’s electoral laws would be needed for this to happen.“From a practical franchise perspective, there would be a number of challenges associated with such a proposal given our electoral laws, as they currently stand, do not provide for voting from outside of the State, except in very limited circumstances,” the note reads, giving the example of diplomats and members of the Defence Forces serving overseas.Because of this there would be a need to set up an electoral register for such a purpose and to establish criteria around the eligibility to vote.Clarity would also be needed around who would maintain the register. Currently each local authority compiles and maintains a register of its own administrative area. Constituencies would have to be agreed, and it would also have to be agreed how a person would vote in practice, for example with a postal vote.Rules would also need to be set out in relation to who would have responsibility for the counting of votes, which is currently carried out by local returning officers.“In brief, the allocation of European Parliament seats to Northern Ireland would require a number of key policy decisions to be made by Government which would likely give rise to substantive changes to our European Parliament Elections Act 1997,” the note reads.The note states that the issue of allocating Irish European Parliament seats to Northern Ireland was not considered by the European Parliament Constituency Committee during its deliberations on the review of European Parliament constituencies “on the basis that this issue was outside of its terms of reference”.The issue of potentially changing allocation will probably become an issue for the Department of Foreign Affairs.Sinn Féin previously accused the Taoiseach of leaving Irish citizens from Northern Ireland behind by not allowing them to vote in European elections after Brexit.MEP Martina Anderson said the Irish Government could change its electoral rules with the “flick of a pen” to enable people north of the Border to vote in future European Parliament polls.Mr Martin referred to how tens of thousands of people from Northern Ireland hold Irish passports and therefore were “Irish citizens” and “European citizens”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate.” Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPGetty ImagesToronto: the snow is falling lightly.I’m feeling something foreign, something I’ve never felt before. It takes me a moment to identify it.I’m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I’ve covered Bill and Hillary, I’ve experienced a range of emotions. They’ve dazzled me and they’ve disgusted me.But now they’re mystifying me.I’m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it’s a depressing sight. It’s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organisers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons’ audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I’m still looking at large swathes of empty seats – and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamouring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It’s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who’s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons’ range.I can’t fathom why the Clintons would make like ageing rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the United States at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It’s not inspirational. It’s not for charity. They’re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They’re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can’t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons’ tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.After the White House, the money-grubbing raged on, with the Clintons making more than 700 speeches in a 15-year period, blithely unconcerned with any appearance of avarice or of shady special interests and foreign countries buying influence. They stockpiled a whopping $240 million. Even leading up to her 2016 presidential run, Hillary was packing in the speeches, talking to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the American Camp Association, eBay, and there was that infamous trifecta of speeches for Goldman Sachs worth $675,000.“What scares me the most is Hillary’s smug certainty of her own virtue as she has become greedy and how typical that is of so many chic liberals who seem unaware of their own greed,” Charlie Peters, the legendary liberal former editor of the Washington Monthly, told me. “They don’t really face the complicity of what’s happened to the world, how selfish we’ve become and the horrible damage of screwing the workers and causing this resentment that the Republicans found a way of tapping into.” He ruefully worries about the Obamas in this regard, too.Indeed, in the era of Trump, greed is not only good. It’s grand. The stock market is our highest value. Mammonism rules.But watching the Clintons hash over their well-worn tale of falling in love at Yale Law School, I realise that it’s not only about the money.Some in Clintonworld say Hillary fully intends to be the nominee. Once more, in Toronto, she didn’t rule it out, dodging the question with a lame joke. She carries herself with the air of a president in exile. Her consigliere, Philippe Reines, has prodded reporters on including her name when they write about 2020 candidates.And Bill has given monologues to old friends about how Hillary knows how she’d have to run in 2020, that she couldn’t have a big staff and would just speak her mind and not focus-group everything. (That already sounds focus-grouped.)After losing to an orange puffer clown fish who will go down as one of the most destructive forces in American history and flushing the Obama legacy down the drain, that’s delusional. Some Obama associates say the former president has some regrets about throwing his support solely behind Hillary and knows he misread the anger and frustration of voters.Bill was radioactive in the midterms and Hillary was the Ghost of Christmas Past. Her approval rating is at a record low of 36 per cent. The only American who seems truly interested in her these days is president Donald Trump, who can’t stop tweeting about her. She’s still money in his book.The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate. The way that the whole thing came crashing down in 2016 is too hard for them to bear. They would like to rewrite the ending, but there is no way to do that.Nothing they have done lately suggests that they have learned anything, including their obtuse post-#MeToo comments about Monica Lewinsky, who has been far more candid and sympathetic in the 20th anniversary retellings of the impeachment saga. The Clintons are still unable to hold themselves accountable. The formerly golden couple who dominated their party for nearly three decades is travelling North America in a bubble, shockingly un-self-aware.Their pathological need to be relevant in America is belied by a Canadian arena, where stretches of empty seats bear witness to the passing of their relevance.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He was, claims the historian, soon to be found constantly by her side.La Mothe Fénélon wrote that Queen Elizabeth often had “a very jovial and happy face” when she was around him, whether they were hunting, dining or discussing politics together.Her admiration appeared to have been reciprocated. He wrote to King Charles IX of France of her hunting prowess, describing his awe when he saw her hunting “fallow deer with a crossbow.”Crossbows were viewed as powerful weapons, often used by soldiers and nobles, and required significant upper-body strength they were not usually used by women.La Mothe Fénélon also, unusually, wrote of her good looks, telling French court in a letter, writing one day that she greeted him, “having decorated her court, being herself well dressed and looking as a wonder.He remarked on the fact that she was “better dressed than usual”  Dr Paranque said: I think what\u0027s happened is that he admired her and I think that we can be a bit suspicious about the fact that maybe he had a crush on her. He liked spending time with her.It\u0027s very clear that he enjoyed having after dinner conversations with her, she spoke to him for a long time.She also blamed him for having forgotten her when he hadn\u0027t seen her for a long time.It was not really the sort of ambassadorial rhetoric. They definitely had a friendship.More is revealed in Dr Paranque\u0026#39s new bookAlso in my book it\u0027s striking the ways in which he described her to his masters, to the French rulers, he said she was a rock which is a very strong word and said she looked a wonder, and that she\u0027s magnificent.”After enjoying his company at dinner, the Queen frequently took him to her private chamber  to seek his advice on political matters, such as her concerns about her rival for the throne, Mary, Queen of Scots.Their meetings were secretive he writes: “the next day I was going to find the said Lady, who drew me off in a corridor aside.”As well as having the usual official diplomatic discussions, the two discussed private matters while hunting, during snatched conversations in corridors and in the corner of her private chamber.On 18th January 1572, a the French ambassador wrote to Catherine de Medici that “she ordered me to bring a stool, and led me to sit next to her in a corner of her private chamber.”Dr Paranque said: “These secret locations where no one else was invited further demonstrate that Elizabeth and La Mothe Fénélon did not want their friendship to be discovered. Maybe she was confessing something personal? We cannot be sure, but La Mothe Fénélon’s tone indicates these interactions were not considered entirely proper behaviour.”During these conversations, they discussed a potential marriage to Henri, Duke of Anjou, older brother of François, Duke of Alençon.Dr Paranque added: “In many ways, by being the intermediate between Henri and Elizabeth, the French ambassador ended up being the one wooing the Queen.”Her book, Elizabeth I of England through Valois Eyes, Power, Representation, and Diplomacy in the Reign of the Queen, 1558–1588, is available to order online now.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces showdown over legal advice on Brussels dealWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?What is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Doctor Who stars reject claim the show has become too PC Revealed: The Brexit legal advice that could see Britain trapped in customs backstopStory of the Calais Jungle reaches New York after refugee actors overcome Trump travel banComment: Poor Angela Merkel - at Christmas time we all know the awkward horror of forgetting a colleague\u0026#39s nameNorth Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39pink lady\u0026#39 off air as state TV revamped with younger facesComment: Norway-plus will satisfy most of our Brexit goalsThrift chic pushes Prince Charles up GQ best dressed listWoman killed on train \u0026#39may have put head out of window\u0026#39British couple thank New York police for finding ring after fumbled proposalUN plane to evacuate wounded Houthi rebels from Yemen ahead of peace talks\u0026#39It\u0026#39s real me\u0026#39: Nigerian president denies being replaced by cloneMichelle Obama tells Meghan Markle: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be in a hurry\u0026#39 to launch ambitious projectsNicola Sturgeon urges MPs to seek Article 50 extension and rule out a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitDynasties: Brutal scene in Painted Wolves episode made director illA \u0026#39generation of innovators\u0026#39 has been appointed to run the military in a shake-up of the top ranks of the Army, Navy and RAFMI6 chief calls for new era of spying using AI and robots to combat rogue statesSpain reels as far-Right Vox party storms into Andalucian parliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/02/TELEMMGLPICT000182485471_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwePFmKi039RFXPfYiddX0aA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"doctor stars reject claim show has become pc","story":"Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole dismissed claims that Doctor Who had become too politicalDoctor Who stars have rejected claims that the show has become too PC, with one actor asking whether it is even possible to be \u0027too\u0027 correct.Mandip Gill and Tosin Cole, who play Yaz and Ryan in the show, instead praised the programme in an interview with Radio Times for being an entertaining reminder of important issues. Ms Gill said she believed the programme was \u0027creating conversation\u0027 on important issues.  It makes me laugh, because having the words \u0027too\u0027 and \u0027correct\u0027 in the same sentence is really bizarre to me. How can you be too correct about something?, she said.You do see some extreme comments under news articles. I\u0027m only human and I do check and read them. But they don\u0027t bother me and actually they\u0027re creating conversation.Jodie Whittaker became the first female actress to play Doctor Who earlier this yearThe appointment of Josie Whittaker as the first female Doctor in July was widely met with praise. Ms Gill and Mr Cole were brought on-board at the same time, along with Bradley Walsh, to play the doctor\u0027s companions in the series. Fans have reported a change in tone since Ms Whittaker stepped into the tardis, with storylines focussing on racism, intolerance and other social issues.Two recent episodes have dealt with sensitive historical issues. \u0027Demons of the Punjab\u0027 saw Ms Whittaker visit India in 1947 against the backdrop of partition while another episode retold the story of Rosa Parks and the struggle for civil rights. Bradley Walsh, Tosin Coll and Mandip Gill play Doctor Who\u0026#39s three companionsFans commented on the controversial use of language during the prime time episode, including use of the words \u0027paki\u0027 and \u0027negro\u0027.But Mr Cole denied the recent historical episodes were too political saying they were instead encouraging viewers to engage with important issues. Everyone\u0027s going to have their own opinion - it is what it is. The fact that we can give everyone a little friendly, entertaining reminder of these issues is great, he said.Last month, Coronation Street actress Julie Hesmondhalgh described the idea that the programme was becoming too politically correct as “such a load of b******s” ahead of a guest appearance on the show. A New Year\u0027s Day, rather than Christmas, special of Doctor Who will air this year on January 1st. The full interview with Ms Gill and Mr Cole is available in Radio Times magazine out today.Brexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces showdown over legal advice on Brussels dealWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?What is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Revealed: The Brexit legal advice that could see Britain trapped in customs backstopStory of the Calais Jungle reaches New York after refugee actors overcome Trump travel banComment: Poor Angela Merkel - at Christmas time we all know the awkward horror of forgetting a colleague\u0026#39s nameNorth Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39pink lady\u0026#39 off air as state TV revamped with younger facesComment: Norway-plus will satisfy most of our Brexit goalsThrift chic pushes Prince Charles up GQ best dressed listWoman killed on train \u0026#39may have put head out of window\u0026#39British couple thank New York police for finding ring after fumbled proposalUN plane to evacuate wounded Houthi rebels from Yemen ahead of peace talks\u0026#39It\u0026#39s real me\u0026#39: Nigerian president denies being replaced by cloneMichelle Obama tells Meghan Markle: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be in a hurry\u0026#39 to launch ambitious projectsNicola Sturgeon urges MPs to seek Article 50 extension and rule out a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitDynasties: Brutal scene in Painted Wolves episode made director illA \u0026#39generation of innovators\u0026#39 has been appointed to run the military in a shake-up of the top ranks of the Army, Navy and RAFMI6 chief calls for new era of spying using AI and robots to combat rogue statesSecret relationship between \u0026#39Virgin Queen\u0026#39 Elizabeth and French ambassador revealedSpain reels as far-Right Vox party storms into Andalucian parliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/03/TELEMMGLPICT000139158162_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqo88ejKHDTk6bXkPFMAlXN-ron8IBUshqjQMdC8kQN40.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"north koreas pink lady air state tv revamped younger faces","story":"Ri Chun-hee announces the successful test of a hydrogen bombThe melodramatic appearances of North Korea’s most famous television broadcaster may soon be consigned to the past as the regime’s state-controlled channel, KCTV, undergoes a modern makeover. Ri Chun-hee, 75, dubbed the “pink lady” after her distinctive pink traditional Hanbok dress, has been the face of the pariah state for decades, entrusted to announce its most historical developments, including key nuclear tests and the deaths of leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-il, during which she openly wept. But Ms Ri’s wavering, passionate tones appear to no longer fit with the high-tech image the country’s young leader Kim Jong-un, who is still in his 30s, wants to project. In keeping with his pursuit of modernisation – alongside the development of online shopping and a Netflix-style streaming app for indigenous smartphones – KCTV is reportedly undergoing a revamp, introducing younger, trendier reporters and a flashier, better-equipped studio. Ms Ri, known for both her exuberant support for the Kim family dynasty and occasional vitriolic outbursts at the West, has been seen less on state TV, although this is also attributed to her semi-retirement. According to a report in ABC news, a younger generation of anchors, dressed in neon suits, has ditched traditional, authoritarian reporting styles to find more modern, conversational ways to tell stories and engage their audience. The main motto of Kim Jong-un’s new era is to catch up with the new century and its trends. We could say that change in direction has been reflected on to programme productions, Kang Dong-wan, a professor at Dong-A University in Seoul, told the news channel. As North Korean viewers become more exposed to outside television programmes, the old top-down style of reading news does not sink in anymore,” Mr Kang explained. Kim Jong-un, pictured in a fur-lined coat inspecting a frozen fish factory, is trying to modernise his countryInstead, programming has switched from pure ideology about the achievements of the country’s “great leaders” to include more field reporting and ersity, focussing on improvements in living standards such as students on their mobile phones or restaurant customers enjoying pizza. TV shows are remaining on message, however. While they may include soundbites from regular citizens, interviewees are still certain to express their gratitude at every opportunity to Kim Jong-un.  Please review our commenting policyBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces showdown over legal advice on Brussels dealWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?What is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Doctor Who stars reject claim the show has become too PC Revealed: The Brexit legal advice that could see Britain trapped in customs backstopStory of the Calais Jungle reaches New York after refugee actors overcome Trump travel banComment: Poor Angela Merkel - at Christmas time we all know the awkward horror of forgetting a colleague\u0026#39s nameComment: Norway-plus will satisfy most of our Brexit goalsThrift chic pushes Prince Charles up GQ best dressed listWoman killed on train \u0026#39may have put head out of window\u0026#39British couple thank New York police for finding ring after fumbled proposalUN plane to evacuate wounded Houthi rebels from Yemen ahead of peace talks\u0026#39It\u0026#39s real me\u0026#39: Nigerian president denies being replaced by cloneMichelle Obama tells Meghan Markle: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be in a hurry\u0026#39 to launch ambitious projectsNicola Sturgeon urges MPs to seek Article 50 extension and rule out a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitDynasties: Brutal scene in Painted Wolves episode made director illA \u0026#39generation of innovators\u0026#39 has been appointed to run the military in a shake-up of the top ranks of the Army, Navy and RAFMI6 chief calls for new era of spying using AI and robots to combat rogue statesSecret relationship between \u0026#39Virgin Queen\u0026#39 Elizabeth and French ambassador revealedSpain reels as far-Right Vox party storms into Andalucian parliamentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 3 december 2018","story":"People dressed as Santa Claus take part in the 9th edition of the Santa Claus \u0027Papa Noel\u0027 rally in Turin, Italy.\u0026#39Crazy Rich Asians\u0026#39 flops in China box office debutBrexit deal latest news: Theresa May faces showdown over legal advice on Brussels dealWhat is the Brexit deal, and what will happen after Parliament votes?What is the Brexit backstop, and how might it bring down the British Government?Doctor Who stars reject claim the show has become too PC Story of the Calais Jungle reaches New York after refugee actors overcome Trump travel banComment: Poor Angela Merkel - at Christmas time we all know the awkward horror of forgetting a colleague\u0026#39s nameNorth Korea\u0026#39s \u0026#39pink lady\u0026#39 off air as state TV revamped with younger facesComment: Norway-plus will satisfy most of our Brexit goalsThrift chic pushes Prince Charles up GQ best dressed listRevealed: The Brexit legal advice that could see Britain trapped in customs backstopWoman killed on train \u0026#39may have put head out of window\u0026#39British couple thank New York police for finding ring after fumbled proposalUN plane to evacuate wounded Houthi rebels from Yemen ahead of peace talks\u0026#39It\u0026#39s real me\u0026#39: Nigerian president denies being replaced by cloneMichelle Obama tells Meghan Markle: \u0026#39Don\u0026#39t be in a hurry\u0026#39 to launch ambitious projectsNicola Sturgeon urges MPs to seek Article 50 extension and rule out a \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 BrexitDynasties: Brutal scene in Painted Wolves episode made director illA \u0026#39generation of innovators\u0026#39 has been appointed to run the military in a shake-up of the top ranks of the Army, Navy and RAFMI6 chief calls for new era of spying using AI and robots to combat rogue statesSecret relationship between \u0026#39Virgin Queen\u0026#39 Elizabeth and French ambassador revealedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/16/19/carlsberg.jpg","title":"beer sales boost pubs world cup hot summer england football bbpa","story":"IM Subscribe  registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

England’s success at the World Cup and good weather undoubtedly helped.“The chancellor’s\u0026nbspdecision in the Budget to freeze beer tax and lower business rates for thousands of pubs will make a huge difference to the viability of the sector moving forward, but Brexit looms large though, and brewers and publicans alike need certainty.”He added: “Clarity on the transition period from 29 March onwards, and a strong steer on the future relationship with the EU, would be a boost to the trade and beer sales. A no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On a weekday, when thousands of commuters were trying to get to work, college and school let alone the other, vast number of folk who thought they they would see the railway as their most convenient form of travel.Because it was in the North, the stoppage raised barely a glimmer of interest in the South. If it had happened in Kent or Surrey, to trains into London Bridge or Waterloo, all hell would have broken loose. Instead, it was just another day of misery, to go with the other numerous days lost, including when they changed the timetable, and the services across the North could not cope.Meanwhile, the Government is pressing ahead with a £56bn plan to develop HS2. Will the new high-speed link between London and the North-West change any of this? Will it improve things? Not at all. Will it make a difference that justifies such vast expenditure? Hardly. Is it a grotesque example of ministerial machismo, of gesture politics, of a total inability to see the wood for the trees? You bet it is.Archaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeNow we know HS2 really is a flawed projectHS2 requires extra £43bn \u0027for people to make the most of it\u0027The trains I’m talking about, the ones that were cancelled, were mostly on the branch lines, on the routes that people use day in, day out - not the West Coast Line, which already has a fast, comfortable service. In my lifetime, since growing up in Cumbria, and travelling to and from London to visit family, journey times have plummeted. On the main, trunk route - not on the secondary ones. This is where the problem lies, where the service is creaking.Cutting several minutes off the London to Manchester service does not matter a h’apporth. What would boost the experience immeasurably there would be to ensure that wifi works all the way, that a mobile signal is not lost. But that, too, is not what HS2 is about.Already, there is talk by those on the inside that the projected costs are soaring. The “main works civil contracts” on the London to Birmingham section, reports The Sunday Times, are “several billion pounds” over the official budget of £6.6bn. That’s before any earth is turned, and all manner of unseen, below ground problems are discovered.Conscious of a final bill that could spiral out of control, and being seen to get a grip, ministers are demanding that instead of sanctioning extra expenditure, costs are being renegotiated, to stick to the budgeted figure. This, in turn, has led to delays, as more design and development is required, and specifications redrawn. Again, the word is that the vast project - the country’s biggest and most demanding infrastructure scheme - is likely to be more than a year behind schedule.That\u0027s how fast HS2\u0026nbspservices will travel at when the project is completedPart of the issue here is that mooted figures are proving inaccurate, the result, apparently of an insistence that the new railway meets a deadline for the beginning of services, of 2026.The thinking behind this demand, that Britain is sick and tired of major capital constructions that seem to take forever to reach fulfilment (runway expansion of Heathrow was first raised exactly 50 years ago) is laudable. But put that together with a scheme that is huge and complex, and it can become a recipe for chaos. And that’s without HS2 being unnecessary in the first place.This is what ministers should realise: that £56bn buys you an awful lot of terribly needed enhancements, for instance to existing country and suburban services, and to digitalisation.There is a subtext, of course, to HS2 - one that is hardly ever raised, let alone publicly admitted. And it is that the 250mph railway has another purpose, beyond rushing passengers from London to Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. It is that the faster railway makes commuting from Birmingham in particular all that more manageable. House prices in the West Midlands are so much cheaper than in the South-East. Public sector workers in essential occupations, in sectors like the NHS and education, will be able to afford to commute from Brum. HS2, you see, is aimed in part at alleviating London’s growing housing crisis. Which makes it a very expensive solution indeed.When confronted with the news of the overruns and delay, the Department for Transport said it would not comment on speculation. “Our priority is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.”Yes, but does the overall project seriously provide value for money?Ministers have the ability to stop it in its tracks, to ert the investment elsewhere. Of course, that would involve a loss of pride. There would be some dismay in the North, but not as much as might be expected - particularly if the money was spent on other local, much-needed advancements. Perhaps they should test attitudes towards the new service before it\u0027s too late.For there are warning lights flashing all over this. An awful lot of cash is being committed to something for which there is little demand. Getting from A to B may become quicker, but B to C will be just as slow –\u0026nbspand it’s the B to C that is used by so many people every day, that ceased to operate last week and will do so again, even with HS2.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Regulated fares, meanwhile,\u0026nbspare linked to\u0026nbspretail price index\u0026nbspinflation and will rise by 3.2 per cent, as has previously been announced.Regardless of whether they buy regulated or unregulated tickets, the lot of users is not a happy one. They pay through the nose for\u0026nbspa shabby service prone to widespread disruption.\u0026nbspThese trains are affected by the Northern Rail strike this SaturdayA wake up call for rail operators? Commuters now have an ombudsmanThe near meltdown that followed the introduction of new timetables earlier this year brought\u0026nbsppublicity to the problem. But just as serious is the constant low-level pain inflicted upon passengers. No wonder the announcement left them, and their representatives, spitting tacks.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is the government’s policy of having taxpayers spend less subsidising the railways, with the\u0026nbspburden being shifted on to the fare-paying public. \u0026nbspAt first blush, that would seem like a credible plan, and even more so when you look at the numbers.\u0026nbspAccording to Full Fact, the fact checking charity, the railways have received subsidies averaging about £5bn a year over the last five years.\u0026nbspBut that’s just the start of it when it comes to public money. In 2016-17 about £15bn was spent in total, partly due to the way Network Rail, which owns and operates the tracks and infrastructure, is funded.\u0026nbspWanda Wyporska\u0026nbspof the Equality Trust\u0026nbspmade the point in  last year that this spending is weighted disproportionately towards London and the southeast, and so favours well-to-do commuters. She argued that the government should focus\u0026nbspon poorer areas\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsptransport used by the less well-off, such as buses and trams. She made a good point.\u0026nbspHowever, I would argue that one needs to look at rail in the context of an integrated transport policy that serves the needs of the nation, and its economy, as a whole.\u0026nbspRail, which has seen a sharp increase in passenger numbers and requires investment to cope with them, plays an important role in keeping people off Britain’s congested, polluting roads. Through that lens, the money is\u0026nbspwell spent.None of this changes the fact that the private rail operators have done a rotten job. Given what they’ve experienced, and what they pay for it, passengers’ outrage is entirely justified.\u0026nbspAt times like this, rail companies are fond of pointing out that 98p out of every £1 in fares goes into running the railways and that the extra money is needed to keep the show on the road.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

William Cook catches\u0026nbspup with him in his Bristol studioClick to followThe IndependentKnees up at Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge, in Ashton-Under-Lyne: these lodges had a dismal reputation, seemingly designed for taking the quickest route to oblivionAt Manchester Art Gallery, in the beating heart of England’s most happening city (sorry, London – you’ve had your turn), Martin Parr is showing a gaggle of reporters around his latest exhibition. It’s called Return to Manchester, and the title is telling. Parr is a southern softy, born and raised in Surrey, but it was as a photography student at Manchester Polytechnic in the early 1970s that he found his creative focus. His first exhibition, back in 1971, was just down the road, in a corridor at Kendal Milne department store. Half a century later he’s back in the metropolis that made him, to open a one man show of Mancunian photos, then and now.It’s an exhibition of two halves: black and white photographs of the rundown Manchester of the 1970s colour photos of the dynamic Manchester of today. Wry and playful, yet imbued with a deep, unspoken sense of melancholy, it’s a profound and powerful evocation of the way that Manchester – and Martin Parr – has changed. “I had a fantastic time in Manchester,”\u0026nbsphe says, and his affection for the city – then and now – is evident in these photos.Picture of heart-shaped cancer cells wins science photography prizeThe earliest photographs in the show were taken while he was still at college, and the images that encapsulate\u0026nbspthe Manchester of the early 1970s are the June Street photos he took with his friend and fellow student, Daniel Meadows. They’d gone in search of Coronation Street, but the street which inspired the Salford soap opera had already been demolished. However, a few scenes had been shot on June Street, an adjacent street which had survived.Instead of photographing the drab exteriors of these terraced houses, they ventured within. Their portraits of the people they found inside exude the poise and dignity of Old Masters, which is ironic, for Parr has often been accused of being a photographer who takes the piss. “Unless there’s some vulnerability there, I don’t think you’re going to get good photographs,” he once said. There’s vulnerability here aplenty, and that’s what makes these portraits so appealing.June Street was one of several photographic projects which Parr undertook, entirely of his own accord, during his student days in Manchester. A series of photos inside Prestwich Mental Hospital captured the bleak ambience of that institution, but it was his Love Cubes series (which doubled as a board game) that epitomised his sense of fun. Parr photographed couples on the streets of Manchester, together and then separately. The idea of the game is to try and work out who’s going out with whom.Half a lifetime later these student projects still feel fresh and vital, but Parr’s course was a vocational training for a career as a commercial photographer, and so his superiors weren’t impressed. He could have been chucked out if it hadn’t been for Alan Murgatroyd, the one tutor who fought his corner. Happily, after all these years, Murgatroyd is still with us, and he appeared as the guest of honour\u0026nbspto open Parr’s new show.For this show Parr has returned to Manchester to shoot a new set of photographs, and the city of today feels a world away from the city of his student days. It’s multicultural and, above all, colourful –\u0026nbspfrom Media City to the Eithad, from mosques to yoga classes, from royal wedding street parties to Gay Pride. It was unimaginable, 30 or 40 years ago, that Pride would have such a big impact in a city like Manchester,\u0026nbsphe says. From pies at Bury market to gluten-free brownies in the Northern Quarter, like an anthropologist Parr finds signs of change amid the ephemeral and the mundane.Created with Sketch.The best of The

Day, 2000, by Tom PilstonAlbanians in Korce, 1990, by Barry LewisHas any British city changed more than Manchester since Parr arrived here in 1970? I doubt it. But the rest of Britain has changed almost as much, and Parr has chronicled that change with more wit and insight than any other artist I know. What makes his vision so acute? To try and find out, I travelled to Bristol, where he’s lived since 1987, to meet this elusive and enigmatic man who excels at examining the minutiae of our daily lives.We meet at his studio, on an industrial estate on the scruffy side of Bristol. His studio is tidy and businesslike (not for him the chaotic squalor of the tortured, tormented artist). His appearance is similarly anodyne, almost anonymous – nondescript leisurewear, neither smart nor scruffy. His manner is friendly but noncommittal – warm smile, wary eyes. He speaks quietly, clearly, lucidly. His voice is classless, rootless. He chooses his words with care.“I was fully aware that Manchester had changed enormously in the 35 years since I lived there,”\u0026nbsphe says. “There are now two Manchesters – there’s the traditional one and the gentrified one, so I went to both.”He’s broadly enthusiastic about the gentrification of the city, but he can see the downside too. “Gentrification can be a mixed blessing. It can tend to kill off the sense of community that was there before – richer, younger people move in – but in the end I think without it these places would suffer even more.”As befits a born observer, accustomed to travelling incognito, he’s used to blending into the background. With his pleasant but forgettable face, his neat grey hair and his bland chainstore clothes, he’d make a good private detective. He looks more like a middle ranking civil servant than a famous photographer - which is fitting, for that was his father’s job (though his passion was ornithology). Martin used to accompany him on his birdwatching trips - though Martin always used to watch the birdwatchers, not the birds.He was born in 1952 in Epsom, the buckle in the commuter belt. His parents were Methodists (“I went to Sunday School and argued with the teachers”), comfortably off, in a humdrum way, and reasonably contented. He has one sibling, a sister, seven years younger, which made him almost an only child. It sounds like a barren beginning for a creative artist, but the absence of high drama compelled him to look more closely, more keenly, at the world around him. “The advantage of coming from suburban Surrey is that everywhere else looks more interesting.”\u0026nbspHe was a meticulous collector, and a quintessential trainspotter. He still collects all sorts of trash-aesthetic bric-a-brac today.His main inspiration was his paternal grandfather, George Parr, a lay preacher and a keen amateur photographer, who lived in Calverley, in West Yorkshire. George taught him the rudiments of photography. For Martin, it was love at first sight. “There was never any doubt. As soon as I saw it, I thought ‘That’s the medium for me – that’s what I want to be.’”\u0026nbspMartin’s summer holidays in Calverley were among his happiest childhood memories. ‘I’ve always had a soft spot for Yorkshire – my father’s from Yorkshire, I’ve got Yorkshire in my blood.’ His first photographic project was a study of Harry Ramsden’s, the celebrated Yorkshire fish and chip shop. It was here that his passion for photography – and the north of England – began.Martin passed his 11-plus and went to Surbiton Grammar School, but compared with his Yorkshire apprenticeship school was distinctly uninspiring. He was a mediocre student and his teachers were underwhelmed. His school report makes interesting (and, in retrospect, amusing) reading. ‘He has considerable flair for photography and a certain amount of ability in the art field, but there seems to be little chance of realising his potential if his attitude to his general work continues to be so poor,’ wrote his form tutor. “Very little work achieved – very lackadaisical,”\u0026nbspconcurred his art master.It was only when he went to Manchester that he really spread his wings. In Manchester he encountered a sense of community more akin to the one he’d found in Calverley. “Coming from suburban Surrey, I was very taken with that – the friendliness of people, and how open they were.”He lived in Moss Side, which was thrilling. When they started demolishing Moss Side we used to go round and pick the stuff out of the old houses and photograph it – we had a great time. Photography was his calling. Despite being on a course which didn’t suit him, making work for which there was no real outlet, he never doubted his abilities. I knew what I wanted to do and why, and I just got on with it. I had total self-belief.In Manchester he met Susie Mitchell, an English student from the Home Counties who collaborated with him on various projects and subsequently became his wife. In the 1970s, Manchester was an exciting place to live, like a foreign country after the outer London suburbs, she wrote, in her eloquent introduction to The Non-conformists, his haunting book of photos of Yorkshire chapel life. Swathes of condemned terraced housing, monstrous Victorian public buildings, acres of wasteland awaiting redevelopment, grimy parks and odiferous curry houses…\u0026nbspFor Martin it was paradise.After graduating from Manchester they moved to Hebden Bridge, where they formed close relationships with some of the subjects of The Non-conformists (Susie interviewed them Martin photographed them). This intimacy resulted in some remarkable photos, but the relationship ended rather unhappily when some of their subjects realised, belatedly, that they were only photographic subjects (rather than soulmates) after all.I wasn’t a believer,\u0026nbspsays Parr. I respected their religion and I enjoyed partaking in it and photographing it.\u0026nbspHowever, he was essentially an atheist. From then on Martin kept his distance and his work became more detached. You’re never part of what you photograph,\u0026nbsphe says. You’re always an outsider.Susie became a speech therapist, a job that took her to Ireland and then to Merseyside. Martin went with her and on Merseyside he found the subject that made his name. His stark photos of New Brighton (a rundown seaside resort near Liverpool) were revolutionary. For one thing, they were in colour (a medium still shunned by so-called “serious”\u0026nbspphotographers) but above all it was his stark treatment of these Liverpudlian daytrippers which broke new ground.Parr showed New Brighton in all its gory glory – the fractious toddlers, the bored parents, the litter, the fast food... There was nothing falsified about it, but there was nothing prettified about it either, and for middle class audiences used to quaint depictions of the worthy poor, it was a rude awakening. This is a clammy, claustrophobic nightmare world where people lie knee deep in chip papers, swim in polluted black pools and stare at a bleak horizon of urban dereliction,\u0026nbspwrote Robert Morris in the British Journal of Photography. Parr called his series The Last Resort.The show was well received in Liverpool. Ironically, it was when it went to London that the reaction became more critical. Our historic working class, normally dealt with generously by documentary photographers, becomes a sitting duck for a more sophisticated audience,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwrote David Lee\u0026nbspin Art Review. They appear fat, simple, styleless, tediously conformist and unable to assert any inidual identity. They wear cheap flashy clothes and in true conservative fashion are resigned to their meagre lot. Only babies and children survive ridicule, and it is their inclusion in many pictures which gives Parr’s acerbic vision of hopelessness its poetic touch.With the hindsight of history, this seems rather unfair. Parr’s vision is acerbic but he never ridicules his subjects. On the contrary, his day-trippers actually seem rather admirable, striving to give their children a nice day out in the face of overwhelming odds. Merseyside was a pretty hopeless place in 1986. Like all good photographers, Parr was simply shooting what he saw.I don’t think I’m out there to take the piss, particularly. There has to be a sense of mischief, because that’s part of the British make-up and identity, but the mischief is applied equally to everything and anybody, because life is weird. People are strange, and people are entertaining. I do like people –\u0026nbspI love what they all get up to.’Most of the things he photographs are things he does himself.‘Portrait of Britain’ photo competition highlights ersity of nationFive tips for underwater filming and photographyStanley Kubrick\u0027s unseen photography reveals early talent of directorHe’s impervious to criticism of his work. I realised pretty early on that that controversial aspect to what I do never does you any harm,\u0026nbsphe says. I’m very democratic when it comes to classes – I put it up all classes.\u0026nbspHe followed up The Last Resort with several projects about the bourgeoisie.If anything, these projects were even more acerbic, attracting further criticism. One picture editor called him a gratuitously cruel social critic who has made a large amount of money by sneering at the foibles and pretentions of other people.\u0026nbspAgain, this seems unfair. It’s hardly Parr’s fault that he’s made a decent living, and it seems harsh to describe his stance as sneering. He delights in bathos and absurdity, but his vision is dispassionate, not cruel. I continue to be amazed that people still find my work controversial, because I’m just photographing western life, the leisure pursuits of the western world.One of his most successful series, Small World, was about mass tourism, a phenomenon which straddles every class. We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite different. I’m showing the reality of peoples’ expectations.We have this idea of what a place would be like because we’ve seen it in the pictures and the postcards. When we get there the reality is quite differentAs beauty spots become tourist traps, that reality is pretty grim – but for Parr, it makes great photos. “I find it completely fascinating. Remember: when a place is mobbed I’m happy, because I can make my point even clearer.”\u0026nbspAnd the point is? “That the mythology is different to the reality.”The overall conclusion one draws from Parr’s photos is that consumerism is pretty tawdry, and globalisation is making a bad situation even worse. And yet, inidually, his photos are full of fun. “That’s all part of the contradiction – the ambiguity is what this is all about.”Back in Manchester, Martin is winding up his tour. Most of the pictures I take are rubbish – I take more rubbish than most people because I take more photographs than most people, he says. What you’re trying to find is that magic moment, and how and when that happens is almost impossible to predict. So, even though I’ve been doing it for many years, I couldn’t quite tell you how to do it – but you have a very strong intuitive sense when it starts to happen.Martin Parr: Return to Manchester is at Manchester Art Gallery (www.manchesterartgallery.org) until 22 April 2019Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts1730 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang. This is our ultimate goal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And these are exceptional circumstances.Labour sources said that Sir Keir was ready to sign a joint letter with the DUP\u0027s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake and SNP Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins, asking Mr Bercow to allow a motion that the government had\u0026nbspheld Parliament in contempt.Under Commons rules, if the Speaker allows the motion to go before the House and the vote is carried, it would then be referred to the Committee of Privileges which would rule on whether a contempt of Parliament had taken place.If it is decided that a contempt had occurred, the committee can recommend a suitable punishment which is then put back to MPs to agree.In theory, the most severe penalty is expulsion from the House, although the prospects of that happening would appear remote.However, any finding against the government would be potentially highly damaging for Ms May at a time when she is at her most vulnerable politically.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He accepted, the spokesman said.Since then, in order to accommodate his confected demands, we\u0027ve moved our preferred day, accommodated the addition of social media questions at Labour\u0027s request, and agreed there should be maximum head-to-head time, while still including voices from employers and civil society in the debate.But if Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u0027t agree to what\u0027s now on the table –\u0026nbspa debate on prime time with the prime minister –\u0026nbspthe public will rightly conclude he\u0027s running scared. So let\u0027s get on with it.Labour hit back, arguing that it was the prime minister trying to avoid the confrontation.As she did during the general election campaign, Theresa May is running away from the scrutiny of a real head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn, a spokesman said.Why else would she not accept ITV\u0027s offer of a straightforward head-to-head debate, as Jeremy has done?Created with Sketch.

Just 10 per cent said they thought the deal would produce a stronger economy while 22 per cent said “about the same” and 18 per cent replied, “don’t know”.\u0026nbspThe poll of 1,655 iniduals was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday, meaning some of those surveyed could have seen the alarming analysis of different Brexit scenarios from both the Treasury and the Bank of England.Outlining worst-case scenarios, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank, said a no-deal scenario could send the pound plunging, shrink the economy by eight per cent and that house prices could fall by almost a third.Referring to the findings, Mr Kellner added: “These are significant results, and not just because Remain’s lead is the biggest yet. For the first time, more than one in five Leave voters are having second thoughts.\u0026nbspwouldn’t be a ‘walk in the park’“While 88 per cent of those who voted Remain two years ago would vote the same way in a new referendum, the equivalent figure for Leave is down to 79 per cent.“This means that 3.5 million\u0026nbspLeave voters are having second thoughts – of whom two\u0026nbspmillion\u0026nbsphave changed sides and would now vote Remain. (The rest\u0026nbspare now don’t knows or would not vote).“The big majorities among Labour voters both for Remain and a People’s Vote also send a clear message to the party’s MPs about the decisions they will shortly face in parliament.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Competitors take part in the London Santa Run in London\u0027s Victoria ParkBritain will no longer have access to the EU\u0027s Galileo satellite system (pictured) following brexit US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May attend the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaWaves hit the British coast as Storm Diana approaches, in Portreath, CornwallDuke and Duchess of Cambridge stand with Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha (left), the son of Leicester City\u0027s chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and his mother Aimon watched by Leicester City players (right) as they pause after laying flowers during their visit to the King Power Stadium in Leicester, to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the October 27 helicopter crash at the stadium.

More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year.

but the EU has warned that would render the mechanism pointless.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.On November , thereported that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab demanded the right to pull Britain out of the EU’s Irish backstop after just three months.The paper claimed the hardline pitch to the Irish government “stunned” officials.Its claimed Mr Raab’s proposal was put to the Irelands deputy prime minister Simon Coveney in a private meeting in London.However, the Irish Prime Minister told Theresa May that he will not accept a Brexit deal which gives the UK the unilateral power to halt backstop arrangements for the border with Northern Ireland.The EU has suggested a backstop that would see Northern Ireland staying in the customs union, the EU VAT system and parts of the single market.This will essentially draw a customs border down the middle of the Irish Sea, potentially damaging the union of the UK.Mrs May has suggested a backstop that will see all of the UK aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after .Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU thinks this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.In June  European leaders said Britain was running out of time to do a deal because of the unsolved border problem.In July Theresa May quoted Shakespeare as she insisted the UK would not be broken up with a border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May has told EU leaders she is looking at ways of keeping Britain under their rules for at least another year as part of efforts to break the Brexit deadlock.Addressing the  national bosses at a tense summit in Brussels on the night of October , the PM said she is “ready to consider” extending the  month transition period after the UK leaves the EU next March.The potentially incendiary move has been drawn up by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier to try to end a bitter impasse over the Irish border.It would mean abiding by all Brussels rules until December  at the earliest.The news comes after talks on Sunday, October , hit a brick wall once again, as the issue of the Irish border continues to cause a headache for Theresa May.Theresa May has insisted any backstop arrangement must apply to the UK as a whole so not to create a border in the Irish Sea.However, talks broke down after the EU had insisted on a second backstop arrangement - just involving Northern Ireland -the UKs version wasnt ready in time, according to Downing Street sources.Brussels admitted in a draft trade agreement that technology COULD be used to solve the thorny issue of the border, using Max Fac solutions at the frontier as part of a future deal between the UK and EU.But the backstop - which keeps Britain in the customs unionno alternative is agreed to keep the Irish border open - will stay in the withdrawal agreement as an insurance policy.Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: The withdrawal agreement will make it very clear that should we struggle with a negotiation for a free trade arrangement and not complete that process, we will fall into the Northern Ireland backstop.I would hope that she would now consider that none of this is at all workable unless we get the withdrawal agreement now amended so that any arrangements we make strip out that backstop.Former minister Owen Paterson added: As long as the backstop is in existence in a legally binding document, there is a danger that should talks fail the backstop becomes accepted.We would have the horror of falling into a customs union, the horror of having Northern Ireland separated from the rest of the United Kingdom.Mrs May dubbed the continuing row with Brussels over how to avoid a hard border in Ireland as “the one real sticking point left, but a considerable one”.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.On November , , the PM faced crunch Cabinet showdowns with her ministers where she will set out the details of the agreement she struck with Brussels the previous day.A number of pro-Brexit ministers are feared to be on the brink of walking out over the deal.They believe it would leave Britain tied to the EU customs union for years to come, because of the controversial Irish backstop arrangement.If the Cabinet does block Mrs Mays deal, she could find her position is untenable - leading to a Tory leadership crisis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0003730276661-e1541888658682.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labour mp lives in social housing","story":"Shadow development secretary Kate Osamor has faced intense criticism after it emerged that she promoted her son in his House of Commons job, regardless of his conviction for having £, of Class A drugs with intent to supply at Bestival in Dorset last year.Now the Sun on Sunday can reveal that Ms Osamor and her son Ishmael, , are living in social housing in Tottenham, north London -

He is the Health Secretary, for God’s sake. Why doesn’t he get the medicines, instead of issuing stupid threats At least Michael Gove’s pitul descent into Project Fear ignominy, with his own Hancockian warning about running out of drinking water, turns out to be fake news — or so I’m told.And where has all this left us With a Brexit “deal” that is not really a deal and doesn’t actually deliver Brexit. The transition period leaves Britain subject to most EU rules, and there is no agreement on what comes next — just an agenda for more negotiations.How dare Mrs May say last Sunday, “The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal that fulfils the vote” Her plan guarantees years more “arguing about Brexit” and obviously doesn’t fulfil the vote. I know politicians spin everything but this is in a dferent league. It’s not spin, Prime Minister — what you are saying is a bare-faced lie, and you know it.It is also disgraceful that the civil service is helping push out this lying propaganda at taxpayers’ expense with its Cabinet Office “Project Vote” operation.But we shouldn’t be surprised. The senior civil service has catastrophically mishandled Brexit all along, finally exposing as self-serving fiction the idea that it is the professional, reliableof the national interest, there to save the nation from the half-baked schemes of here today, gone tomorrow politicians.Yes indeed: “Consider the possibility we are led by idiots.”But now what, you might say. It’s easy to criticise — what would you do Well, I’ve said it before : Pursuing a “deal” with the EU is a waste of time. Of course you can’t stay in the single market but regain control of immigration. Of course you can’t stop paying membership fees but still set the rules. And as President Trump noted, of course you can’t strike new trade deals unless you fully leave.There is no such thing as a “soft Brexit”. There is Brexit, without adjectives — or staying in the EU in some form. “Fulfilling the vote” now requires two things: Preparing for a clean break and counteracting the inevitable short-term disruption.Disgracefully, and cynically, the Government refused to prepare for a clean break over the past two years, so now we are behind. But that doesn’t mean we can’t do it — it just means an all-out effort must be made, andnecessary the exit date pushed back.However solid the preparations, though, there is bound to be economic turbulence. But here too, we can be proactive. The Government could almost instantly make Britain the world’s top destination for business and investment.Slash corporation tax and regulations. Roll out the red carpet for entrepreneurs, scientists, investors. Commit to building the world’s most modern infrastructure and best-trained workforce.Business hates uncertainty more than anything. That is why Theresa May’s deal is a disaster — it prolongs uncertainty.A clean break and a radical pro-enterprise agenda would end uncertainty and counteract the short-term shock of departure.Once we have left, and shown how dynamic post-Brexit Britain can be, we will have much more leverage to negotiate a trade deal with the EU.Objectors will say: This is fantasy — there is no majority in Parliament for a clean break. But there is no majority for anything  either, and in any case, with a clean-break scenario the EU Withdrawal Act does not require a vote that binds the Government.But perhaps the biggest question is: Who can make this happen My idea of bringing back Cameron went down like a lead balloon. After the Rees-Mogg rebellion flopped, we are stuck with Mrs May — evenshe loses on December . No one can see a way out.There is only one answer. Pro-Brexit MPs, inside and outside Cabinet, must develop a spine, step up and unite to offer a positive alternative. Unite to get rid of TheresaMay, then make the case with passion and conviction for a clean break and a radical pro-enterprise programme.Right now, Britain needs leaders. Not idiots.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004506571551-e1543531251522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn trying to ruin economy","story":"Just the threat of the lelong Marxist in Downing Street has seen huge amounts of cash leave the UK, and it could be just a taster.We don’t buy the ridiculous Project Fear sequel.But imagine the Bank’s apocalyptic scenario is anywhere half-close to true.Now imagine a Corbyn government committed to massive increases in corporation and income tax, a wealth windfall tax, and nationalising everything within touching distance.Even the Shadow Chancellor has said there’d be a run on the Pound.It’d make even the most chaotic clean break look a walk in the park.People think Venezuela-style destitution could never happen in Britain.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities.

All you need is ¼ cup of ACV,  tablespoon of cayenne pepper, freshly squeezed lemon juice , a tablespoon of honey and ½ cup of water.Simply boil the water, add the apple cider vinegar, and cook over medium heat. Then, add the lemon juice and honey to enrich the taste and add more beneficial compounds.Finally, add the cayenne pepper, stir well, and drink the remedy on a daily basis.Chief medical officer of US-based Epitomedical Constantine George said Apple cider vinegar contains B vitamins, like vitamin B, B, vitamin A, vitamin E, . . . magnesium, potassium, calcium.He added: From that perspective, these can help boost ones immune system, and that, therefore, can help fight off or prevent sinus infections.Imagine when you have an infection, allergies, runny nose, coughing, congestion, most of the time when you go to the doctors office, theyll tell you to take antihistamines like Zyrtec, Allegra, and Claritin to kind of help decongest you.Despite no personally prescribing the cider to his patients, the doctor said: Its about   [effectiveness] with the limited number of patients we do have who have tried it. Its a newer thing thats out there, and youre going to hear more and more about it as the years go on.Other doctors, however, have said taking simple multivitamin tablets can be more effective."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453338295.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"single mum builds lapland in her home","story":"Helen Sadler, , transformed the room in her home into a winter wonderland after five-year-old Erin was too sick to travel to Finland to see it in real le.The single mum-of-one used little Erins old medicine packets and syringe boxes to make an impressive fairy castle — all for just £. A polar bears cave and frozen lake for seals are made from papier-mâché, cardboard and glitter.And in pride of place is a snow queen wearing Helens mums old coat, sitting in a wooden sleigh made by Erins granddad Philip - pulled along by a fairy-light reindeer.Helen, a former NHS commissioning manager, said: When we finished it, Erin thought it was amazing and she said Nice job mum and gave me the thumbs up.She absolutely loves it.

This is about the kind of society we want to live in, the justice we want for each other. “It’s not right that during the last year we’ve seen soaring need for foodbanks across our network.  “It’s not right that this December, we’re expecting to see more emergency help needed than ever before. “And it’s not right that the benefits system we created to protect people from hunger is pushing people to our foodbanks.” She continued: “We want to reach a future where no one needs a foodbank, but we can’t get there alone. “That’s why we’re so grateful for the support of the Mirror in the lead-up to Christmas through the End Hunger, Feed a Family appeal. “Any support you can give will make a real dference. “We work with our foodbanks to provide emergency food, offer additional support and, crucially, campaign for long-term change. “Your donations will help ensure people in crisis right now can access the best possible support and bring us closer to a future where that help isn’t needed. “Rising foodbank use isn’t inevitable. We can end hunger and poverty. We’d love your support to reach a future where no one needs a foodbank.” People have to be referred to foodbanks by a professional such as a health visitor, school or social worker.  They are given a voucher that entitles them to a parcel, which contains enough nutritionally balanced, non-perishable food for three meals a day for three days. Many people are needing this help for the first time, such as Jodie Jennings and Rebecca Harrison, . The couple, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, are struggling to feed themselves and their six-month-old daughter. This is in part due to delays to jobseeker Rebecca’s benefit payments. Jodie, , said: “You feel so hopeless.” Volunteers at the Trust are expecting to dish out . million meals to starving families this Christmas. That is , more than last year. There was a % surge in demand at the Trust’s foodbanks last December compared with the rest of the year. The charity gave away , emergency parcels in the run-up to and over the festive period – a total of . million meals and a % increase from , when , parcels were handed out. Demand has already soared this year, with Trust experts blaming the UC rollout. Referrals caused by the five-week delay to payments have doubled in the last year, from % to %. The changes to benefits and delays are now the single biggest driver of people turning to the Trust for support. This is why we are urging readers to back our petition to stop the rollout of UC and replace it with a fair system. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: “The reasons for people using foodbanks are complex, and it would be wrong to link a rise to any one cause. “No one should have to face hardship with Universal Credit and we’ve made up to % advances available from day one. For families that need extra support, we are spending poundbillion a year on working-age welfare.” How you can help By text...

The -year-old says his situation is so bad that hes threatening to break the law to ensure his family survive. I am selling my belongings, thats how bad its got, he said. I am selling my belongings so my son can have a Christmas. I have had to sell my shoes tonight, the ones I walk out in. Im now down to my last pair of trainers, the ones on my feet. I sold my Animal trainers, the ones my partner bought me, so we can get stuff for Christmas. Its coming to the point where I may end up having to go stealing to get stuff for my family. I will be stealing and thieving to get my Christmas , because I am being treated like s***. So its time for society to be treated like s***.  The man says he was self-employed before signing off sick earlier this year with anxiety and depression. He was then advised to switch to Universal Credit to continue claiming cash for sick leave. Thats despite guidance issued by the Department for Work and Pensions stating statutory sick pay isnt part of Universal Credit. I went sick because my anxiety got worse, my depression and all that, he explained. I went on Universal Credit back in April I kept sending my sick notes inand Im still waiting on that money. I was told I had been fast-tracked, and yet Im still waiting.

Universal Credit some months paypound-, and sometimes pound, but that doesnt pay the rent, he said. We are cutting short the rent - because we have to survive and eat too. The system has let us down from day one - its absolutely rotten. Its dragged on for months waiting for full payment. Its not fair that we have to struggle as a family when the Universal Credit system isnt sorting itself out. Theyre not the one waiting eight months on their wages. The DWP says it is the responsibility of claimants to declare any change of circumstances to ensure they get they’re getting the right amount of benefit.

Dave Fletcher, , thought he had captured a tender childhood moment when he pictured daughter Izzy dozing off at a playground when she was -months-old. But just a few weeks later Dave and we Vicky, , were left devastated at the news their daughters tiredness was a symptom of leukaemia. Dave, an auditor, said he thought nothing of it when he snapped Izzy nodding off in the swing at a park near their home in Claines, Worcs. It was just an afternoon pop out to the swings. She was swinging away - I turned around and she had dropped off. She was drowsy and fell asleep but I didnt think much of it. I thought it was a cute moment and just took a picture of her as you do.  It was only afterwards we realised it was all part of the symptoms and what Id captured was her displaying signs of something more sinister, he said. The youngster has since undergone  doses of gruelling chemotherapy and is now receiving maintenance therapy in a bid to stop the cancer ing. Dad Dave is now warning other parents to be vigilant and look out for the tell-tale signs of the disease. She had been tired, had had a few colds or viruses, and quite a bit of bruising on her legs. But we put all this down to normal childhood bumps and minor illness. You get a bit sentimental, looking at pictures of her before she was ill - you just realise how much shes been through since at so young.  The couple first took Izzy to a GP in January last year after a strange rash appeared on her leg. They were advised to come back several days later for blood teststhe rash had not gone, and to take her straight to hospitalit got worse. However by the next morning, Izzys rash had spread and she then developed a temperature, so her parents took her to Worcester Royal Hospital. She was diagnosed with leukaemia the same day and began a course of chemotherapy the following week.Izzy spent her second birthday in Birmingham Childrens Hospital waiting to have a procedure to sample her bone marrow.  As part of her care, Izzy was enrolled on a clinical trial called UKALL  and will remain on treatment until May next year. This trial aims to seechanging the standard chemotherapy treatment will reduce side effects and help stop their disease from coming back. Dave added: She has grown up very quickly and been subjected to medicine she doesnt like but has taken everything in her stride so far. When she was diagnosed it came out of the blue. We were both in real shock as it happened so fast.It was a big unknown. A family member died of leukaemia five years ago, so it was a scary time. We didnt know what was going to happen at that stage or what the future held. But we were lucky Izzy was diagnosed quickly and lucky she has coped very well with the treatment, suffering very few setbacks or unplanned hospital admissions. The type of leukaemia she has has a better chance of recovery than some others. She is young which helps those odds. It makes us more optimistic. She doesnt have to have so many steroids because of the trial she is on.Its a treatment plan they use in other countries and we are grateful to be given the opportunity.It shows just how important research is in pioneering new treatments. The NHS doctors and nurses have been brilliant. and weve had lots of support from family and friends.  Brave Izzy has now received a Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens Star Award in recognition of what she has been through. Vicky, , an archivist, said: Izzy was so excited to receive her award. It was a nice positive experience that rewarded her for struggling on with her treatment. Jane Redman, spokesperson for Cancer Research UK Kids  Teens in Worcestershire, said: Cancer can have a devastating impact on their lives and many of those who survive may live with serious long-term side effects from their treatment.

An official prison watchdog report has revealed in June last year  Scottish prisoners were unlawfully at large in England, half the  total who had absconded after being liberated on Home Detention Curfewtags. It has been recommended that the practice be suspended until communication with authorities south of the Border are improved. The systems issues came to light following the murder of Craig McCelland in Paisley, the Daily Record reported.The dad-of-three was kned to death by James Wright, , who had avoided the law for six months after destroying his tag before carrying out the random attack.   The murder led the HM Inspectorate of Prisons for Scotlandto order a review of the system in July last year. It said: “Serious consideration should be given to temporarily suspending HDC releases outwith Scotland until a more rigorous communication protocol is developed between the Scottish Prison ServicePolice Scotland and the English authorities in relation to the monitoring and licence revocation process.” The SPS were forced to carry out an overhaul of their procedures. But rather than ending the practice of releasing prisoners to addresses in England, they have instead identied contacts in England and Wales’  police forces. The hope is that English officers will be able to track down offenders for them in areas wherePolice Scotland have no jurisdiction. An SPS response to the HMIPS recommendation added that information would be placed on the National Police Computer and Police Scotland notied of the breach of licence.   Moira Ramage, a former district procurator fiscal and Parole Board for Scotland member, believes Scottish prisoners shouldn’t be allowed to give addresses outside the country for home detention. She said: “A prisoner should have to provide an address in Scotland before being considered for a tag. “They should have to remain in an area where Scottish police can arrest themnecessary.” Neil Bibby MSP added: “Any loopholes in the Home Detention Curfew scheme that could put the public at risk must be closed and closed quickly. “After the tragic murder of Craig McClelland, confidence in HDCs has been badly shaken and the Scottish Government have a responsibility to act quickly and reassure the public.” Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr said: “It shouldn’t be dficult to sort this out, particularly when public safety on both sides of the Border is concerned. “Clearly police here and in England need to get their heads together to come up with a plan.”   Of the  prisoners unlawfully at large in England on June ,  were ed to custody before the HMIPS report was published in October. Notes in the final draft provided by the SPS claimed inquiries on five were pending, while three remained on the run. A small number were back in custody over separate matters. An SPS spokesman said: “Police Scotland don’t have jurisdiction in England but English forces do and they can act on the information that is forthcoming via the Police National Computer, as indeed they have in the past. “The HMIPS recommendation was that a more rigorous communication protocol be put in place and we have done that. The details are in the report.” He added that, over the last  months,  of  prisoners released on home detention had been allowed to go to England and that, in that period, eight who had absconded had been ed to custody. A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Police Scotland and the SPS have worked together to establish a single point of contact in all  police forces in England and Wales, with clear processes for alerting the relevant force and National Probation Service in the event of breach.” "},{"url":null,"title":"historian david starkey reveals moment","story":"NewsHistorian David Starkey reveals moment he found his partner dead on the sofaThe academic found his partner of  years, James Brown, dead on the sofa in ShareCommentsByElaine McCahill:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsDavid Starkey has spoken of the heart breaking moment he found his partner James Brown dead at their home \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDavid Starkey has spoken of the heart breaking moment he found his long-term partner dead at their home.

It is believed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend Christmas with the royals at Sandringham.Kate, William and their children, meanwhile, are reportedly planning to spend the festive season at the Middleton family mansion in Berkshire.There have been recent rumours of a rt between William, Harry and their wives.Meghan and Harry recently unveiled plans to move out of Kensington Palace - where the Cambridges also live - and set up home in Windsor instead.There are also recent reports of a ghastly row between Meghan and Kate, which sparked the current feud. Kates mum Carole confirmed in her first ever interview this weekend that she has planned a less formal Christmas day for her children and grandchildren, suggesting William, Kate, George, Charlotte and Louis will join them on December .Instead of following the strict schedule of a formal church visit and an extravagant lunch served up by the royal butlers, Caroles essentials are mince pies, mulled wine and mistletoe.  A royal aide reportedly said about the ghastly row that drove a wedge between the royal couples: Kate had a quiet word with Meghan. It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been told off. He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation. Prince Charles had engineered a get-together between the two couples at Kate and Williams country home after Meghan felt she didnt feel welcome with all members of the royal family.

Dad Robert was also again diagnosed with cancer in , shortly after Karl was told he was sick. But chose to keep his terminal diagnosis secret to save his family from more pain.

Dad died in March , only four months after mum. Days before Robert died he built his daughter this pink shed, as a place to take her mind away from the anxiety caused by her anorexia. Rob said: My dad built it for my sister and worked while he was poorly when he was first diagnosed with cancer. He built it as a hobby and craft shed to help her with her anxiety and depression.”  He added: “Every day he pushed himself to go out there, to do it, he wanted to make sure it was done in case the worst happened. He was a really devoted dad.” The constant stream of terrible news made Rebecca’s anorexia, anxiety and depression signicantly worse, to the point her brothers are worried she will make herself ill. Following their parents deaths le became almost intolerable for the siblings, they had no parents and both Karl and Robert were in the throes of rigorous treatment for their own diseases. Despite trying experimental treatment Karls cancer became progressively worse and by the age of  he was paraylsed. He died just a month before his th birthday, the same week brother Rob had a le saving liver transplant. Stuck miles away in hospital in Birmingham Rob could only whisper his goodbyes to Karl over the phone after he had passed away. Rob said: “It was extremely dficult, I’d had this amazing news, I was getting a second chance at le and my brother was passing away at the same time.” Rebecca added: It was really hard, heartbreaking. Rob hadnt wanted to leave but Karl knew Rob was going, he kept saying we are both going to get better.  Rob said:“It seems likewe weren’t getting bad news it was no news andwe didn’t have bad luck we’d have no luck at all.” The family had a speck of light amid all the darkness in their lives when youngest brother Ste got married and then when he had his daughter Matilda.

Sadly Robert and Karl never got to meet baby Matilda although the family say just knowing a bit of joy was coming into the family buoyed their spirits before they passed. Rebecca said: Mum and dad always wanted a grandchild and when Ste found out he was having a baby dad was excited. Karl was excited too. The family are terried they will be forced out of their beloved family home. Robert said: “This is the only house we’ve ever known.” After their parents died the siblings told the mortgage company of their dad’s death and continued to pay the mortgage to stay in the home. Rebecca said: The house means everything to us. People have asked: Why not let the house go  Its in negative equity. But we dont want to leave, I cant live anywhere , I can feel my mum and dad here. Rob was named on the account when his father became ill, however last December the mortgage company started refusing to take payments on the mortgage and insisted the house could be repossessed unless the full balance of the mortgage was repaid. A year later the siblings are fighting to keep the only home they have ever known, full of the only happy memories they have. Rob said: We had been making payments and then all of a sudden it stops. The thing is we were paying for it, weve tried to get mortgages even though they knew immediately dad died and it wasnt until December when they sent a letter to say the account holder had died.. The huge economic burden of paying for three funerals and taking legal advice have left the siblings financially crippled, meaning they now dont have hot water in their home. Rebecca said: We were paying out for three funerals and were told were not eligible forgrantsbecause Stephen is working. After visiting multiple solicitors the family said have been told they should be allowed to stay in the home but the mortgage company are still insisting it needs to go to court. Rebecca said: We went to see a solicitor , he said to us that legally they shouldnt have taken payments after the account holder passed, it should have just been into probate, so legally they took us on as tenants. The family have now been told they must pay the huge pound, balance on the mortgage or face court action on December . A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family with the crippling costs of paying off the funeral and to help them with general expenses. They said will take help in any form they can and are asking for legal advice, anyone who might be able to help with a mortgage or even someone to buy the home and let it back to them. The siblings fear that moving out of the house would also mean they were forced to be apart for the first time in their lives. Rebecca said: We dont want to have to ask people for money, its the last thing we wanted, its not something they [parents] would want us to do but they loved the house and I cant lose it. Ive been extremely down about it, I dont want to be split up. If the company said you can make payments tomorrow, we would go with that, we want to pay.

Thomas Markle told friends that his ex-we, Doria Ragland , should be the one to give Meghan away so it came as a huge surprise when Meghan released a statement revealing Prince Charles would be taking that honour. But giving what we now know about the reported rt between Meghan and Kate and the Duchess of Sussexs suggestion she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the royal family, Charles decision makes perfect sense. Could it be that Charles was simply trying to act as peacemaker between his two sons other halves and to make Meghan feel more part of the family  After all, months earlier he had attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham in a cunning bid to bring the couples together.  Meghan is said to have won over her -year-old father-in-law, who admires her work ethic and shares her interest in the arts. William then told his father what was happening, which prompted Charles to pay a visit and his best to jolly everyone along. But this sensationally backfired, according to sources, when Kate and Meghan had a ghastly row, according to Mail Online. ‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”. ‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’ By the week of the wedding the rumoured rt between Meghan and Kate had reached fever-pitch with Kate being reportedly reduced to tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte.   So when the unexpected new broke of Thomas Markle the -year-old was left with a gaping hole in her wedding party and a last minute decision to make. Hours later a palace statement read: Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the quire of St Georges Chapel on her wedding day. The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to the Royal Family in this way. Prince Harry later spoke of the moment he asked his father to walk his fianceacutee down the aisle.

The -year-old struck up a romance with the man after innocently accepting a friend request on Facebook. Their relationship blossomed and he sent a picture of himself, promising they would live together in the near future. Deborah Harmon, from Homosassa in Florida has been widowed for  years and has no surviving family.She told the Manchester Evening News how the con-artist sent her a picture of himself and a picture of his passport to persuade her he was real.She ended up wiring him , by Western Union, when the he told her he had arrived on business in South Africa but none of the ATMs would accept his bank cards.  More money was sent later and then, after he set up an account in her name, she was told she needed to deposit cash to activate it. She then sent him massive sums of money, first using up her le savings and later taking out loans to get more cash, believing they were building a future together.By the time she realised shed been had, she had handed over everything she had - and more, she says. The man told her he lived in a flat on Rochdale Road in Harpurhey although no-one by the name he gave appears there on the electoral roll. GMP and Action Fraud are now investigating after Deborah reached out to the Manchester Evening News. The M.E.N. found three separate Facebook accounts which bear the picture used to scam Deborah, raising suspicions the picture is someone other than the conman. The profiles iously claim the man pictured has studied at New Manchester High School, which doesnt exist, and Manchester High School, which is a girls school - and the links to the supposed schools connect to Facebook pages of institutions in America. Deborah says she has spoken out in a bid to stop anyone  falling for the scam. He was on my Facebook, she said. I accidentally pressed accept and we started chatting from there. He was saying that he felt that we were meant to be together and that it was destiny. He said he was a widower and that he had a son and that he was a contractor. We chatted on Facebook for maybe three months and then he invited me to talk to him onHangouts. We swapped numbers and he called me. He said he was in Manchester.  He told me he was on his way to do business in South Africa. He said hed inherited the business from Manchester. We would talk before he went to lunch and then in the evening after he had had a nap. We would speak every day. To me his accent sounded German. He spoke in broken English. He said he was madly in love with me and that we would definitely be together and that he knew I was the one for him. He wanted to have a family. He said he had a son and he wanted me to be a mother to his son. Askedshe reciprocated, Deborah said: I did. I do. I do have feelings for him but I cant trust him. Im very naive. I could kick myself. Her scammer set up what appeared to be an account at what is clearly a bogus bank purporting to be based in Budapest, Turkey, called Private Wealth Bank, sending her a statement when she had deposited some money which she was required to activate the account. In one email, an account officer at the bank wrote in pidgin English to Debora: We are doing all our best to assist you and to help Mr. Fred as well. We advise you to complies to the banking policy. We also do identy our bank each time you called or you are called. We are not running a charity organization in our bank. We are here to help you and to solve this problem once off.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13662436.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS168584632.jpg","title":"ayrshire sands mark 30 years","story":"NewsAyrshire SANDS mark  years of support and prepare for Christmas bauble serviceThe voluntary group has been offering an invaluable support network to bereaved parents across the county for three decades.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsSANDS team Marion Boyd, Jenner Stamp, Sarah Spiers and Alison McNeil \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThat they are needed at all is a matter of huge regret. But to those within Ayrshire SANDS, a common bond and desire to unite burns bright. Behind this voluntary group for bereaved parents lies many a heartbreaking story. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death organisation is there, in the first instance, to reach out to those in desperate pain. As a support network, mums and dads who have been in the darkest of places are often the very people best placed to act as rocks for those perishing behind them. But back in , when the Ayrshire branch of this inspiring group formed, few could have imagined the size of their task  years on. Local chair, Marion Boyd, explains: “Our first meeting had only a handful of parents and the whole topic of losing a baby was very taboo. “Thankfully the world has changed a lot since then, and people have become far more open about their loss. “But there’s no doubt that back then, you were not encouraged to speak about it.” For newly grieving mums like Marion, having a place to turn was not in the script of the s. And her experience – along with those of many others – has helped drive the st century changes to hospital support.  Marion, , said: “I had to share a room with another mum who had just given birth. “Watching her push her baby around and hear the cries of a newborn was heartbreaking. “But that was the reality back in those days. “It was almost like you had to dust yourself down and get back to normal as soon as possible. “Then there were the people who wouldn’t know what to say to you...so they’d maybe say nothing at all.” Marion and fellow committee members in the Ayrshire branch of the SANDS group are among Britain’s longest serving. Along with fellow parents, they have raised thousands during the intervening three decades and made friends through their grief. New facilities, latterly built at the Ayrshire maternity unit in Crosshouse, now give newly grieving parents their own space – with SANDS instrumental in their set-up. Treasurer Alison McNeil, , said: “Each of us has our own personal story which brought us together, and obviously they are very sad. “But through the years a special bond has grown between so many of the parents here. “Some of us have become friends for le and we’re just glad we can be here to offer support to others now. “But one stillbirth or neonatal death is one too many and it’s a sad reality that our group continues to grow like it does.” From the handful that began the journey in , so many more have passed through the hands of Ayrshire SANDS since then. And on Sunday, hundreds will attend the group’s annual bauble service at Prestwick’s St Nicholas Church. And such is the growing need for the team, they even have their own social media officer. Mum Sarah Speirs, , added: “The best thing is that nobody will judge you. “Ultimately, the only person who can truly understand what it’s like to lose a child is another parent who’s experienced the same thing.” And Marion said: “We were very keen from the outset that we had NHS involvement in the group. “We have an office on site at Crosshouse and work closely with midwives. “Perhaps they could have been wary of us at first, thinking that some parents would want to criticise them. “But they quickly realised that we are all here for the same thing and it’s a relationship that has worked very well. “Ideally the need for our group wouldn’t be there at all, but we’re just glad it can do some good.” •Parents wishing to attend Sunday’s service can bring their own bauble to hang on the Christmas tree.

Whilst providing a first-class service to her clients and the long hours spent in the office, Margo manages to achieve the perfect work-le balance for her family. This is one of the many reasons that she is one of just three finalists for Solicitor of the Year at the Law Awards of Scotland . The ceremony is this Thursdayat the Hilton in Glasgow. Growing up on the family farm in Maybole, Margo has been involved in agriculture since a young age and knew that her career path would lead her into the agricultural industry. Starting her legal career in the city, Margo worked at MacLay, Murray and Spens in Glasgow before moving closer to home at Howat’s Associates in Mauchline, to spend more time with her husband and two sons. Margo then moved to become a Partner at Lockharts in Ayr, and now heads up their Agricultural and Estates Team. Margo was nominated by one of her long-standing clients and will be attending the Awards. Her firm Lockharts are presently rebranding their office and operation at Beresford Terrace. Peter Lockhart told the Post: “The Partners and staff are proud of Margo. This is particularly so, given the two other finalists are high profile City Centre Lawyers. It’s the first time in the Firm’s  year history, any Partner has been nominated for such a prestigious national award. The fact she should be nominated by a satisfied client, adds to the accolade.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

After being promised wealth on buses, we face hardship on stilts. And after hammering warnings of No Deal to get her own way, Theresa May has invalidated No Deal by mistake.In the last week, wersquove seen the UK Government warning No Deal could lop % off GDP by  relative to our current economic trajectory. Security minister Ben Wallace said No Deal could put the country at greater risk of crime and terrorism. And Scottish Secretary David Mundell doubled down on his claim that No Deal would be ldquocatastrophic for the Union.So dire have been the worst-case scenarios that MPs have united to block No Deal. The apocalypse appears to have been cancelled.Mrs May also made the ldquonational interest her yardstick on Brexit. But in what circumstances would the national interest be best served by No Deal  How could she argue it would be in the national interest to enter recession, choke the ports, disrupt the food supply chain, upend industry, risk social unrest, and jeopardise her precious Union, as her own cabinet has warned She has killed off her bogeyman. Instead of No Deal warnings making it more likely MPs will back her deal, it has made them more likely to reject it, as they no longer feel a chaotic exit hanging over them.They now reckon they have more space to explore other options - a softer Norway-style Brexit with single market and customs union membership is the current favourite, or a Peoplersquos Vote, the option increasingly favoured by Labour.Some politicians point out that, although Mrs May and the EU say the current deal is the only one on offer, it is more accurate to say it is the only negotiated deal. That doesnrsquot mean itrsquos the only option. Off-the-shelf plans, such as EFTA membership, are out there too.Nicola Sturgeon always said it was a ldquo choice between Mrs Mayrsquos deal and No Deal, and Mrs May and cabinet have proved it. Brexit is rich with unintended consequences.Another unintended consequence applies to Ms Sturgeon. The First Minister recently announced her MPs would vote in favour of a Peoplersquos Votegiven the chance. It was not a universally popular idea.Pete Wishart, the longest serving SNP MP, warned it could work against the independence cause, setting a precedent that could see Unionists demand a re-run of a referendum ending in a Yes vote.Alex Salmond raised the same point on his TV show last month.Irsquom not sure about this argument. The SNP conceded the principle that referendums can be rerun as soon as it lost the  vote. ldquoThe dream shall never die, as Mr Salmond said in his resignation. Then Ms Sturgeon called a second referendum in March  over Brexit to reverse the No vote.The argument seems more about timing than principle about how long to wait before voters will put up with another referendum.But there is a more pressing aspect to Ms Sturgeon supporting a Peoplersquos Vote. If her MPs back it, they will be voting against another independence referendum. Not directly, of course. But the former would surely preclude the latter.Imagine the Prime Minister is defeated on December  and the upshot, after much wailing and gnashing of dentistry, is that MPs decide to palm the mess off onto you and me. Sorry, I mean trust the people to decide what to do next. This would not be a speedy process.The EU would have to agree to extend the Article  process by a year or more to put Brexit on ice. Another referendum means a bespoke Bill going through Westminster. The last one took seven months. A second referendum Bill would be resisted at every turn by apoplectic Brexiteers. There would be a furious debate about what would be on the ballot paper.Would it be a choice between Leave and Remain again  Or a multiple choice  Perhaps the UK governmentrsquos deal versus a dferent deal , staying in the EU or a sod-it No Deal.If it was first-past-the-post, the winner would almost certainly get less than the % that gave Leave victory in . Imagine the stink that would cause. If it was decided by proportional representation, transfers might see most peoplersquos second choice come out on top. That doesnrsquot sound like a recipe for clarity and contentment either.The Electoral Commission would need weeks to mull it over. There would then be another four months of campaigning, and a potentially long and messy aftermath.The process could be doubly confused by a Tory leadership contest and a winner shting the government position mid-stream.This would all take time, time Ms Sturgeon doesnrsquot haveshe wants a second referendum before her ldquocast-iron mandate runs out in .As Irsquove written before, the First Minister has to make a call on Indyref by mid-it is happen in this parliament, because of legislation and campaign time. Butthere was a second EU vote she would have to wait till that was over, and by then it would be too late.She canrsquot have two referendums running at once. That would be a dogrsquos dinner. But nor can she have one after the other because therersquos not enough time for both by .The Scottish Tories claimed this week that Ms Sturgeon is backing a Peoplersquos Vote to cause chaos and boost the prospects of the Yes movement. But Irsquod say a Peoplersquos Vote is more likely to stall the Yes movement, at least for a few years.Faced with this choice between two referendums, I wonder how SNP MPs will vote in the end."},{"url":null,"title":"prestwick-under-pressure-after-advertising-jobs-below-real-living-wage","story":"But five years on, Glasgow Prestwick Airport is under fresh pressure after it emerged it is still advertising jobs which fail to pay the real living wage, despite Nicola Sturgeon urging all employers to do so.Opponents have now accused Ms Sturgeon of ldquorank hypocrisy after she criticised the Ministry of Defence for paying more than  civilian staff less than the living wage during First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday.She said: ldquoThe MoD and all Government agencies should pay the real living wage.

It is also a ldquoersionary airport capable of dealing with planes experiencing security risks.A police source said the reduction was likely down to low passenger numbers, adding: ldquoCops are not there to protect the premises ndash thatrsquos the role of security. They are there for protecting passengers.The Scottish Government bought the Ayrshire site in November . The airport has since been handed more than pound million in loans despite continuing to make losses.Its accounts say this funding will continue for the ldquoforeseeable, but turnover is increasing. Meanwhile, extra revenue has come from fuelling aircraft.This is ldquoprimarily due to military activities on the back of being awarded a contract in October  with the Defense Logistics Agency, a combat support agency in the United States Department of Defense.However both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports claim Prestwickrsquos public subsidy has ldquodistorted the market, and bosses previously admitted it would be forced to shutasked to repay its loans.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said Prestwick was operated at armrsquosndash but signalled unhappiness over its continued failure to pay

Apart from the obvious fact that the mention of word Brexit sends most of us into a state of comatose anger delirium , this would be event TV at its most pointless.Unlike in the sort of debates wersquove become used to over the last few years, held before referendums and general elections - and indeed most of the shows it would replace in the schedules - no one other than the MPs watching would have a vote.Adding to the futility surrounding this set-up are the Brexit stances of the only two politicians invited to take part: barring a major change of heart, the positions being argued by Mrs May and Mr Corbyn would not only be similar, but similarly bad.The irony of all this is staggering. Here you have Mrs May, who voted Remain, trying to ram a terrible Brexit deal through Parliament that will, by her Governmentrsquos own admission, make the country poorer. This bleak halfway house leaves the UK worse off in every way, with no control or say over EU policy, having to align itself regardless, while losing all the benefits of the Single Market.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, a lelong Eurosceptic who claims he voted Remain, has taken his party to a bizarre, opaque and convoluted position that also has us leaving the EU, despite knowing full well this will cause genuine and serious harm to the very people and public services he has spent his political le trying to protect from Tory policy. He agrees with Mrs May on ending free movement and leaving the Single Market, his only real ergence from her being the continual peddling of the fantasy that the EU would give him a far better deal than it gave her. Just because hersquos Jezza, you understand.In some ways, you can see why Mrs May, never a natural performer on this type of , would nevertheless want to take part in a debate. Donrsquot think for a minute itrsquos about persuading the public to support her deal ndash we have no say. No, as is usually the case with the Tories, this would be about selling it to a faction, in this case the grassroots party membership, who she wants to pressure their MPs to vote with, rather than against, her.As for Mr Corbyn, who in another striking similarity with the PM is also a poor public communicator, Irsquom still trying to work out what he thinks he can get out of this exposure.And thatrsquos whyI was Nicola Sturgeon, Irsquod stay well out of it and let these two lame ducks go it alone. For now, at least.The First Minister, who is not only an excellent debater but has a clear and cogent position on Brexit, says she wants in on the action, to put the case for staying in the Single Market and or having a so-called Peoplersquos Vote.Like many, I share her concerns around Scotland being deliberately left out of the process, as her lack of an invite to the debate only highlights. But I honestly donrsquot think she should waste her time with this one.If and when the Peoplersquos Vote, or even another general election is called, both of which are possible scenarios, her voice will be needed to persuade not only Scots, but arguably more importantly voters around the UK, that Brexit can and must be stopped or at least signicantly watered down. In that scenario she should not only debate Mrs May and Mr Corbyn but be ready to make her case against hard Brexiteers like Boris Johnson.Until a meaningful opportunity arises, however, Ms Sturgeon should keep her powder clean and let Mrs May and Mr Corbyn keep fighting the phony war."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105685.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-to-tell-banks-that-brexit-deal-offers-clarity","story":"The Scottish Secretary will try to sell Theresa Mayrsquos deal at a briefing for Scotlandrsquos poundbn financial services sector in Edinburgh.:David Mundell faces cross-party calls to resignAmong the employers taking part will be RBS, Tesco Bank, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, KPMG, Pheonix Group, and CYBG, which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money UK.Also attending is Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body representing Scotlandrsquos financial services industry, whose members employ more than , people.The SNP said Mr Mundell must be ldquocompletely deludedhe believed his own spin, and said Mrs Mayrsquos deal and political agreement offered only uncertainty on trade relations.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: ldquoIf David Mundell is so confident in the Tory governmentrsquos dodgy deal, hersquoll put his neck on the line and resignit fails to pass through the Commons.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Monday  Dec  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amPassengers using the Northern Isles ferry services are set to benefit from improved on board facilities with investment worth more than £ million from the Scottish Government.

These concerns were echoed by the group of experts giving evidence to the Committee this morning.Speaking after the committee meeting, Mr McArthur said: “Today’s evidence session left no doubt at all that the Scottish Government is now isolated over its approach to tackle fuel poverty in rural and island areas. It is increasingly clear that Ministers will have to think again and ensure their proposals are properly #island proofed#.“In a desperate move yesterday evening, the Housing Minister issued a briefing to MSPs seeking to justy his decision not to include a rural Minimum Income Standard in the revised definition of rural fuel poverty.  This attempt by the Minister to get his retaliation in first backfired, however, as the Committee heard again today how this approach flies in the face of all the advice.“The Rural Fuel Poverty Task Force, the government’s own Independent Panel of Advisers and every organisation across the Highlands  Islands involved in housing and fuel poverty have made plain that excluding a rural MIS risks support not going to the people and communities who need it. As a result, the government’s own targets for combatting fuel poverty across the country will be undermined.“While fuel poverty is not simply an island issue, all the evidence shows that it affects rural and island communities more than others. Hopefully, today’s committee evidence session will persuade ministers to think again. If not, it will be up to parliament to force the government to do the right thing”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

People now realise itrsquos not just the employees that are going to be affected, itrsquos all their friends and families as well as many local businesses.\"And its not just Dingwall where this will be felt.

She said: \"This is extremely sad news for all the staff who have been loyal employees of the Edinburgh Salmon Company for many years. The business has had a long association with Dingwall and this closure will have a knock-on effect on many of the local businesses in the area.\"There is never a good time to be made redundant but in the run up to Christmas this is a double blow for many local families.MSP John Finne said: \"This is bitterly disappointing news from the Edinburgh Salmon Company, and will come as a blow to all those workers on site. I have sought assurances that the Scottish Government will continue to make every possible effort to assist the workforce of Edinburgh Salmon Company in light of this closure.\"There are fears that some families of Eastern European origin who have contributed to the local economy for upwards of a decade are now considering cutting their losses and leaving the area.\"I know because of this loads of people will go back to Poland,\" said a Polish national who has friends working there. \"Its going to be a dficult time for those people.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

May was warned of Northern Ireland backstop being ‘bad outcome’ for UK Tories say Labour leader running scared over TV debate with PM EU withdrawal tensions must not reignite Troubles, warns John Kerry The DUP declined to comment, but it is understood a letter to Speaker John Bercow has been drafted for signature by Nigel Dodds, Labours Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer, the Lib Dems and the SNP, claiming ministers refusal to give MPs the legal advice is in contempt of Parliament.The move, which could spark an historic constitutional row, is to be submitted today unless ministers have a change of heart.And it would put further strain on the DUPs relationship with Mrs May as she struggles to win backing for her deal in the crucial Commons vote on December .Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News: \"If they dont produce it [the legal advice] tomorrow, then we will start contempt proceedings, this will be a collision course between the government and Parliament.\"MPs have angrily accused ministers of ignoring the will of the House after they said only they would release a \"full reasoned political statement\" on the legal position.It follows a binding Commons vote last month requiring the Government to lay before Parliament \"any legal advice in full\" - including that given by the Attorney General - relating to the Withdrawal Agreement.It was reported yesterday that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - who is due to make a statement to the Commons today -

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"chocolate fans are divided after advent calendar reveals a bounty on december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

start of  so we were here before ‘Derry Girls’,” she explained.“I love the Derry sense of humour.“It is sharp, playfully sarcastic and uniquely authentic to our great city.“I have long thought that we needed a  to high light our never ending ability to laugh at ourselves inspire of all we endured over many years of hardship.”The slap stick show features Mags, her husband Jimbo, their son Whacky-Backy, fourteen daughter year old Majella and Mags’ sister Lola, the ‘over ripened Lady-of-the-night’.“Each episode is a complete story,” said Irene, who also acts in the show. “This is raw comedy, irreverent and unapologetically, politically incorrect.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

on a shoe string budget, but Irene is hoping it will be picked up by a production company and brought to TV.“To date we have made six episodes,” she said.  “We would love to do one a week, but we have no funding so it’s dficult for some of the group who must work.“All of us in the show do it because we love the craic.“I have a truly great team of local actors and for some of them it’s their first time acting and I can tell you, as a veteran of many years on the stage, they have incredible comedy timing.“I am privileged to have found them.“The pleasure of hearing from so many people that we brighten their day makes it all worthwhile.“I’ve been contacted on Facebook from people from England and Canada saying it’s great and asking why they have never seen it on TV.”To see the show visit

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -. Relief rather than elation from the home supporters as they made their way home.Ballynahinch Banbridge AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Chairman gives his backing to ‘green’ off road paths scheme  ","story":"A CAMPAIGN to connect Downpatrick with the Rowallane area via a series of off-road paths has secured the backing of the districtrsquos first citizen.A delegation of residents met recently with Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin to discuss extending the existing Quoile River walk towards Killyleagh. A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

A comprehensive design scheme would also have to be worked up.NI Water officials have also confirmed Saintfield is one of a number of towns across the Province which requires signicant investment to upgrade the existing infrastructure to carter for current and future demand.Rowallane politicians fear the moratorium on new development in Saintfield could potentially be in place for two years and have urged senior NI Water officials to do all they can to expedite the work that is required. They say the current ban will not only have a major impact on residents and developers, but the townrsquos economy.NI Waterrsquos Stephen Blockwell confirmed to Newry, Mourne and Down councillors that the drainage study will not be completed until next December. He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme.

It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Historian Gordon Lucy looks at his le and legacyHenry Cooke was born at Grillagh, near Maghera, Co Londonderry.He was actually born Macook, but by the time of his ordination in  the ‘Ma’ was dropped from his surname. The ‘e’ was added later.As the Rev Dr Henry Cooke, he became one of the most influential Presbyterian ministers of the th century and one of the great public figures of Belfast. Lord Cairns, the Belfast-born Conservative politician and lord chancellor in both of Disraeli’s administrations, observed that Cooke’s le constituted “a large portion of the religious and public history of Ireland”.In his own letime Henry Cooke was referred to by his opponents as the ‘Presbyterian Pope’ because they believed that he wished to exercise more influence than the office allowed. Certainly annually elected Presbyterian moderators do not exercise the same level of authority and control over their denomination as Roman pontfs exert over theirs.In the s Cooke was also hailed as ‘the Presbyterian Athanasius’ on account of his role in the Second Subscription Crisis. St Athanasius of Alexandriawas the champion of Trinitarianism in the conflict with Ariusand Arianism, the heresy which bears his name, at the First Council of Nicea in .It was said of the young Athanasius – he was in his late s – that he stood ‘contra mundum’in defence of the biblical doctrine of Christ when it seemed ‘all the world’ would follow Arius’s heresy. Many Presbyterians viewed Cooke as fulfilling the same role in the doctrinal disputes which convulsed Presbyterian Ulster in the early th century. Cooke gave shape to the theology of Ulster’s largest Protestant denomination.As F S L Lyons observed in Culture and Anarchy in Ireland -, that ‘the victory of the so-called “Old Light” [ie traditional Presbyterianism Calvinism] over the “New Light” [ie more liberal Presbyterianism] meant in broad terms, the deliberate adoption by a majority of Presbyterians of an equivocally evangelical stance’, and quoted J E Davey’s volume commemorating the centenary of the General Assembly to the effect that it was ‘the choice of grace and faith and revelation in place of the seeming alternative of law and logic it was a conscious suffrage cast for God and religion rather than for man and his speculations’.Politically, Henry Cooke has been held responsible for the fusion of conservative evangelicalism and Conservative unionism and accused of – or credited with – leading the Presbyterian community away from a liberal past to a more conservative future. This has prompted him to be called ‘the father of Ulster Unionism’.NI’s Euro  qualying group revealedNI youngster, ,rushed to hospital after taking white powder Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In the late s Cooke’s family had faced intimidation because of their hostility to the United Irishmen. This experience helped shape Cooke’s underlying political conservatism. At Hillsborough in October  he anticipated the formation of the Unionist Party in the mid-s by publishing ‘the banns of a marriage’ between the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian Church. Cooke’s vision was not realised in his own letime.In January  he famously repudiated Daniel O’Connell’s case for Repeal of the Act of Union by highlighting how Belfast had grown and prospered under the Union.Cooke was never the spokesman for all Presbyterians. The Rev A P Goudy of Strabane, the grandson of the Rev James Porter of Greyabbeyon his mother’s side, shared Cooke’s theology but not his Conservative politics.The Rev Isaac Nelson, a Protestant nationalist and the future Parnellite MP for Co Mayo, was as hostile to Cooke’s politics as he was to Cooke’s theology.A robust Liberal strand survived in Presbyterianism right up until the first Home Rule crisis of -. However, with Gladstone’s conversion to Home Rule Cooke’s pan-Protestant alliance became reality – less than  years after his death. Arguably, it was Gladstone’s conversion to Home Rule rather than Cooke which destroyedpolitical liberalism among Ulster Presbyterians.Cooke died on December  . The following day the conservative-leaning News Letter announced that ‘A Prince of the church had fallen’ and carried an obituary which extended over four and a half columns.Cooke’s admirers disregarded his wish for a private funeral. At a public meeting held in the Town Hall a resolution was passed to accord the great man a civic funeral. William Johnston of Ballykilbeg, one of the two recently elected MPs for Belfast, proposed the motion, which was seconded by the Bishop of Down. The funeral on December  was attended by civic and ecclesiastical dignitaries, the mourners included the moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Church of Ireland primate of All Ireland and the Roman Catholic bishop of Down  Connor.The presence of the Roman Catholic bishop of Down  Connor may occasion some surprise but stern Protestant although Cooke was, Cooke regarded the Roman Catholic Church as a Christian church, albeit in error, and no one was more ready to assist a Roman Catholic neighbour in time of need. Cooke had a capacity for friendship which transcended political and religious boundaries. Barney Hughes, the celebrated Belfast baker and Roman Catholic member of Belfast Corporation, was a close personal friend.The funeral procession stretched for two miles,  carriages following the hearse. Thousands lined the route, businesses closed and shops along the way to Balmoral cemetery were draped in black. The News Letter reported that it was ‘in all respects like a royal or imperial demonstration’.In March  a statue of Henry Cookewas placed in front of Royal Belfast Academical Institution. Perhaps appropriately Cooke’s back was turned towards the school which during his letime he had regarded, rightly or wrongly, as a hotbed of Arianism. Signicantly too, the statue was erected not by his fellow Presbyterians but by members of the Orange Institution.Although Cooke had never been a member, he had long been something of a hero to Orangemen. Presbyterians celebrated the centenary of what they believed to be Cooke’s birth by building Cooke Centenary Church on the Ormeau Road in Belfast in .try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Christmas1.jpg","title":"thought about the christmas party its just a few weeks away","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business A time for giving, the festive party is an event that puts the spotlight firmly on employer gratitude. Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.
