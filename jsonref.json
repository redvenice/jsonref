[{"url":null,"title":"If Tower Londons raven master loses birds legend Britain turn dust","story":"    Chris Skaife, Master Raven Keeper at the Tower of London, pictured with Merlina the ravenThe reigning champion is Munin, who, at 23, is the oldest and longest-serving of the seven ravens at the Tower.She came here in 1995 when she was only six weeks old and has had three partners. As two of them are now dead, she is affectionately known as the Black Widow and currently has a younger partner, five-year-old Jubilee. All I can do is wish him well.I have something of a troubled relationship with Munin. Sometimes I think she hates me.She has been giving me the run-around for years and, since research suggests that ravens can recognise human faces, I can only assume that I did something horrendous in my early days at the Tower for which she has never forgiven me.Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London...The \u0027Temple of Transportation\u0027 that Jackie Kennedy helped...Share this articleI started working here as a Yeoman Warder, as we Beefeaters are properly known, in 2005.All of us, servicemen and women, have long records of unblemished service — in my case, almost 25 years as an infantryman.That took me all over the world and eventually to the Tower of London, with its bloody history of murder, torture and, of course, ravens.Without them, the legend goes, great harm will befall the kingdom and the Tower itself will crumble into dust.      Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower of London in the 1960sThe man had managed to capture Munin using only a holdall and a blanket — together with a thick pair of gardening gloves and some chicken legs to tempt her.Thanking him for helping us to save the kingdom, we placed Munin in her travel box and made our way back to the Tower, where I reflected on an important lesson. Never underestimate the ravens.I often try to see the Tower through their eyes: the sheer looming mass of the buildings, like cliffs, and the continual hubbub of sound, like the howl of the tundra all those potential playmates and the ever-present threat of predators.We will never know all of what goes on inside their heads but they certainly seem to have the capacity to remember.When Derrick Coyle visited the Tower some seven years after leaving as Ravenmaster, for example, Merlina came straight to him. It was as if he’d never been away. Seven years!Following my time in the Army, caring for the ravens has meant becoming a part of another family — learning to trust and be trusted —and doing what I can to the best of my ability when they need my help.And if you have enjoyed reading about my life with these remarkable creatures, perhaps I can ask a small favour.Years from now, long after our current ravens have gone, and I, too, have passed on to that great raven enclosure in the sky, you may be visiting the Tower. Perhaps there will be a raven there named after me, and this Skaife may be looking at you in that way only ravens can.Don’t get too close — he may bite. But say hello from me.Kn-ck, kn-ck. Kn-ck, kn-ck. Adapted from The Ravenmaster: My Life With The Ravens At The Tower Of London, by Christopher Skaife, published tomorrow by Fourth Estate at £14.99 © Christopher Skaife 2018.

Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in most circumstances in the U.S.Kavanaugh had previously stated that the Roe v. Wade decision was ‘settled law’ in the country.The Maine Senator previously voted to confirm Kavanaugh after he was nominated by former President George W. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.Despite her previous confirmation vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Collins has faced intense pressure to vote against his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. A group of progressive activists has reportedly raised more than $1.75 million (£1.3m) in crowdfunding and vowed to release the funds to her future campaign opponents if she indeed votes in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Both the campaign funds and confirmation vote could have a key impact on Collins’s future Senate race, as polls reportedly showed that Maine voters were less likely to support Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh – even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced.Senator Lisa Murkowski – Republican from AlaskaMurkowski, much like Collins, has become known as one of the leading moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate.The 61-year-old Senator, who has been a member of the legislative chamber since 2002, has been known as an independent voice during her tenure, supporting abortion rights and, alongside Collins, helping to scuttle an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama.Murkowski’s self-imposed test on the Kavanaugh confirmation vote comes, not from perilous reelection prospects – she’s not up for reelection until 2022 in a reliably Republican state – but whether women who allege that a sexual assault took place against them should be taken seriously.‘We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed,’ she said.Murkowski, who soon joined fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake in calling for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, does indeed have a political balancing act to do ahead of the confirmation vote.The Senator has long been supported by Native Alaskans, whose backing of her could falter after it was revealed by Hawaii Senator Mazie K. Hirono that Kavanaugh appeared to question whether Native Hawaiians were a legitimate protected group.          Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has a history of crossing party lines in the U.S. SenateSenator Jeff Flake – Republican from ArizonaFlake, 55, has long been a thorn in President Trump’s side. A vocal critic of the President who’s served in the U.S. Senate since 2013 and previously in the U.S. House of Representatives, Flake’s vote is seen as crucial.Unencumbered by political pressure – he’s opted not to run for reelection this year – Flake has expressed support for Kavanaugh’s conservative views but cautioned that the confirmation process needs the support of the whole country, something very difficult in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the polarized political climate that’s gripped the United States in recent years.‘I want to support him. I’m a conservative, he’s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the country needs to be behind it,’ he said.Flake, who said that the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford left him with ‘as much doubt as certainty,’ voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination but was also the first Republican Senator to call for an official FBI investigation to the allegations made against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.He’s made his views known that he intends to ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh unless the ongoing investigation turns up evidence the nominee lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee or engaged in unlawful sexual conduct.Though he has a long history of bucking Trump’s demands, Flake did indeed vote to confirm the President’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Senator Heidi Heitkamp – Democrat from North DakotaHeitkamp, 62, has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently locked in a tight reelection battle in a state won easily by Trump.The North Dakota Senator, who previously voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, appeared to express at least some degree of support for Kavanaugh before the sexual misconduct allegations against him arose, even praising him as ‘highly-qualified’ for the position of Supreme Court Justice.However, the allegations against the nominee may have given Heitkamp pause.At a recent campaign stop in Grand Forks, North Dakota, she said that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be something that’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ and also blasted her campaign opponent, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, for being critical of Ford’s allegations, denouncing the congressman as someone who has ‘a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience.’She’s also backed the ongoing FBI probe centered on the allegations made against Kavanaugh, saying: ‘We need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job’  Heidi Heitkamp, left, is currently locked in a close reelection battle with Kevin Cramer, rightSenator Joe Manchin – Democrat from West VirginiaManchin, a 71-year-old conservative Democrat, is also facing reelection in a state overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Having first joined the Senate in 2010, Manchin voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 and has sided with Republicans on a number of issues.However, the West Virginia Senator has cited healthcare as a key deciding factor for him when it comes to Kavanaugh’s nomination, as he’s said that he’d like to see U.S. courts preserve the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans suffering with preexisting conditions.So far, Manchin has dropped few hints as to whether he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, but has stated that the judge had ‘all the right qualities’ after meeting with him earlier in 2018.Manchin has also backed the FBI investigation on the allegations made against Kavanaugh and has indicated he’d base his vote on the judge’s credentials if no evidence was found backing up the accusations made against Kavanaugh.‘If there’s nothing conclusive, then it’ll be based on the merits of him being qualified,’ he said. \u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

It has now been deleted.\u0027 The revelations raise serious questions about the politicisation of the rail network, which has suffered huge disruption over the past 12 months. Ms Augustine, who has worked for American Express, Vodafone and Barclays, fills her Facebook timeline with pro-Labour material. In September, she wrote: \u0027Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of socialism\u0027, and described a fellow Corbynite\u0027s new baby as \u0027a Labour gain\u0027. In August, she wrote, \u0027Rise like lions… join the Labour party\u0027, alongside a picture of Mr Corbyn carrying the slogan, \u0027I have Jeremy\u0027s back because he has mine\u0027.           Ms Ausgustine (left) is a staunch Jeremy Corbyn supporter and a member of the hard-left militant group, Momentum.

Mr Horton was also in charge of London Midland when it lost its franchise last year. Earlier this month, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, announced Labour\u0027s intention to nationalise the rail system with five years of taking power. The party\u0027s 2017 general election manifesto pledged to bring private railway companies into public hands as their franchises expire. Speaking ahead of the party conference, Mr McDonnell said: \u0027I think we are in a situation now where I think that is certainly possible. \u0027We want to get within the first term of a Labour government an integrated railway system.\u0027 According to Labour policies, a public ownership unit would be established within the Treasury to develop a roadmap towards the re-nationalisation of utilities and rail services. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/21/509F967B00000578-0-image-a-28_1538599834404.jpg","title":"BFI London Film Festival 2018 need know 62nd BFI LFF","story":"\u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

After my early-morning routine, I feel energized, my mind is clear, and I’m ready to sit at my laptop and focus 100 percent on being productive. I keep a separate space a short distance across the lawn from our house. I call it the Sanctuary.‘I love it. It’s clean and quiet and sparsely decorated, with plants, crystals, high ceilings, and lots of light. I spend most of the day there answering emails and phone calls and having meetings.’‘Often in the mornings I am in close contact with my twin sister, Pati, and Fafi, discussing business, evaluating new opportunities, approving material for clients, answering interview questions, or working on environmental projects. Today, most of the companies I work with are in Brazil, and I consistently express my concerns about our environment, and the need to create products and practices that are sustainable for the earth.’She adds: ‘Although I’ve been working in my industry for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that I learned that the fashion industry, especially fast fashion, is one of the biggest polluters on the earth, and that most clothes end up in landfills.‘I am now using my voice and contacts to bring attention to this problem, and to develop solutions to make the business of fashion more sustainable.’She barely has enough time to do all of it too, it seems: ‘My days are extremely full – and never quite long enough.

But it all depends on how I’m feeling. If I’m getting sick, for example, I’ll drink fennel tea, or prepare a honey-lemon-ginger concoction on the stove.

To live a full and meaningful life with the awareness of what’s happening around me – and to inspire my children to live that way, too.‘Bedtime is another ritual. When Tom his home, he kisses the kids good night and sometimes he tells them a story. At bedtime, I love reading out loud to each child. Then I do something I ‘ve done since Benny and Vivi were infants: I give them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy. Five minutes of foot rubbing really calms them down, and makes us feel close.‘The last thing I do before saying good night is to remind them to pray to their guardian angel. I often wait outside their rooms, listening to them saying their prayers, and it melts my heart every time.’Tom usually goes to bed by 9pm, she writes, whereas she can stay up as late as 10, though she showers before going to bed ‘especially if they used lots of product and my hair looks crazy.’ (It’s not exactly clear who ‘they’ are.’‘I need at least seven hours of sleep, eight if I can get it,’ she writes. ‘Thankfully I’ve never had any trouble falling asleep. I’m usually exhausted at night, and as soon as I put my head on the pillow, I am gone.’And so ends a typical day in the life of the wife of America’s favorite quarterback, only to begin again in the early-morning hours with another rake of health-consciousness, exercise, mindfulness and even makeup – though of course, as the supermodel emphasizes, it’s not an obligation.Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life: Gisele Bündchen: 9780525538646: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/21/50EFCB2B00000578-0-image-m-9_1538513118635.jpg","title":"First trailer released showing Christian Bales transformation Dick Cheney","story":"From Batman to VP: Christian Bale has transformed himself into Dick Cheney for his latest role in the upcoming film Vice       Jennifer Lawrence is seen vaping on the street in NYC in...Ben Affleck looks as if he\u0027s auditioning for his old Batman...Share this articleThe blink-and-you-missed-it clip briefly shows Cheney with his wife, Lynn, portrayed by his American Hustle co-star Amy Adams, and offers a few glimpses into his career and life, including the infamous 2006 quail hunting accident, in which the hawkish VP inadvertently shot a friend in the face. The movie, which is set to open in theaters on December 25, follows Cheney\u0027s rise to power within the Bush administration between 2001 and 2009.Bale, who is widely known in Hollywood for undergoing dramatic physical transformations for movie roles, has said that in order to embody Cheney, he packed up 40lbs, shaved his head and bleached and plucked his eyebrows daily during shooting.

The first suggestion is for families to make time to bake, with the company saying that baked treats such as scones only take half an hour to make.Another tip is to get everyone involved as baking can require many hands. ‘Baking has lots of processes – be it choosing the recipe, buying the ingredients, weighing out the ingredients, mixing, stirring, lining tins, kneading dough, washing up or simply eating – so there is a job to suit everyone.’The site recommends people bake with their children: ‘Most of us have a story of baking with parents or grandparents that we remember. And there is nothing better than your own mum\u0027s cakes, pies and biscuits. Now it is our opportunity to create those memories for our own children or grandchildren.’Everyone is also encouraged to be creative during National Baking Week and make baking as easy or as complicated as they want it to be. ‘You can choose a recipe that has very few steps, or as your confidence grows you can push the boat out and make something that will take a little longer and use more skill’. People are also encouraged to play around with different ingredients.The site also provides a list of baking equipment essentials, which includes measure jugs, different-sized bowls, whisks, sieves, rolling pins, oven trays, greaseproof paper and more. National Baking Week also provides a list of recipes for keen bakers to use including simple recipes such as Crisp vanilla butter cookies.Crisp vanilla butter cookies recipe   To make Crisp vanilla butter cookies, follow the recipe below:Cream the Stork, icing sugar and vanilla extract until smooth. Then beat the eggs one at a time until they’re mixed and fluffy. Then the remaining dry ingredients (self-raising flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt) should be added until they’re all blended.The cookie dough should then be shaped into a log, wrapped in baking parchment and left to chill for 3-24 hours.The oven should then be preheated to 350°C and the slices of cookie dough placed on a non-stick cookie baking sheet. Baking time should take 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are golden brown. Cool down the cookies before drizzling them with melted chocolate.For more recipes see the National Baking Week recipe page.\u0026#8216F*ck Kavanaugh\u0027 lipstick: Lipslut product aims to raise money for sexual assault victim charitiesVenom end credits scene explained: What is the link to Spiderman?Diana the musical: All you need to know about the Princess Diana theatre productionKhabib Nurmagomedov net worth revealed ahead of Conor McGregor fight at UFC 229National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday 3rd OctoberFan Bingbing net worth: X-men star\u0027s wealth revealed after she went \u0027missing\u0027Who is Loni Willison?

As two of them are now dead, she is affectionately known as the Black Widow and currently has a younger partner, five-year-old Jubilee. All I can do is wish him well.I have something of a troubled relationship with Munin. Sometimes I think she hates me.She has been giving me the run-around for years and, since research suggests that ravens can recognise human faces, I can only assume that I did something horrendous in my early days at the Tower for which she has never forgiven me.Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London...The \u0027Temple of Transportation\u0027 that Jackie Kennedy helped...Share this articleI started working here as a Yeoman Warder, as we Beefeaters are properly known, in 2005.All of us, servicemen and women, have long records of unblemished service — in my case, almost 25 years as an infantryman.That took me all over the world and eventually to the Tower of London, with its bloody history of murder, torture and, of course, ravens.Without them, the legend goes, great harm will befall the kingdom and the Tower itself will crumble into dust.      Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower of London in the 1960sThe man had managed to capture Munin using only a holdall and a blanket — together with a thick pair of gardening gloves and some chicken legs to tempt her.Thanking him for helping us to save the kingdom, we placed Munin in her travel box and made our way back to the Tower, where I reflected on an important lesson. Never underestimate the ravens.I often try to see the Tower through their eyes: the sheer looming mass of the buildings, like cliffs, and the continual hubbub of sound, like the howl of the tundra all those potential playmates and the ever-present threat of predators.We will never know all of what goes on inside their heads but they certainly seem to have the capacity to remember.When Derrick Coyle visited the Tower some seven years after leaving as Ravenmaster, for example, Merlina came straight to him. It was as if he’d never been away. Seven years!Following my time in the Army, caring for the ravens has meant becoming a part of another family — learning to trust and be trusted —and doing what I can to the best of my ability when they need my help.And if you have enjoyed reading about my life with these remarkable creatures, perhaps I can ask a small favour.Years from now, long after our current ravens have gone, and I, too, have passed on to that great raven enclosure in the sky, you may be visiting the Tower. Perhaps there will be a raven there named after me, and this Skaife may be looking at you in that way only ravens can.Don’t get too close — he may bite. But say hello from me.Kn-ck, kn-ck.

The company has invested in a new factory in SlovakiaSpeculation about the size, shape and timing of the new generation Defender - the original Land Rover of 1948  - has been rife since its production ended with a series of collectors\u0027 special editions.The Defender began as the original Land Rover  and this year is celebrating its 70th anniversary.Loved by the Queen, driven by Winston Churchill and adored by millions loyal drivers including soldiers of the British Army and SAS - it was launched on April 30, 1948 at the Amsterdam Motor Show.The original Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey the workhorse vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then using.          Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out the original Land Rover in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey, Wales          The vehicle was needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then usingSo in 1948 Britain\u0027s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and launched at that year\u0027s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world\u0027s first mass-produced civilian 4X4 costing £450. With post-war rationing and steel in short supply but masses of aluminium around, the vehicle was initially made with the lightweight metal. The original sage-green paint was acquired from a fighter plane factory.The first pilot pre-production model was called \u0027Huey\u0027 after its registration number \u0027HUE 166\u0027 and is fully working.Astonishingly, some three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are said to be still in regular use.Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.          In 1948 Britain\u0027s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and launched at that year\u0027s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world\u0027s first mass-produced civilian 4X4          Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land RoverThe Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has used Land Rovers ever since.The Queen used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953, Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II\u0027s tour of England in 1982.And shortly after ending his love affair with young Princess Margaret in the 1950s, former battle of Britain pilot Group Captain Peter Townsend set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world in his short Wheelbase Land Rover Station Wagon which he completed in 1957 and chronicled in his book \u0027Earth, My Friend.\u0027          The Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first Land Rover shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has consistently driven them ever since          Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell          Pictured: The current version of the Land Rover Defender with historic \u0027HUE\u0027 license plateThe Defender became a regular movie star featuring heavily in the film Born Free (1966) about the story of Elsa the Lion. Defenders are still used today by the Born Free Foundation whose founder Virginia McKenna OBE was in the movie. Hollywood actor Steve McQueen was a fan. It also featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond movie, Skyfall.The Defender name itself can be traced back to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover launched the previous year called Discovery.Military versions of the Defender have seen service around the globe and the armed forces have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the UK built Land Rover with the most famous being those used by the SAS in the desert, nicknamed \u0027pinkies\u0027 after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes.To cheering and applause from the workforce at Land Rover\u0027s Solihull factory near Birmingham, the final Land Rover Defender 4X4 drove off the production line in January 2016 and joined the firm\u0027s heritage collection. A radical new generation Defender is to be launched next year.          The Defender became a regular movie star featuring heavily in the film Born Free (1966)          It featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond film SkyfallTo mark the final year of the classic Defender Land Rover launched a series of official special editions ranging in price from £27,800 to £61,845.At the Frankfurt Motor Show seven years ago Jaguar Land Rover signalled how potential hi-tech replacements for the Defender would look, unveiling a macho, open-topped off-roader - codenamed DS100 Sport - designed to be as useful off-road as the trusty original. It also showed off a more fun-packed version looking like a beach-buggy, as well as a more practical workhorse version.In January, Land Rover announced plans to \u0027sympathetically renovate\u0027 the world\u0027s most historically significant unrestored model – one of three pre-production cars from the original Amsterdam motor show launch on 30th April 1948.It will take the stage at the Land Rover Classic event alongside its closest modern relative – the 405PS Defender Works V8 revealed earlier this year, of which only 150 will be produced."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/06/23/4FCD8CE000000578-0-image-m-22_1536272144578.jpg","title":"Comms chief Govia Thameslink called Transport Minister Chris Grayling SACKED","story":"    Cathy Augustine, Head of Internal Communications for Govia Thameslink Railway, is a fanatical Labour supporter who called for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to be sacked          Referring to the Tory minister as \u0027Failing Grayling\u0027, Ms Augustine wrote that in \u0027a business context\u0027, his performance would \u0027at least trigger an investigation process\u0027Official report into timetable chaos that ruined train...That\u0027s out of line!

It has now been deleted.\u0027 The revelations raise serious questions about the politicisation of the rail network, which has suffered huge disruption over the past 12 months. Ms Augustine, who has worked for American Express, Vodafone and Barclays, fills her Facebook timeline with pro-Labour material. In September, she wrote: \u0027Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of socialism\u0027, and described a fellow Corbynite\u0027s new baby as \u0027a Labour gain\u0027. In August, she wrote, \u0027Rise like lions… join the Labour party\u0027, alongside a picture of Mr Corbyn carrying the slogan, \u0027I have Jeremy\u0027s back because he has mine\u0027.           Ms Ausgustine (left) is a staunch Jeremy Corbyn supporter and a member of the hard-left militant group, Momentum.

Mr Horton was also in charge of London Midland when it lost its franchise last year. Earlier this month, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, announced Labour\u0027s intention to nationalise the rail system with five years of taking power. The party\u0027s 2017 general election manifesto pledged to bring private railway companies into public hands as their franchises expire. Speaking ahead of the party conference, Mr McDonnell said: \u0027I think we are in a situation now where I think that is certainly possible. \u0027We want to get within the first term of a Labour government an integrated railway system.\u0027 According to Labour policies, a public ownership unit would be established within the Treasury to develop a roadmap towards the re-nationalisation of utilities and rail services. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/18/50EDE65100000578-0-image-m-30_1538501234483.jpg","title":"A day life Gisele Coconut oil sun gazing aromatherapy foot massages kids","story":"    Gisele Bundchen, 38, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has just published new book Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life - which details her daily routine, workout regime, diet and meditation schedule          She and Brady are parents to son Benny, 8, and daughter Vivi, 5, as well as the athlete\u0027s older son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan          Gisele writes her day starts between 5am and 6am, when she rises to \u0027ocean\u0027 sounds on her phone she then spends up to 15 minutes swilling coconut oil in her mouth in a process known as \u0027pulling\u0027     Gisele, a native of Brazil, married Brady in 2009 the model writes: \u0027It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive\u0027          Gisele, pictured in the web television series Tom vs Time, lives outside of Boston with Brady and their family, in addition to enjoying a property in Montana\u0027s exclusive Yellowstone Club - which featured heavily in the program          Gisele says her children perform daily chores, and she emphasizes cleaning she likes to leave \u0027rooms as tidy as I found them\u0027          Gisele writes in the book that she enjoys taking her children to school herself each night, she gives \u0027them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy.

It is a genuine consultation. If we are going to improve the nation\u0027s diet, we need the support of the people, the industry and retailers . We are not going to outlaw free poppadoms. But we definitely have free unlimited refills for sugary drinks in our sights.\u0027We are keen to talk about free refills on sugary drinks. If the retailer is offering unlimited full-fat drink because you\u0027ve bought a sandwich, that is something we want to talk about ending.\u0027The rules would be enshrined in law and firms breaching them would be issued with fixed penalty notices.But retailers last night warned this would ‘punish’ businesses, with no evidence it would even work – while opposition politicians branded the proposal ‘joyless’.Unlimited drink refills would be outlawed, and staff would be forbidden from ‘upselling’ through ‘go large’ deals at the tills.Couple are selling their \u0027dream home\u0027 with its own private...Plant-lover turns his back-garden in Coventry into tropical...Share this articleThere would also be a ban on loyalty card points for junk food, and customers would not be able to use money-off coupons when buying unhealthy snacks.Retailers would even be prevented from placing such items in prominent display areas, such as near the tills. Crisps, sweets, savoury snacks, sugary soft-drinks, cakes and pastries are all being targeted as these so-called ‘discretionary’ foods provide little nutrition and are high in sugar, salt or fat.According to a consultation document published yesterday, ‘savoury snacks’ such as prawn crackers and poppadums – often given away free with takeaways – ‘could not be part of a meal deal’.But the proposed crackdown last night sparked ridicule, while the Scottish Government attempted to backtrack.          Health campaigners claim offering free extras is helping fuel the obesity epidemic           One person claimed that any threat to the supply of prawn crackers was \u0027un-British\u0027 David Thomson, of the Food and Drink Federation in Scotland, said: ‘We are deeply disappointed that the Scottish Government is pressing ahead with legislation to restrict food and drink promotions, especially since there is no evidence of the effectiveness of these measures in tackling obesity.‘Instead of punishing Scottish businesses we would urge the Scottish Government to work in partnership with the food and drink industry.’Scottish Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ‘Scotland’s obesity problem is significant and should be addressed through education, physical activity and a balanced diet. But these joyless proposals are simply over the top.‘The SNP knows that banning free poppadums is not going to solve the obesity crisis, but it’s far more eye-catching than doing the hard work that will really help Scots to become healthier.’According to Cancer Research UK, obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, responsible for 2,200 cases in Scotland every year. Minister for Wellbeing Joe FitzPatrick pointed out that Scotland has one of the worst public health records in Europe and described the proposals as ‘ground-breaking’.He added: ‘No country has yet introduced such measures, so we cannot use the experience of others to demonstrate likely success.‘We should not let that dissuade us, nor should we shirk from this challenge. Scotland has a positive history of taking ambitious and pioneering action to protect the public’s health.’          The proposals are contained in a consultation paper Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or SaltThe proposals are spelled out in a consultation paper titled Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or Salt.Professor Linda Bauld, spokesman for Cancer Research UK, said: ‘The introduction of laws to curb bargain buys for food and drink high in fat and sugar would be an effective way of helping people make healthier choices.’ But Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers’ Federation, said: ‘This is yet another attempt to interfere in the way retailers go about their business and there is very little evidence that restricting promotions will have the desired effect.’Chris Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank, said: ‘The blunt anti-obesity policies... are pregnant with unintended consequences, of which banning complimentary poppadums is just one.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, admitted: ‘It will be hugely unpopular with a huge number of people but if we are to do anything serious we’ve really got to look at this problem.’When asked about the issue of prawn crackers and poppadums, a Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We have been clear that we are not looking to make restrictions in relation to main meals, and it is not our intention to restrict restaurants from including savoury foods, such as prawn crackers or poppadums, as part of meals.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Wild elephants CHARGE terrified tourists safari bus","story":"    The herd of elephants wandering down a dirt track in Bandipur National Park, southern India  One of the elephants breaks free from the herd and charges menacingly at the safari bus          The elephant eventually gives up the chase and can be seen seconds later wandering into the forest with the rest of the herd"},{"url":null,"title":"Meet Mrs Sleep French teacher grabbed Prince Harrys hand forcing beg let go","story":"    Charlotte Sleep, a teacher at Westbourne House School in Chichester, took 13 of her pupils to meet Harry and Meghan todayThis is the school teacher who made Prince Harry laugh and comically attempt to pull away from her after she refused to stop shaking his hand.Charlotte Sleep, a French teacher at Westbourne House School in Chichester, had taken 13 children to meet the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in the city today.The children hand-made the royals an A-Z guide to Sussex, their new namesake – an A3 book which featured everything from Arundel to local celebrity Zoe Ball.\u0027We\u0027ve come to see you,\u0027 Ms Sleep explained.

Over time they have been bred smaller and smaller, to barely 38 inches highBut these miniature Shetland ponies have been through seven circles of hell.Many have been physically and mentally abused. Some were abandoned in water-logged fields, sheds or outhouses left tethered, thin and louse-ridden, in car parks.Others spent years cooped up in suburban back gardens — neglected pets that had lost their novelty value — before being offered on second-hand websites for as little as a fiver.All are victims of people’s obsession with dinkier ponies. They have been bred smaller and smaller, to barely 38 inches high — not slowly over time by evolution, but quickly by unregulated breeders to meet a passing fad.Closer up, the scars are visible. Butterscotch, a gorgeous cream dun, has an open wound on his face where horse-sized teeth far too big for his miniature head have caused an abscess. The six-year-old is scheduled for an operation next week.Meanwhile, mis-shapen bones in their hind legs cause Teddy and Felicity such pain they’re struggling to walk.          A comparison showing a full sized horse with a tiny Shetland Pony. A super-cute, teeny young horse can go for up to £3,000Bijou, a 23-year-old miniature white-spotted horse, is completely blind and is guided around by her mother, Dainty, who has had her front teeth removed and has to ‘gum’ the grass to eat.The wounds on Barney’s black face and the lash marks that left the skin on his back in tatters have healed, but he is still nervy and jumpy.All suffer from problems with their knees and teeth.Patchwork, a ten-year-old piebald with a gorgeous flowing mane, had such bad laminitis (a potentially devastating condition affecting hooves caused by the wrong diet of over-rich grass) that vets recommended he was put to sleep the day he arrived at Munchkins, four years ago.‘I just couldn’t do it,’ says Tammy Marx, who runs Munchkins, just one of several sanctuaries around the country. ‘I had a feeling he’d make it.’And miniature Shetlands are just the latest in a long line of animals to be catastrophically overbred to satisfy human fads and fashions. They are the equine equivalent of miniature hand-bag dogs, or pugs with faces so trendily flat that the poor, benighted animals struggle to breathe.The trigger for the Shetland crisis appears to have been two adverts.One, in 2013, was for the mobile phone firm Three, in which, thanks to special effects, a Shetland pony appears to be dancing to a Fleetwood Mac song.The second, far more damaging, was an Amazon advert in which a miniature Shetland with dwarfism was shown popping in and out of a cat flap and watching television. Suddenly, it seemed, everyone wanted a pet pony — and the smaller the better.‘If you look at the advert in detail, not only is the pony a dwarf Shetland, you can see it’s lame,’ says Tammy, 50. ‘Shetlands with dwarfism are the least healthy — with a dish face, pot-belly, short limbs and sarcoids (viral or cancerous growths).’But people who ooh-ed and ah-ed at the adverts didn’t realise.All they could see was an impossibly cute horse that could join their family as a designer pet, be saddled up for their tot to ride, cost next to nothing to care for and even mow the grass into the bargain.     Ponies recovering from poor treatment at Barnby Horse Centre. Many have been physically and mentally abused. Some were abandoned in water-logged fields, sheds or outhouses left tethered, thin and louse-ridden, in car parks‘They call them “lawn-mowers” but they’re not even supposed to eat much grass,’ says Tammy. ‘Some people might take them out for a walk on a lead, like a dog. But lots didn’t bother.’The fact is that Shetlands couldn’t be less suited to suburban life. They’re designed to roam remote Scottish islands, foraging for seaweed, scrub and thin, marine grass — not be idling in suburban back gardens. ‘The poorer the grass, the happier they are,’ says Tammy.While small in stature, they need lots of exercise and space — the same as a fully-grown horse — or they soon become overweight with diabetes and joint problems.Some become so fat that their legs can no longer support them and they have to be put to sleep.The dust before the storm: Huge cloud of red dirt looms over...\u0027What\u0027s useless and has eight legs? Your team!\u0027 Lord Sugar...Share this articleLaminitis, which is incredibly painful, can be fatal and, at the least, will need to be managed for the pony’s entire life. They should live for about 40 years (the oldest Shetland on record is 54). But as a result of the unregulated overbreeding to make them still smaller, they end up suffering from all sorts of horrific medical complaints.So the vicious circle continues. Treated like pets — given sweet morsels and dragged about on leads — they can quickly become difficult and prone to kicking and biting.Children, of course, outgrow them. They suffer endless health problems, yet few owners are happy to pay £45 a month to insure them for vets’ bills. As Tammy says, Shetlands are cheeky and wilful — ‘some people would say stubborn’.And they’re strong — they were originally bred to carry farmers across the Shetland Isles.While a super-cute, teeny young horse can go for up to £3,000, an unloved older horse with laminitis and diabetes has no resale value.The market is saturated so many end up as dog food. The lucky ones find themselves in rescue centres such as Munchkins. Tammy has been horse-mad since childhood, but it was the horsemeat scandal (when it was revealed that meat products in supermarkets routinely contained horsemeat) in 2013 that galvanised her to set up Munchkins.The setting is spectacular — 12 acres of Devon pasture owned by Tammy and her husband Paul, 65, a former maths teacher who had hoped to enjoy a relaxing retirement of golfing and gardening.          An Amazon advert showing a tiny pony that helped spark a craze. Miniature Shetlands are just the latest in a long line of animals to be catastrophically overbred to satisfy human fads and fashionsInstead, the couple — and their team of volunteers — regularly work 16-hour days coaxing their teeny charges back to life, grooming them, taking their pulses every morning, dishing out medication and monitoring their health. The steeds are kept on short, thin grass, taught to forage again, encouraged to walk and graze together.‘They’re herd animals — they love to interact and make friends. They need the company,’ says Tammy.They also have regular sessions with an equine behavioural expert, who seems to work wonders with broken spirits.Bruno, a chestnut with flaxen mane and tail, had terrible behavioural problems when he arrived – constantly rearing up on his hind legs to kick and bite — but is now contently chomping away.January, a piebald, who stamps, swirls and kicks her heels up in a flurry of excitement, was skeletal, louse-ridden and terrified when she was rescued from a field that also contained a dead foal and emaciated horses.But not all are success stories, yet.Rocky, a chestnut with liver problems who barely reaches up to my hip, is still not a horse you’d risk standing behind.          Jane Fryer goes the Munchkins rescue centre in Devon, to see the miniature horses there. Smaller breed are being neglected and abandoned as owners believe their small size means they are easier to care forBirthdays for the animals are marked with home-baked equine-friendly ginger cookies. Come Christmas, the tinsel will go up and, thanks to a charity lucky dip, all ponies will receive presents — halters, hay-bags, polos.I’d be astonished if any pony would ever want to leave, but the Holy Grail for Tammy and her team is to rehabilitate and make room for more.While some will never be fit enough, physically and emotionally, so far more than 30 ponies have been happily rehomed. The TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who lives nearby, has one.Towards the end of my visit, an emergency call is received about three ponies discovered cooped up in a lorry container in Kent with an Alsatian dog.It’s a long drive from Dorset to Kent, but let’s hope that somehow, they find their way to this little corner of equine heaven where they will be loved, cared for and, most of all, respected.If only they hadn’t had to endure such torture in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"Theresa vows clampdown companies charge loyal customers more","story":"    The Prime Minister (pictured) devoted a large section of her conference speech at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham to fixing \u0027broken markets\u0027 so they work in the interests of ordinary peopleClaiming refunds for delayed or cancelled trains to be done...Three in four cancer patients to get early diagnosis within...‘She left behind her so much joy\u0027: Touching legacy of...Share this articleIt comes after a review was announced last week into ending rip-off fees for long-standing customers, who often pay more than those who switch suppliers regularly.

And that simple fact is pregnant with a much wider significance.For the past three months, an existential battle has raged inside the Conservative Party to decide on what terms Britain should quit the EU in six months’ time.\u0027Now is the moment to chuck Chequers\u0027: Tory activists go...RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: Roll up, roll up for the Festival of...Share this articleMrs May and her allies have pushed for the so-called Chequers solution, meaning that Britain would retain strong trading links to Europe in return for surrendering an important element of national sovereignty, such as remaining under the aegis of the European Court of Justice.But her Conservative opponents have promoted the so-called Canada Plus alternative, meaning a looser trading relationship with the compensating advantage that Britain takes full control of all our own laws.Until yesterday, it looked as if Mr Johnson and Canada Plus were winning, while Mrs May’s Chequers deal was being written off as defunct and terminally useless by many observers.As recently as Tuesday, in a charismatic speech, Boris Johnson gained huge applause from an enthralled audience of Conservative activists when he demanded that the Government should ‘Chuck Chequers’.Mr Johnson threw down the gauntlet to Mrs May. Yesterday, the Prime Minister picked it up and hurled it back.          If Boris Johnson’s Brexiteers do manage to assemble the 48 signatures required to call a vote of no-confidence in the Prime Minister when Parliament returns, it won’t do them much goodShe used a certain amount of sleight of hand. She did not use the word ‘Chequers’ once in her speech, perhaps fearing the reaction in the hall.Crucially, however, she did not make a single substantive concession to her Tory opponents over her negotiating plans.Indeed, she eloquently defended her commitment to no border controls in Ireland, and also frictionless trade for British manufacturing goods with Europe. It was a remarkable achievement to make these unpopular arguments and still get a standing ovation from the Tory conference.I believe that from now on, voters are likely to look very differently at the Prime Minister. In recent months she has too often looked more and more like a hapless victim rather than the architect of events.No longer. Indeed Mrs May has been through so much and been written off so often that she is now gaining self-assurance and respect because she is a grizzled survivor.Yesterday also helped remedy another long-term problem which she has until now been unable to solve: her seeming shortage of any definitive political personality.That was remedied when she displayed her humanity with a deeply moving passage describing the death of a goddaughter from cancer.AssuranceAs for her dance up to the podium to the tune of Abba’s Dancing Queen, that will never be forgotten. As with her two dance performances in Africa during the summer, there was a cheerful acknowledgement that she is not a slick or cool political performer, and never will be.But her willingness to gamely send herself up has endeared her to many. Mrs May has announced herself at long last.Admittedly, there were dull passages, which lost momentum long before the end. I also believe she was wrong to announce the end of austerity, which played into Labour hands by subliminally reminding people of the Left’s mantra that the Tories are the party of ‘savage cuts’.The fact is that austerity never truly happened in Britain — and certainly nothing like on the scale of continental Europe — and Jeremy Corbyn will see yesterday’s announcement of various spending splurges as a vindication of Labour calls for extra public borrowing.It is not clear where the money is coming from, and it places constraints on Chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of his Budget later this month. Nevertheless, this speech was a great improvement on everything that has come before. There was a new wisdom and assurance.Whereas two years ago she notoriously attacked ‘citizens of nowhere’, yesterday she spoke a different language, urging ‘moderation and patriotism, not nationalism’.Whereas last year she launched an assault on business worthy of Corbyn, this was a robustly pro-business speech in the Conservative Party tradition.If she had been able to put in as strong a performance before, today’s political environment would be very different.Up till now there has been a tendency to view Theresa May as a stop-gap Prime Minister — think Gordon Brown after Tony Blair. But yesterday she took a giant step to being viewed as a genuine premier in her own right.Of course there is a long way to go. Next month’s negotiations with Europe will be brutal. There is no guarantee at all that European leaders will sign up to Theresa May’s vision of Britain post-Brexit.Moreover, it is important to remember that the most dangerous time for Tory leaders has never been the annual party conference. The grassroots are generally too loyal and even deferential.The truly dangerous time comes in late October and November when Parliament has returned.Remember how Maggie Thatcher was greeted by powerful chants of ‘ten more years’ at the 1990 conference — but voted out of office by her own MPs in the Commons a mere six weeks later. And Mrs May still has to work out how she will get her plan for Europe through Parliament.Despite yesterday’s success, she still can’t rely on the support of all her own MPs — far from it. The Brexiteers are still out there and waiting to make their move.Her leader’s speech did contain a fascinating clue to the strategy that she may yet be obliged to adopt, and the problems that lie ahead.It contained more praise for Labour figures than any Tory conference speech by any Tory leader. There were tributes for Neil Kinnock, Jo Cox, Jim Callaghan, Clem Attlee.Even Labour’s clueless Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott was the recipient of blandishments. So were Labour backbenchers who refuse to serve in the Shadow Government in what was dubbed ‘the Jeremy Corbyn party’.UndefeatedMrs May is making an icy political calculation. She reckons that she may well have to rely on Labour votes in the Commons when her Chequers deal comes to the crunch in two months’ time. She is preparing the way by sucking up to them in public.Nevertheless, the Prime Minister has crossed one massive hurdle in her battle to take Britain out of Europe. Ahead of this week’s Tory conference, even loyalists such as former leader Michael Howard were doubting her prospects of survival, while some in Downing Street were in despair.Now Mrs May is making plans to hold a Festival of Britain in 2022 — the year the next election is due to be fought. This is a signal she plans not only to see through Brexit, but also to fight the next election.If she has her way this battle-hardened, bruised but so far undefeated Prime Minister aims to be around for a great deal longer than her critics have bargained for. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/11/50EA4D1B00000578-0-image-m-13_1538474569386.jpg","title":"Fish lovers told turn backs squid favour pollock","story":"    The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) has published data today to its Good Fish Guide, detailing the most sustainable fishes to eat in the UK.

The original Victorian fabric and details of the building will also be restored.The redevelopment was applauded by Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, who said play was a serious business. “As well as having fun, play is how children discover the world around them, develop their creativity, learn new skills, and grow in confidence into rounded adults.“That’s why I’m so pleased the V\u0026ampA Museum of Childhood is being redeveloped so that generations of children will continue to take advantage of new and exciting spaces where they can use their imaginations to play and to learn.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ed568df91589021f8dfcb5c30a589bd5f8d6521/0_312_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8784fffd95219f87618ab38fa22a13f8","title":"the aftermath of hurricane florence in pictures","story":"Weeks after Hurricane Florence hit the Carolinas, its impact is still being felt.

But who could do a better job?In an image that will endure for as long as she is remembered, Theresa May danced in to deliver her conference speech in Birmingham. Wisely, she chose Dancing Queen to show off her moves rather than Waterloo, which would have sent the wrong message. But the deeper message to her party was to get behind her. It was Take a Chance On Me – the remix.Politicians and the media are often accused, with some justice, of making too much of leaders’ conference speeches, of setting the bar impossibly high for ordeals that are over-interpreted for a few hours, then quickly forgotten. For Tory leaders, as for Labour ones, the lovingly honed speeches then merge into a morass of semi-remembered oratorical stodge from which the occasional zinger – in the Tory case about ladies not being for turning, quiet men turning up the volume or countries being at ease with themselves – still catches the sunlight in the memory.The verbal flourishes of May’s third conference speech as leader will not glint for as long as the memories of her first two still do. In 2016 she recklessly attacked the half of the country who voted remain in the Brexit referendum for preferring to be “citizens of nowhere”, destroying at a stroke any possibility that she might speak to both sides of a deeply wounded country. Last year, meanwhile, was memorable only for the excruciating ordeal of her coughing, the collapsing letters of the backdrop, and the security breach that allowed a joker to hand her a P45 dismissal notice.Yet her 2018 speech may outlive both of its predecessors in importance. It was a speech in which the prime minister said what she meant and meant what she said. It combined a call for unity behind her battered-but-unbowed Brexit strategy – which will have been heeded by almost no one in the hall – with an emphatic attempt to pitch the Tory party’s tent on the vacant but unfashionable centre ground of British politics. The “decent, moderate and patriotic” post-austerity party that she conjured in her speech – a party for everyone, “with nowhere left behind” – is beyond question a dream close to her heart.But May has been here before. Actions have not lived up to the words. Two years ago, she stood on the steps of Downing Street and promised action against the burning injustices of the 21st century. After that, however, nothing much happened. Then, a year ago, she launched a general election manifesto that promised to govern from the mainstream, asserting the good that government can do. This too came to nothing. In both cases, Brexit loomed too large, and May had too little authority to turn words into actions.Is there any reason now to assume that this besieged and emotionally remote leader of a deeply ided party will do any better the third time around? It would be a bold punt to say yes. Many Tory activists are opposed to her policy on Brexit. Large parts of the party have already written her off. She struggles to control a hung parliament. And a shameless successor waits impatiently in the wings. Less than an hour before May danced on to the stage in Birmingham, a Tory MP submitted a letter calling on her to resign.These are not propitious circumstances for May to become, the third time around, the leader she still evidently dreams of being. Yet I have written before that Theresa May is too easily written off. A year ago, after the 2017 election, George Osborne dismissed her as a dead woman walking. Many in Birmingham this week took the same view. Yet May still has her walking boots on. It would be astonishing if she fights the next election as Conservative leader. Yet the cabinet ministers who say she could last until 2021 could still be right.May has a few things on her side, that cannot be simply ignored. First, she is the incumbent. The Tory party punishes incumbent leaders when it is self-evidently in their interest to dismiss them – as it did to Margaret Thatcher in 1990. But that is not the case right now. The Brexit timetable, which will be intense for the next six months, works in favour of May and against any attempt to hold a leadership contest, especially if she gets a deal with the EU. Although one MP called for her to go, there were none of the government resignations this week that were being talked about beforehand.Second, any Brexit deal she gets through parliament strengthens her. Too many Tories assume that, as soon as May gets a Brexit deal – if she does – the party can do what Britain did to Churchill in 1945, and say: thank you – and now, goodbye. Looking at the strains on May’s face these days, she could easily be tempted to quit then. But May would also be the Tory leader who had delivered Brexit – an act that, whatever its other effects, would surely impress leavers. At the same time, judging by her centrist speech in Birmingham, she might well seem the least worst leader, from a remain point of view, in Brexit’s immediate aftermath.Fourth, she is lucky in her challengers. Boris Johnson has immense ambition and formidable party support, as his speech in Birmingham this week showed. But the old indulgence towards him among Tory MPs has disappeared. The polling shows no party advantage from him replacing May. Former allies say he is no longer the party’s future. Even the Daily Mail criticised him yesterday. His main liberal rival, Ruth Davidson, remains committed to running in the Scottish elections in 2021 and not moving to Westminster. The cabinet hopefuls, of whom Sajid Javid had the best conference, continue to wait on events, though a dozen hats are likely to be thrown in the ring when there is a contest.May is not in the clear. Talks with the EU could implode. She could lose Commons votes. The Tories could explode. The DUP could turn against her. May’s bunker mentality and her lack of emotional intelligence may simply prove too destructive. But as Gordon Brown (who as the newly published 2017 general election study points out, has more in common with May than either of them might wish to admit) once said: “This is no time for a novice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b779874211427d16cdbb54ed6dc12c177a79d7e5/0_0_650_396/master/650.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=05c09921b089dbad78b178e850e52a14 930w","title":"late night comics trevor noah stephen colbert kavanaugh","story":"Late-night comics discussed the supreme court nominee drama and examined Stephen Miller’s immigration policiesLate-night hosts discussed the latest news to suggest that Brett Kavanaugh wasn’t being totally honest about his past of heavy drinking.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about the importance of honesty in this particular line of work. “Along with a complexion that looks good in black, honesty is the thing you most want in a supreme court judge,” he said.The latest strike against the supreme court nominee concerns his drinking. During his hearing, Kavanaugh denied that he had ever had a problem but a resurfaced police report reveals that he was involved in a bar fight while in college.“Kavanaugh might not be fit to sit on the supreme court but we should nominate him for the next season of Jersey Shore,” Noah joked.He continued: “Do you know how bad a fight has to be for the police to get called on a white guy?”The specifics of the case involve Kavanaugh reportedly throwing his drink in someone’s face after incorrectly assuming it was the lead singer of UB40. “If you’re throwing a drink in someone’s face because they’re not the lead singer of UB40 then you’re either someone who drunk a shit ton or you’re just a crazy person,” he said.On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert also discussed the same report. “If you’re familiar with UB40, you be at least 40,” he joked.Colbert continued: “Nothing could be more stereotypically college in the 1980s. What’s next? Kavanaugh teamed up with James Spader to steal Molly Ringwald’s underwear and throw it into the pool where Phoebe Cates is sunbathing while John Cusack holds a boombox over his head screaming ‘I want my MTV’?”Speaking to the press yesterday, Donald Trump said that lying to Congress is problematic and while doing an impression of him, Colbert riffed: “Lying is kind of my thing and you can’t take assaulting women because I got that too.”On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host decided to look at the work of Stephen Miller (“Trump’s favourite ghoul”) and his cruel immigration policies, something that has received less coverage since the supreme court controversy.While he has been working to crack down on illegal immigration, he has also been trying to minimise legal immigration as well by making it harder for people to receive benefits from the government. Meyers played a clip on Fox \u0026amp Friends where a pundit claims reports of families avoiding government health funding is planted by the left to make Trump seem racist. “The left doesn’t exactly have to do anything to make Trump seem more racist,” Meyers countered, before listing off evidence.Meyers believes that Trump and Miller have two key things in common: “They’re both racist and hate poor people.”He also expressed his surprise over Miller’s age. “It is hilarious that that guy is 33,” he joked. Even his hair doesn’t want to be associated with him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a704c0523025175e18b8ab39aa469c0db5292c15/0_0_3949_2370/master/3949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c638e6a08b5fe2db2ad1c202a5d8f6e3","title":"this drought is different its drier and hotter and getting worse","story":"On the land and in the towns they’re affected to varying degrees some find it harder to cope. But they all agree something has changedIf you don’t fully appreciate the complexity of rural communities, farmer Peter Schmidt is not the sort of bloke you would be expecting in the Mulga Lands. His place is 21,000 hectares – 52,000 acres in the old money – and his family have been there since his grandfather selected blocks in the 1890s. The closest town is Wyandra, a blip on the highway on the way to Cunnamulla from Charleville – a drive that reveals the disused fences of smaller blocks long abandoned as unsustainable.Schmidt though is still at his homestead at Alawoona, its sheds and outbuildings surrounded by a metre-high levee, standing like a bad joke in their sixth year of drought. He put it in after the 2012 flood, which washed a foot of water through his house. Problem is, that flood heralded the start of the dry and it pretty much hasn’t rained since. He jokes with station hand Joe that he cursed the place and might have to break the levee to bring on the rain. But far from being a man of superstition, Schmidt is a rural scientist, with two masters degrees – one each in rural education and cattle behaviour. He has a softly spoken manner and a sense of humour born in the Mulga.“We’re mad here, we are in the most unreliable area, the most unreliable climate in the most unreliable continent,” he says.“Well, it’s unreliably reliable,” says his partner, Kathryn.Schmidt first started thinking about climate change after seeing a program on the astronaut Neil Armstrong who, before he went to space, thought the earth’s atmosphere was like the peel of an orange. In the pictures of space, Schmidt could see that the thickness of the atmosphere was more like an onion skin, and it stayed with him.“I kept that in the back of my mind and then you hear things like there’s a million new cars put on the road every year in Australia belching out exhaust fumes – and these coal-fired things – something has to happen in that very confined space of the atmosphere. I think it’s happening.”It is the middle of winter when we drop in, and though the fine day stretches over the place like a shroud, there is a chilly wind that blows through the mulga. Schmidt welcomes us into a small closed kitchen as he loads some old gidgee (Acacia cambagei or stinking wattle) into the wood stove and offers us a coffee.Schmidt has lived through many droughts but it’s the big ones he remembers – 1958, 1965, 1983. While southern Australia suffered through the Millennium drought during the noughties, up in the Mulga Lands, Schmidt says it was “dry for eight years in a row”.Every one is different but this time Schmidt has noticed one change from previous droughts has been the higher temperature.“The essential thing was there were two or three periods there where the temperature was above 40C for 15 days in a row and it just sapped all the moisture out of the soil,” Schmidt says. “That’s the difference between this drought and the others.”He had 100mm on the backblocks of his place last November, 59mm in March and very little since then.Drought has long been a part of the Australian climate and features in Indigenous stories and history. Indigenous agricultural and land management practices, documented by historians such as Bruce Pascoe and Bill Gammage, consider drought as a subjective notion – that is, it’s a state of mind. This is replicated among today’s landholders, reflected back in comments like these: “the only thing we know about drought is that it will end”. That is, it is a period that needs to be managed, like any other. We will explore more of this thinking about drought in the last of this series.Then there is the scientific definition of drought. According to the Bureau of Meterology, drought is serious or severe rainfall deficiency – essentially a period of prolonged dryness.Many farmers have taken advantage of rain when it does come, by making hay and stockpiling other fodder. Many are careful to protect their pastures and therefore their soil by selling or locking up livestock and feeding – a practice known as drought lotting – in dry times. Others over-graze and accelerate land degradation. This explains why driving through the countryside you can see one side of a fence is as bare as a board and the other with foot-high pasture. And yet, no matter how much you prepare, it is hard to manage for seven lean years with a business, bills to pay and an average farm debt. Land management is key.“It’s so much easier to be a good manager in a wet year,” Augathella farmer Rachelle Cameron says. “There is grass everywhere and no stress.”Four hours north of Wyandra, Louise and Andrew (Marto) Martin are sheep growers on the Mitchell Grass plains near Tambo, 860kms north-west of Brisbane. Looking out over the high grass, it doesn’t look too bad, certainly not the desert landscape pictures that metropolitan audiences are used to in drought. Macfarlane station is on an ancient inland sea – the Martin’s fossil collection contains ammonites and Huon pine, spat out of the black soil plains that expand and contract depending on the water content.Both Martins work the farm, while Andrew is also mayor of the Blackall-Tambo region. This year they got a bit of autumn rain and made 200 bales of hay. They reduced their stocking rate to match the season, as much as is possible with lambing ewes. They’re not in favour of what Marto calls “agrarian socialism”, believing that subsidies create dependency.“The best way of dealing with drought is accepting you are going to have one,” Andrew says. He takes the longer view on climate, which he describes as always changing, while Louise echoes Schmidt’s experience that higher temperatures have been a feature of the latest drought.“It’s quite unusual to get over 40C here but this last summer and the last couple of summers have been so scorchingly hot,” she says. “You can see the water being sucked out of the dams, sucked out of the soil, sucked out of my life and you can’t plan for that.Karen and Bill McLennan and their son Michael are in the Mulga Lands on the highway to Roma, just outside Charleville. Their ersification plan was an olive plantation – Sommariva Olives – made into oil, soap, tapenades and other products. They are trying to stay agile, in the government’s words, to drought-proof. Bill and Karen also work in the panel-beating business in Charleville through the week they spread themselves thin in an effort to survive the climate and the conditions.Karen describes the good times, when the grass is above their knees, but looking out from their back deck off the olive shed, it is all mulga and red dirt. The olives get enough water to yield a crop every second year. She describes a life that is filled with work, in the panel shop, in the olive shed, in the mulga. The olives were to be the retirement plan, but their oil won awards and it has increased the cashflow in dry times.“You do get a bit sick of it, she says. “You often say, I want to get out. I have had enough, I just want to get out. But you can’t really sell when it’s this dry, you have to wait for the rain, and then hopefully, if you want to get out, you get out then when it looks nice. But probably everyone else thinks the same way so the market will be flooded.”They find government policies frustrating, the rhetoric encouraging farmers to ersify while erecting hurdles, or as Michael says, “government policy is actually adverse to ersification, it’s crazy”.Karen applied for some assistance to restructure their finances and was knocked back on account of their income from the panel-beating shop.“Like my husband says, when we are in drought, this whole area is in drought,” she says. “Our business in town struggles as well, because people can’t spend money in town. We get hit there as well as out here.”Pressure has increased on the family after the bank revalued their properties and stock as a result of the downturn in conditions, which changes the interest payments.Like all the farmers we speak to, they appreciate the city’s donations, though they have not received anything. Hay is tricky, given once you start feeding cattle, you have to keep going. One or two bales will not last long.One of the big movements in farming practice over recent years is towards grazing practices that respond to climate rather than keeping a set number of stock no matter what the climate. There are a number of farmers now who sell down stock and close down for dry periods but this requires a certain equity level. For the McLennans, it is not an option.“It’s easy to say you need to destock going into a drought, but you can’t,” Michael says. “The cost of getting into one of these places, you have to keep producing because if you don’t, how do you meet your loans? What is your income? In drought, costs go up, but cattle prices go down because no one else can buy for the next year.”North west of the McLennans, Doug and Rachelle Cameron live on the old station of Nive Downs, originally over 738 square miles with its own post office and general store. It was split up in the 1960s and the couple have been on 34,000 acres north of Augathella since 2004.Conditions were pretty good for the first few years, then it flooded before sliding into drought. They have cut their herd down from 1,300 to 900 and are preparing for the possibility they will not get their usual summer rain. In a normal year, the Cameron family gets 19 inches of annual rainfall on Nive Downs, yet near the end of August they have only had six. Talk turns to what normal is.The Camerons are trying to increase cash flow by ersifying into production of their Nive Beef jerky. Doug hit on it after a cattle price crash due to the 2011 temporary live export ban. At a roadhouse on the way back from the saleyards, he saw a 25g packet of beef jerky for $5 after he just sold cattle for $50 a head.Doug was sick of being a price taker. “It didn’t matter what I did to the cattle – we could have the best genetics, the best everything – but outside influences just crushed us. I thought maybe we can make something out of the jerky and set the price.”Around Augathella, they grow their haystack in summer and cattle eat it down in winter. By autumn, they know whether they will have enough feed to get through the winter, and for the past five years it has never been enough, so they have sold off cattle.Farmers are not the only ones to suffer in drought. Dave* lost his job on a big cotton farm in a small northern NSW town when the drought started to bite. There was not enough water and the farmer cut back his cropping program. Like many farm workers, a cottage was part of his package. So when he lost his job, Dave and wife Margie* also lost their house.There was no redundancy package because the employer was not large enough. Dave was reeling from the job loss but Margie got active. The couple, in their late 50s, were carrying a bit of debt from the last drought when they were left unpaid for contracting work. So while looking for a new home, Margie also contacted their bank to apply for hardship provisions which the bank duly provided. But when a good friend gave them some money to tide them over, the bank dropped the hardship provision.Margie applied to Centrelink for Newstart, but given the couple have had various micro businesses, the application process was arduous to prove they had no hidden assets. She also contacted high profile drought charities who told her because they were not farmers, they could not help. Sixteen weeks after losing their job and home, they were still waiting for Newstart.The only assistance they have received is from the Country Womens Association, which pays up to $3000 for household expenses such as fuel, power, insurance and the like. Another city based charity arrived with groceries, lining up donated goods like a supermarket at a local hall.“The government needs to look after people who become unemployed with the drought,” Margie said. “There is no focus on contractors, the small businesses, it’s hard to get Centrelink assistance and those people end up leaving town.”The dry weather also places pressure on regular social events such as picnic races, campdrafts and other gatherings, which are important economically and socially. At a time when people need to keep an eye on others, the usual events can disappear from a town calendar, having a material effect on the state of mind of its inhabitants.Christine McDougall is the director for mental health, alcohol and other drugs for the South West Hospital and Health Service under the Queensland government. Based in Roma, her patch is one of the largest health services in the state, covering 320,000 square kilometres, but there are only 29,000 people scattered across that vast “corner country”. McDougall has been a mental health nurse since 1974 but she says it makes her cry to drive around Charleville and Cunnamulla and see the effect on the community, first of the floods of 2012, which wrecked the soil and land, and now the latest drought.There are no mental health beds in the south west, and people are transported by the Royal Flying Doctors Service if necessary. The service aims to keep people in their own community, using local hospitals and providing full support as much as possible, via telehealth consultations and regular visits by clinicians.“We try to keep as many people as we can out here because it’s traumatic going into hospital in an aeroplane,” says McDougall. “We can’t make it rain but we can keep them going until it rains – we hope – and if they get the money from the government and all these donations coming, we can keep the social and emotional stuff going.”A straight-talking dairy farmer’s daughter from Gippsland in Victoria, she presses the point that women are farmers too.“People think of farmers and they have an image of a man you ask women what they do and they say we are farmers. They know everything that is happening on the place. They are as likely to get as depressed, miserable or suicidal as the next man.”Three years ago the state government created positions for Regional Adversity Integrated Care Clinicians (Raiccs) to cope with drought and disaster. The approach was to get to as many people as possible, no matter how remote and no matter how few people turn up. The number of suicides has dropped in the region from 13 to 4 over the past two years.“I have not forgotten anyone I have looked after who has taken their life by suicide, you never forget them, and you always think what if I had done this or that – you don’t know,” she says.“We have to acknowledge too we never know the ones we stop. It’s no small thing to go from 13 to 4, given the way it ripples through the community.”If you need support call Lifeline on 131114*names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54085b8502aec472737d67284987cd2177adf83/0_0_1544_927/master/1544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a43ac26e47f1dfde52c2460068d14f","title":"paris fashion week springsummer 2019 16 key shows in pictures","story":"From Dior’s modern dance performance and Maison Margiela’s gender-fluid show to the beach set at Chanel, the Observer’s fashion editors Jo Jones and Helen Seamons pick the highlights from the collections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d65afa52249cc70805e423f528b6981e9ae170b/0_210_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86ca95edbfee6e7cbe6b055f4046095f","title":"blue iguana review sam rockwell","story":"This middling crime comedy, starring Sam Rockwell, is overly pleased with itself but has colourful turns by an assortment of British character actorsFor those few unfortunate souls who may have seen the painfully unfunny black comedy Mr Right, in which the always watchable Sam Rockwell starred as a lovable, semi-hunky hitman opposite Anna Kendrick, this film offers a traumatic trigger. Once again, Rockwell stars as a tough guy for hire – not a hitman, exactly, though he ends up killing lots and lots of people. This time he plays opposite up-and-coming actor Phoebe Fox (The Hollow Crown), who is also, like Kendrick was, a good actor trapped in a middling to poor film. And once again, it is a story seemingly meant to be funny but only fitfully successful in this mission, and way too pleased with its own brand of deadpan wisecracking.Rockwell’s Eddie is an ex-con working in a diner in New York City with his comrade-in-crime Paul (Ben Schwartz, one of the movie’s brighter spots) when an English lawyer (Fox, sporting an up-do and glasses you just know are going to come off to reveal a hot babe by the end) walks through the door and offers them a job stealing a satchel full of MacGuffery in London. Naturally, it all goes wrong, and the principals end up in a scruffy-glam loft space spying on a pub full of thugs across the street.An assortment of interesting British character actors drop by to contribute colourful turns, some better than others. For instance, it’s always a treat to see arthouse siren of the 1980s Amanda Donohoe (Castaway) out and about, although one rather wishes she didn’t have to settle for the role of a Cockney hag, fake-leopard fur and all. Somewhat more successful is the offering from Simon Callow as a kindly uncle reporting the cuss-rich dialogue of the bad guys in a plummy voice. Indeed, there are enough well-landed gags to keep one entertained, but this feels like a film destined to be buried on Netflix after a brief career as in-flight entertainment.

But the artery-clogging result is deliciousIt is hard to imagine the size of the night out that led to the invention of the cheeseburger spring roll. It must have produced a hangover so monstrous that neither a Chinese takeaway nor a dirty burger alone could begin to solve it. A craving for junk and comfort so intense that someone must have deemed the burger’s bread – the bread! – too healthy, and conjured up an acceptable way to deep fry it instead.Whichever brave soul suffered for the concept, their work has not been in vain. At Manchester restaurant Solita, cheeseburger spring rolls are bestsellers (and as a place that has been known to put deep-fried lasagne burgers on the menu, they probably know what they are talking about when it comes to artery-clogging mashups). On the other side of the world, you can enjoy a platter of cheeseburger spring rolls at the Wharf hotel in Melbourne while sitting in your own private igloo, just to take the fusion element somewhere even more WTF. And at Disney World, the delicacy has earned itself a cult reputation, with some food bloggers celebrating when it returned to the Magic Kingdom’s menus.Quite where the idea came from is hard to trace, although it has been suggested that its roots may lie in post-second-world-war Japan, when US troops brought American staples to east Asia and they were absorbed into the country’s cuisine.I sample some at RedFarm, the famed New York dim sum spot that has just opened its first London restaurant. It is a place that likes to have fun with its food – one menu item consists of a sweet potato Pac-Man chasing four sumptuous prawn “ghost” dumplings, each one decorated with sesame seed eyes. Their cheeseburger spring roll, however, was apparently just the result of someone messing around in the kitchen while the restaurant prepared to open: “It was delicious, so we put it on the menu.”In some ways, the concept sounds unappealing and not one I would normally think to order. Perhaps it is the use of the word “cheeseburger”, a food item so perfectly judged that to dismantle it feels rather like making a collage out of the Birth of Venus. Ignore that term and there is no reason why a mixture of beef mince, onion and pickle wrapped in stringy cheese shouldn’t work as a spring-roll filling. RedFarm serves a pair of them (£10 as part of their dim sum menu) with a traditional burger sauce on the side for dipping.It is not so much more than the sum of its parts as exactly the sum of its parts – something delicious, combined with something else delicious, to make something that is roughly, by my mathematical calculations, twice as delicious. The crisp exterior works perfectly against the moist cheese and mince, while the pickles provide a satisfying acidic hit that cuts through the gluttony. I instantly want more, and this is after barely one cocktail – just imagine how good they could become as the night goes on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a5c097d3f87753d56bc15de93727814ad6a4603/0_1003_7982_4790/master/7982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fc9f5ef395205258e8df105b8f7dc03","title":"minestrone recipe rachel roddy beans","story":"This colourful minestrone, brimming with borlotti beans, is the perfect soup for bridging the seasonsBeans are energetic sorts. They are runners, climbers, crawlers or, in the case of borlotti, acrobatic in the way the older vines borlano (tumble) as they grow. My mum talks about the bean plants in her Dorset garden being vigorous and productive, and describes how they sometimes bolt, both beans and plant, making her full-of-beans grandchildren hopeful that they might have a stalk to climb and a giant to meet.Lately, one of the stalls on Testaccio market has been getting crates of fresh beans in their pods, called il fagiolo rosso rampicante, from Cuneo in Piedmont. Rampicante means climbing. I can’t get the word rampant out of my head, though – unrestrained, unbridled beans, redheads turning heads and stealing attention. Under their gorgeous mottled pods, they have rusty red streaks on cream-coloured skin, like borlotti. In fact, the stallholder, Marco, refers to them as borlotti. Another stall has beans with a darker mottle called borlotti lingua di fuoco, tongue of fire, while across the market ever-reliable Filippo calls the beans he grows on his land, slap-bang between Rome and Naples, simply fagioli.While the rampant ones from northern Italy are the plumpest and probably have the best flavour, all the varieties are delicious, each losing their ink splatters and turning dull brown as they simmer, but gaining a flavour and consistency somewhere between a roasted chestnut, a cannellini bean and a chickpea.In season from July until October November, the mottled bean family are an ingredient that bridges the seasons. When they first arrive in June, they fit easily into the rhythm of summer cooking. Podded and boiled until tender, they are good tossed with olive oil and herbs for serving beside meat or fish, mixed still-warm with a spoonful of pesto or handful of rocket Nigel Slater-style, a chopped tomato or a tin of tuna and sliced onion. As days get shorter and the months begin to end with “-ber”, borlotti become the backbone of stews and soups, first the brothy ones (which is the soup equivalent of acknowledging autumn, but refusing tights), then the thick or dense soups and minestra we make as the months roll on.The reason recipes described in person (ideally while you eat the thing in question) are often better than those in books is the idiosyncratic detail. Ten years on, I can still hear a friend telling me to start a minestrone by frying the Italian kitchen trinity (an onion, a carrot and a stick of celery, diced) in plenty of olive oil, with a pinch of salt to hasten away water, until they smell nice and look like a frosted bathroom window that a peeled, squashed tomato makes the soup blush and gives it a nice note of acidity that cooking fresh beans (1kg podded) or dried (250g soaked overnight) in two litres of water means you earn 1.5 litres of dodgy-looking, cloudy bean broth that tastes better than a stock cube. She was also the person who showed me to mix a chopped red chilli or dried red pepper flakes with olive oil in a bowl, then spoon a little over the finished dish. (This combats wind apparently.)In my September minestrone, I add a diced potato and courgette with the tomato, before the beans and their broth. You know best what you like, you could add pancetta to the foundations, garlic or rosemary, a squirt of concentrate rather than a whole tomato you could substitute pasta for potato, cannellini for borlotti. “Simmer until it is done,” said the same friend, “and keep tasting, but don’t poke a red chilli finger in your eye.”Serves 4-61kg fresh borlotti, podded, or 300g dried, soaked for 12 hours1 onion, peeled and diced1 stick of celery, diced1 carrot, peeled and diced1 garlic clove, choppedOlive oil1 medium tomato, peeled and diced2 courgettes, diced1 large potato, peeled and dicedA handful of baby spinach or herbsSalt and black pepperParmesan, gratedDried red chilli flakesCover the podded or driedsoaked beans withtwo litres of water, bring to the boil, then reduce and simmer until tender (30-40 minutes for fresh beans, 45 minutes to an hourfor dried).

Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes or until the vegetables are soft, adding a handful of spinach or herbs in the last few minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.To serve, make up a mixture of red chilli flakes and olive oil, then sprinkle each bowl with grated parmesan and one teaspoon of the chilli oil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/964760d1b6dad1b352c0dd46c5cf7929acde4bbd/0_168_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bb86e56df6333b7f4e7f7b4ecd0d516","title":"champions league roundup psg neymar thrashing","story":"• Neymar scores hat-trick for PSG in 6-1 rout of Red Star• Jadon Sancho provides assist in Dortmund victoryInternazionale came from behind to secure a 2-1 victory at PSV Eindhoven, with Mauro Icardi scoring the winner on the hour mark as the Italian side moved level on points with Barcelona in Group B.

It reverberated with a Neapolitan voice. Only they had cause to celebrate. Only their team delivered. Liverpool were silenced.A slender Napoli win courtesy of a 90th-minute winner may indicate misfortune for Jürgen Klopp’s team. The story of the contest was much different. Liverpool, not to put too fine a point on it, were unrecognisable. Uncharacteristically subdued, error‑strewn and on the back foot throughout, the visitors did not produce one shot on target against Carlo Ancelotti’s side and Lorenzo Insigne’s late winner was the least Napoli deserved. The momentum produced by that dramatic stoppage-time win against Paris Saint-Germain has been squandered by last season’s finalists.He had described Ancelotti as a “smart fox” and the three-times Champions League-winning coach lived up to the pre-match description. The Italian deployed a third centre‑back in his starting lineup, Nikola Maksimovic, to prevent a repeat of the 5-0 friendly defeat by Liverpool in Dublin in August an experience that Klopp insisted would have no influence on a competitive European tie.Ancelotti said: “We played with an extra central defender because Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah targeted our two centre-backs in the friendly. That’s what they do and it creates space for Roberto Firmino. We wanted to stop that and we did.”Napoli were the more threatening team throughout, too.The San Paolo may be crumbling in places but remains an atmospheric arena that can test seasoned Champions League travellers. Locals were queuing for the beat seats in the old house more than three hours before kick-off as Napoli endeavoured to capitalise on home advantage following a disappointing goalless draw at Red Star Belgrade. Not that it was full, however, and Liverpool’s difficulties were of their own making rather than any external noise.Naby Keïta replaced Jordan Henderson in the only change to the Liverpool team who drew at Chelsea on Saturday and set the tone with a series of misplaced passes during his 19 minutes on the pitch. Two mistakes almost led to clear chances for Insigne, who was denied one by Van Dijk’s interception and shot narrowly wide of Alisson’s far post after the £52.75m midfielder had sent a loose ball to Callejón.Keïta’s night was over minutes later when he injured his back in a collision with the matchwinner Insigne. The midfielder’s distress was obvious as he received lengthy treatment before going off. A worrying sight for Klopp, regardless of the Guinea captain’s difficult night on the ball, and cue for Henderson’s swift return.Liverpool’s problems were not confined to wayward passes in the heart of their midfield. Napoli regularly broke behind the outnumbered Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back. To the annoyance of the home crowd they were unable to capitalise because of a recurring fault – a dreadful final ball. When Arkadiusz Milik opted to find Insigne inside the penalty area rather than shoot, and overhit his pass straight out of play, the San Paolo howled in disapproval.Patience had been stretched by several similar errors although Milik was closest to opening the scoring in the first half when he turned Van Dijk on the penalty spot and tested Alisson with a rising shot.Milik forced Alisson into another sharp save early in the second half as Napoli restarted with an intensity and purpose that Liverpool lacked. The Poland international took aim from almost 30 yards with a low drive that Alisson blocked at full stretch to his left. Gomez was crucially on hand to clear before Insigne could snap up the rebound. From the subsequent corner Fabián Ruiz shot straight at Liverpool’s overworked keeper. The pressure was growing, as were the number of unforced errors from Liverpool.Van Dijk denied Insigne with a perfectly timed tackle at the near post after Milik released Mário Rui for an inviting cross from the left.Seconds later the Netherlands defender gifted possession to Milik inside the Liverpool area and was reprieved when the striker over‑elaborated yet again – prompting further derision from the Napoli crowd – and allowed Alexander‑Arnold to intercept.Alisson was not immune to errors in possession either, gifting the hosts the ball with one misplaced chip. Gomez helped retain parity with a goal-line clearance from Callejón but Dries Mertens, the Napoli substitute, should have opened the scoring when found unmarked inside the area by Rui’s delightful cross. Mertens volleyed against the bar instead and Liverpool appeared reprieved.It was a misconception. In the final minute Napoli broke down the right with Van Dijk dragged over to the touchline and Andy Robertson unable to catch Callejón’s run into the area. The cross eluded Liverpool’s retreating defence, Gomez lost Insigne and the striker slid in to convert. There could be no complaints."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b34d5aec0434ea7af370e5f551232f86bcd04a9f/0_101_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbaf0c6712fe751cb5ca5fa5b35e8bc5","title":"tottenham hotspur barcelona champions league match report","story":"For Tottenham it was a harsh lesson in the realities of the Champions League at the highest level. They found out here that it can be frightening at the top and, if anything, they probably got off lightly bearing in mind the long passages when Lionel Messi seemed utterly determined to leave the impression that, in their entire 136-year history, Spurs can never have encountered a man with his powers.Messi enforced the point by scoring a couple, hitting the post twice in quick succession, playing a key role in Barcelona’s other two goals and menacing his opponents with such brilliance it was bordering on absurd. Nobody should be surprised that panic set into the Spurs defence because, even by Messi’s standards, it was difficult to think there could be enough superlatives in existence to cover his mastery. Did Mauricio Pochettino’s players show him too much respect? Possibly. But the simple truth is there are times when it seems as though Barcelona’s No 10 might just be visiting this planet.It was certainly not an easy game to work out in light of the 20-minute period at 3-2 when Spurs, against all the odds, might have saved themselves. They were emboldened by goals from Harry Kane and Érik Lamela and there was a prolonged onslaught from the home team before Messi settled it in the 89th minute. The idea, however, that Spurs might have pinched a draw felt almost bewildering given the exhilarating spells when Barça bewitched Wembley and the various points, at 2-0 and 3-1, when it would not have been a surprise if the game turned into a rout. Barça were both brilliant and vulnerable. But they were so superior, overall, that nobody could possibly argue the victory was undeserved. It was merely a surprise they restricted themselves to only four goals.Hugo Lloris Ill-advised bolt from the line on the opening goal, spread further panic with another one in the second half. 4Kieran Trippier Will feel he should have cut out Messi’s pass on first goal. Hands full with Coutinho. 5Toby Alderweireld Booked early on after being tricked by Coutinho, he suffered as Barcelona turned the screw. 5Dávinson Sánchez Guilty of lapses and continues to look vulnerable to the high ball over his shoulder. 4Ben Davies Thankless assignment with Messi roaming off his side. Stuck to his guns. 5Harry Winks Felt the pressure of Barcelona’s press. Tried to put fizz into his passes. Tough evening. 6Victor Wanyama First Champions League start since December 2016, might be a while before he gets another. Chased shadows. 4Luca Moura Denied space, unable to show electric pace but almost conjured stunning late equaliser. 5Érik Lamela Worked to inject urgency and creativity. Carried physical fight. Assist for Kane. Deserved luck on his goal. 8Son Heung-min Struggled to make any impression. Had the ball in the net in the first half but the whistle had gone. 5Harry Kane Fed off scraps but showed class and composure for goal. Refused to accept defeat. 7Ratings by David HytnerSpurs will certainly have a better idea now that, with Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen among their absentees, they come up a long way short. Messi’s ability to create his own space, a talent he does not relinquish even when he is down to walking speed, made him the central figure and the home team did not get anyone close enough to disturb the rhythm.It was a masterclass and amid the disappointment of back-to-back Champions League defeats the Spurs supporters must appreciate it was a privilege to see a man taking the sport to its highest levels. This might not be the most beautifully assembled Barça in their modern history but as long as their artillery includes the five-times Ballon d’Or winner they will have the capacity to make even the most proficient opponents question themselves.At this level, however, Spurs will also have to learn they cannot expect to get very far by defending as obligingly as they did for at least two of the goals. At one point late on Kieran Trippier could be seen arguing with Eric Dier, a substitute, about the chaos in Tottenham’s back line. Trippier was one of the players at fault for Barça’s final goal and the fit-again Hugo Lloris made a bad decision to leave his goal-line, trying to intercept one of Messi’s expertly weighted passes, before Jordi Alba reached the ball first to set up Philippe Coutinho for the opener, with the goalkeeper stranded and barely 90 seconds on the clock.Perhaps the credit should go to the Barça attackers for inspiring that kind of trepidation. Luis Suárez may not have scored an away goal in the Champions League since September 2015 but his ability to deceive defenders with his body movement, even without touching the ball sometimes, helped tee up Messi for both his goals. Arthur, another of Barça’s Brazilians, also caught the eye and Ivan Rakitic’s goal to make it 2-0 was the outstanding moment of a thrilling night.Marc-André Ter Stegen Made a one-handed save to keep out a deflected Lamela cross. He could do nothing on the goals. 7Nélson Semedo Has pace to burn and showed confidence on the ball. Beaten too easily by Kane on goal. 6Gerard Piqué After three error-strewn games in La Liga, he looked a bit more convincing. Stayed tight to Kane. 7Clement Lenglet At fault for Lamela’s goal, which deflected in off him. Made a vital late block to deny Lucas. 6Jordi Alba Pressed high to provide a potent outlet on the left. Laid on three of the goals. 8Ivan Rakitic His goal looked better with each replay. Sumptuous technique. Assured in possession. 8Sergio Busquets Booked for cynical foul on the breaking Lamela. Difficult to argue with much of his positioning. 7Arthur Preferred in the lineup to Ousmane Dembélé, showed flickers of skill. Hard to dispossess. 7Lionel Messi Extraordinary in tight spaces. Shimmered with menace. Hit post twice before finding range. 9Luis Suárez Superb dummies key to both Messi goals. Part of a slick attacking unit. 8Philippe Coutinho Showed his twinkle toes. Lovely finish for goal and most remarkable of assists for Rakitic. 8Ratings by David HytnerRakitic was 25 yards out and the ball was bouncing towards him so high it needed a shot of remarkable control to keep it down. It was a lesson in the art of volleying a ball, a firecracker of a shot that flew through the air, skimmed off the post and speared into the net.Messi was at the heart of everything and it was difficult not to fear for Spurs, 2-0 down, when a slaloming run at the start of the second half took the Argentinian 40 yards only for his shot to thud against a post. A few minutes later Messi did precisely the same again. He was toying with Spurs and it must have been startling for the home supporters to see the little genius at work.Except that was the point at which the complexion of the evening changed. When Kane created an angle inside the penalty area to fire a splendid shot past the away team’s goalkeeper, Marc-André ter Stegen, it felt like a deception that there could be only one goal in it. Perhaps it riled Messi. Three minutes later he picked out Alba on his left. The ball came back his way, Suárez let it go and Messi steered his shot past Lloris.Still Spurs were not finished. The second half was not even at its midway point when Lamela’s shot deflected in off Clément Lenglet. Spurs were also entitled to feel aggrieved that Kane was not awarded a penalty, but it was fitting that Messi was to have the decisive say, rolling the ball past Lloris after some wretched defending in the home ranks. It was true: Spurs have been playing football since 1882 and in all that time, all those thousands of games, they may never have come up against anyone better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

The British are ready. Everyone is ready. All sides are up for a deal, but we need this to happen behind closed doors with an end to the leaks.”There are 15 days to go before the crunch EU summit on 18 October, the original deadline for the Brexit deal.The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, is due to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar. The EU’s new version of the backstop, which will be “substantially different” to the proposal in March to keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union, will be the focus. This is widely expected to include regulatory and customs checks away from the border.Michelle O’Neill, the leader of Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, will meet Barnier along with leaders of the region’s other parties: the Alliance party, the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Greens.Friday 5 October or Monday 7 OctoberThe Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, will go to Brussels on Friday or Monday, depending on the progress of continuing talks between British and EU officials.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May’s de facto deputy has promised publication of the UK’s Irish border proposal “very soon”, possibly as early as Thursday. This has the potential to be the first flashpoint in the fortnight ahead, but sources say it may not be published until the final deal is done.If not there will be plenty of potential for leaks and bad tempers.The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has told Theresa May she wants sight of the text before any deal is struck, after the DUP House of Commons leader, Nigel Dodds, told the prime minister his party would vote against any deal that involved any new regulatory or customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.The EU is also expected to deliver its new version of the backstop.A critical day in the final countdown.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, has pencilled in next Wednesday for the great unveiling of the EU’s political declaration on the future relationship with the UK. But it is “to be confirmed”.If there has not been any progress on the Irish border issue, its publication is likely to be delayed. This will be the first sign of how well, or badly, talks are going.As it stands, sources suggest that the paper is just “four to five pages” long and, apart from some extra aspirational language about deepening the trade relationship in time, the basic structure will be very similar to the Canada-style trade deal offered by the European council president, Donald Tusk, last March.The British government is expected to double down on its position that there should be a temporary customs arrangement (TCA) under which the whole of the UK would in effect stay in the customs union, while having the ability to strike free trade deals with countries around the world.The UK will also suggest that Northern Ireland could stay under EU single market regulations if the Stormont and Northern Ireland executive agree it.Tusk is expected to invite EU leaders, excluding May, to discuss Brexit at a working dinner on 17 October in Brussels. It is not the only issue on their plates: the leaders, including May, are set to discuss migration, foreign policy and security at the formal summit the following day.The EU summit has been cut to one day because of a long-planned meeting on 19 October between EU and Asian leaders. Bringing together heads of state and government from 51 countries, the meeting could add a piquant note to Brexit talks, as the British government prepares to strike out alone in pursuit of a “global Britain”.This has been billed as the “moment of truth” in the Brexit talks. The prime minister has already expressed her doubts that agreement on the Irish border issue can be found by the time of this summit.The UK wants the political declaration to offer a more expansive vision of the future trade deal in order to give assurances that the backstop, however it is finally formulated, is never necessary.Juncker has said he expects the meeting, which is supposed to last two days, but may be expanded to three, to be “interesting”. That appears to be diplomatic language for there being an almighty row.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has insisted that a subsequent summit in mid-November should be seen as a prize for resolution of the Irish issue. Can a solution be found within the corridors of the Europa building that satisfies both the EU and the UK? Sources on both sides admit to some bewilderment as to what this magic formula could be.This meeting was first mooted by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who liked the idea of a formal goodbye to the UK, in which solemn promises of a tight friendship after Brexit could be made.With progress on the Irish issue so troublesome, and deadlines slipping, the weekend summit is likely to be much more hard work than originally envisioned.Less music and speeches, more frantic scribbling in gloomy rooms. It is not by any means certain that an agreement will be possible here.Some see the talks dragging into December. It is the UK parliamentary timetable that is the problem. A certain number of weeks have been set down for votes on the withdrawal agreement. This is also a tricky milestone. If there is no deal by this date, the British government must make a statement within five days on what the UK plans to do, according to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act of 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93060d47c6b22656c5e087165cd3f31cbfc6f692/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=335263fc3162af73d9a0aa82116bf84c","title":"theresa may conference speech ambasts labour as she calls for tory unity","story":"PM makes several policy pledges in effort to show Brexit has not blown her off courseTheresa May has made a bold pledge to bring a decade of austerity to a close, as she appealed to the public over the heads of her squabbling party to back her to deliver a Brexit deal.Speaking in Birmingham on Wednesday at the end of the Conservatives’ annual conference, which was marred by repeated clashes over Europe, May cast aside the chancellor’s concerns about the health of the country’s finances and signalled Brexit would mark an end to public spending cuts.Despite widespread speculation about her future, May also made several domestic policy announcements in an attempt to show she has not been blown off course by Brexit or noisy critics led by Boris Johnson.But her most eye-catching pledge was the promise to bring to an end the decade-long programme of spending cuts imposed after the banking bailouts.“When we’ve secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the spending review next year we will set out our approach for the future,” she said. “A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.“There must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past. No undoing all the progress of the last eight years. No taking Britain back to square one. But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this: we get it.”Experts were sceptical about the idea of drawing a line under austerity in 2019. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “The public and most politicians are tired of austerity, but we’re a long way off from actually ending it.”Current government plans involve continuing to reduce the deficit until the second half of the 2020s, with significant cuts to many departments’ budgets pencilled in. May’s speech marks a significant change in rhetoric but actually ending the current era of public spending restraint will involve not words but significant tax rises and higher borrowing.The prime minister’s remarks were an effort to convince the public that “our future is full of promise” but they also appeared to signal Conservative anxieties that Jeremy Corbyn’s anti-austerity narrative has become “the new political mainstream”, as the Labour leader claimed in his own well-received conference speech last week.In a self-deprecating move aides later insisted was unplanned, May appeared on stage dancing to Abba’s Dancing Queen – and made a series of pointed calls for her party to unite.“It is no surprise that we have had a range of different views expressed this week. But my job as prime minister is to do what I believe to be in the national interest,” she said.The Treasury has been keen to stress that future public spending plans will depend on the exact nature of the Brexit deal Britain secures, with the chancellor and the business secretary suggesting a Canada-style approach would lead to slower economic growth.Hammond is also closely watching the financial markets, amid fears that the next few weeks could see sharp movements in sterling and share prices as the government battles to secure a deal.But No 10 sources said after the speech that May’s promise to end austerity in next year’s spending review, due next spring, was unconditional.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell said: “Theresa May’s claim that austerity is over is a con. If the prime minister wants to back up her words with action, Philip Hammond should announce immediately that the cuts scheduled for the next four years will be cancelled.“If he cannot, or will not, then Theresa May’s announcement today was not just empty – it was clearly a deceitful attempt to trick the public.”A day after Boris Johnson told a rapt audience in Birmingham that her Brexit plans represented a “betrayal”, May told her colleagues that if they failed to back her, Brexit could unravel altogether. “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” she said.She hit back at Johnson without mentioning the former foreign secretary by name, saying: “Leadership is doing what you believe to be right, and having the courage and determination to see it through, and that’s what I’ve been doing on Brexit.”Speaking about Brexit voters, she said: “We put our faith in their judgment. They have put their faith in us to deliver. I will not let them down.”May did not mention her Chequers plan, which rebel Tories have been urging her to “chuck”, speaking instead about “a free-trade deal that provides for frictionless trade in goods”, which would “protect our precious union”.Throughout the hour-long speech, May repeatedly returned to attacking the opposition. She sought to exploit isions in the Labour party, claiming she could see “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, in today’s Labour party but not on the frontbench.“Instead, their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn party,” she said, claiming the Labour frontbench “rejects the common values that once bridged our political ide”.Corbyn has been criticised repeatedly from the platform by cabinet ministers this week, underlining the fact that senior Conservatives regard Labour as a serious electoral threat.May said that in contrast to Labour, the Conservatives should appeal to voters as “a party that is decent, moderate, and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first. Delivers on the issues they care about. And is comfortable with modern Britain in all its ersity.”May also bemoaned the toxic nature of public debate, citing the murdered MP Jo Cox’s argument that political opponents have “more in common than ides us”.“Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies,” she said. “You don’t have to believe in a word Diane Abbott says to believe in her right to say it, free of abuse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dadd39724a9d29f6def78ec655659f8289fba75b/0_77_3009_1806/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e60f73b076641a293578018b4e943794","title":"too long devoid content theresa may conference speech total success","story":"One of the best speeches she has made as PM, this was still a Theresa May speechLook on the bright side. No one gave the prime minister a P45. Her voice just about held out. And the video screen backdrop with the word “opportunity” on it didn’t develop a glitch and switch to “porn” instead. After avoiding all that, anything else would be near enough an unqualified success.Not that there weren’t a few awkward moments in the buildup. As members of the cabinet trooped in to the hall, it became clear there weren’t enough seats for David Lidington, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond. Either they are not wanted on voyage or someone in the government can’t count. Four ordinary punters were unceremoniously hoiked out of the auditorium.Then the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, chose to use his 10-minute introduction as a pantomime audition. Blackadder channels Brian Blessed. The audience went wild and if the Tory party conference had ended at that point everyone would have gone home delirious. If there is a next year, Theresa May will be more careful in her choice of warm-up act. No one wants to be upstaged on their big day out.Still, at least the prime minister nailed her entrance. As Abba’s Dancing Queen was played through the PA system, Theresa hoofed her way on stage doing a reprise of her cringe-inducing South African Peter Crouch dance. Whatever else she has achieved in her time in office, no one can say she hasn’t worked hard at refining her Maybot image. This latest iteration looked the real deal. Britain: not just world leaders in AI, but a world leader as AI.Having won over the hall with a little self deprecation, May reverted to the more familiar territory of living down to expectations. There was no way of getting away from it: though this was one of the best speeches she had made as prime minister it was still a Theresa May speech. As such, it was riddled with contradictions, largely devoid of content and went on at least a quarter of an hour too long as the algorithms buffered in a spinning circle of death.“I want a party not for the few, not even for the many but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best,” she said. An almost perfect description of herself. No one can accuse May of not working hard or trying to do her best. It’s just that these qualities aren’t always quite enough in a prime minister who has turned mediocrity into an art form. What she wanted was a party where she could feel at home: whether her party actually wanted her as its leader was rather more in doubt. Many of the people who were politely applauding her had been cheering and whooping for Boris Johnson the day before.Oblivious to the pathos, May ploughed on with a plea for national unity. Seemingly unaware of the irreconcilable splits in her own party, she made the case for the Tories being the party of inclusion. “If your dad arrived on a plane from Pakistan, you can become home secretary,” she said. Yes. And once the government’s proposed immigration plans come into force, your dad will be on the first plane back to Pakistan. In a final, desperate, plea for someone, anyone, to love her, she begged a few Labour centrists to come and join her for a night in staring at the wall and sharing awkward silences.Then she moved on to Brexit. Here she had a genuine announcement. She had listened to the party and was going to “chuck Chequers”. As in “chuck the name Chequers”. She was still going to press ahead with the Brexit deal that the EU, Labour and dozens of MPs in her own party had already said was unworkable. She just wasn’t going to refer to it as Chequers any more. Instead it was going to be called “Nothing at All”. Mainly because nothing at all had so far been agreed on Northern Ireland or the future trading relationship with the EU. But once nothing at all had been agreed she was absolutely clear that austerity was going to end and we would all have lots of money even if nothing at all was agreed. No wonder everyone looked a bit confused.“Our best years lie ahead,” May declared. Thereby inadvertently drawing attention to the fact that everything had been – and still was – irredeemably awful for the past 10 years. But as a reward we would get to enjoy a Festival of Brexit Britain in 2022. To celebrate years of rationing and the fact that not all of us had died. Lucky, lucky us. Can’t wait.As the speech neared the hour mark, most people in the hall got a bit twitchy. You can have too much of an average thing. When May finally wound to a close, the audience clapped enthusiastically. Though not too enthusiastically. This was how the Tory conference ended. Not with a bang. Not even with a whimper. But with a stampede for the exits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38e9271ffc6129376cc0f91a3e798a925bfe87a6/64_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e36ad565398d1af8b98898a54726f9d5","title":"astronomers discover first suspected exomoon 8000 light years away","story":"Neptune-sized body would be the first known moon outside solar system and the largest moon yet discoveredAstronomers believe they have discovered the first known moon beyond our solar system, in orbit around a gigantic planet 8,000 light years away.The so-called exomoon, which is estimated to be the size of Neptune, would also be the biggest known moon, far exceeding anything known to exist in our own solar system. The team behind the apparent discovery said it needed further confirmation but that they had failed to find any other convincing explanation for their data.“The first exomoon is obviously an extraordinary claim and it requires extraordinary evidence,” said David Kipping, an astronomer at Columbia University in New York who has spent more than a decade hunting for far-flung moons.He said the moon’s estimated size was on a scale that had “hardly been anticipated” and “defies easy explanation” based on current theories of moon formation.Kipping and his colleague Alex Teachey made the discovery after analysing data from nearly 300 distant planets discovered using the Kepler space telescope. The planets are revealed by a momentary dimming of starlight as they pass in front of their host star, in what astronomers call a transit.Kipping and Teachey noticed strange anomalies in the transit data of a gas planet, Kepler 1625b, which is several times the size of Jupiter.“We saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention,” Kipping said.The findings were intriguing enough to win them 40 hours of observation time on the Hubble space telescope, which is four times more powerful, to investigate further.Using Hubble, they saw a second, much smaller dip in the star’s brightness 3.5 hours after the planet’s transit, hinting at “a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash”. On another transit, the planet appeared 1.25 hours earlier than predicted. This is consistent with the planet and moon orbiting a common centre of gravity, causing the planet to wobble from its predicted location.Based on the moon’s distance from its star, its surface temperature was estimated to be 80C, which is considered just on the upper end of conditions that could support life. However, astronomers said they had not dwelled on the question of habitability, since the moon is thought to be composed of gas. It would not resemble the fictional exomoon Pandora in the film Avatar, Teachey said.The findings are published in the journal Science Advances."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95284de8dc3f2c4524ccd78650b3f15486ce94e/0_0_4929_2957/master/4929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adc26baa9f2f03d41dff56e495122905","title":"increasing number of britons think empathy is on the wane","story":"Is it the schism of Brexit or the cranked up vitriol that flows through parts of social media? Either way, people in the UK are concerned that empathy is on the wane, with more than half of the population believing Britons’ ability to sense, understand and share the feelings of others has declined over the last year.It amounts to “an emerging crisis of empathy”, according to the Scout movement, which commissioned the research. Bear Grylls, the explorer, TV presenter and chief scout, has warned that if the trend continues “we risk more ision in our communities and increasing alienation among young people”.The findings follow research by Cambridge University that found empathy is a largely learned trait, although it can be passed on genetically in a minority of cases.But they come amid other indications of rising solidarity, at least among some groups. Support for increased taxes to spend more on health, education and social benefits is at its highest since 2002, according to the survey of social attitudes in Britain by the NatCen centre for social research.But there are splits in British society along generational lines about how much others need help and on issues such as climate change.Two-thirds of people aged 18 to 25 want the government to top up low-earning working parents’ wages, compared with less than half of people over 65. Equally, eight out of 10 of this younger group want low-earning single parents’ wages to be topped up compared with less than six out of 10 of the older group, according to the latest British Social Attitudes survey.Grylls said: “In a world that sometimes feels fractured and insular, empathy and kindness are more important than ever. When society is polarised we need to work twice as hard to understand each other and find ways of working together. I believe young people have a right to develop key skills such as empathy and kindness and we urgently need more adult volunteers to help us do this.”Ben Page, the chief executive of Ipsos Mori, said studies had shown that people born before 1945 and the establishment of the NHS and the welfare state were more empathetic towards the poor than each subsequent generation.Matt Hyde, chief executive of the Scout Association, said: “There is a worrying decline in empathy in the UK. We have a polarised politics and I don’t think social media helps. People are retreating into their own friendship circles and not engaging with people different to them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14be0e2f590e1bbcb5dbf5d749ceb0e04a5cb093/0_173_4112_2466/master/4112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0792dedf94ecdb3bff6a75c5319a476","title":"horse wrongly withdrawn race nottingham racing tips","story":"The most valuable afternoon in the history of Nottingham racecourse suffered a farcical mishap on Wednesday which left an owner threatening to quit the sport after his horse was wrongly withdrawn from a £25,000 race shortly before the start.Operative, from the Ed de Giles yard, was unruly in the stalls before the six-furlong sprint at 3.35 and withdrawn from the 16-strong field. But the racecourse PA system mistakenly announced it was the filly Magic Pulse, a 12-1 chance trained by David Griffiths, which had been withdrawn.The mistake was quickly corrected in a further announcement which seemed to suggest that Magic Pulse had been restored to the field. A third announcement then confirmed that, by order of the stewards, Magic Pulse had also been removed from the race, which was won by Belated Breath from the Hughie Morrison stable.Magic Pulse was a live contender for the contest on Wednesday as she arrived in winning form, having won on her last start at Chelmsford City in August. She was drawn in stall five and was No 9 on the racecard. Operative was drawn six stalls away in 11 and No 17 on the card.Craig Buckingham, the owner of Magic Pulse, was understandably upset after the incident and perplexed that it had not been possible to correct the initial identification error.“She wasn’t even in the stalls. The starter made a mistake. Fine, we accept that, everyone makes mistakes, but someone up here should have the balls to say it’s a mistake.Buckingham’s string includes Shamrokh, trained by Michael Appleby and the winner of two races and £15,116 in total prize money in 2018, in addition to horses trained by Griffiths, Marjorie Fife, Tony Coyle and Kevin Ryan.Tips by Greg WoodThe initial error arose after the starter wrongly reported to the clerk of the scales that the racecard number of the horse to be withdrawn was nine, rather than 17. This was then passed on to the racecourse announcer.An inquiry into the incident was delayed until after the last of the eight races on the card. The stewards later reported that “after due consideration” it had been decided that, while the announcement of Magic Pulse’s withdrawal had been made in error, it should stand.The panel heard evidence from the starter, the clerk of the scales, the announcer and the stipendiary steward. They also ordered that a report on the incident should be forwarded to the British Horseracing Authority for further consideration.Errors involved the incorrect identification of horses have occurred with some frequency in the UK over the past 18 months. Two horses trained by Ivan Furtado ran in the wrong races at Southwell in January, while there was a similar incident at Yarmouth in July 2017 involving two horses from Philip McBride’s yard."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d12fbf814a7a7c7a12ed522c132a127424d12df7/60_60_4374_2624/master/4374.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c588ca5b4d46e9ebc5fb3ec6d973e7e2","title":"sam simmonds injury blow england exeter rugby","story":"• Chiefs’ back-row to miss six to nine months with ACL injury• World Cup participation in doubt if he does not return by MaySam Simmonds faces an uphill battle to feature at the Rugby World Cup next year after being ruled out for between six and nine months with a major knee ligament injury.The Exeter back-row ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Worcester last weekend and will be unavailable for England’s autumn and Six Nations campaigns.Simmonds was not included in the most recent England training squad but he has been in excellent early season form for the Chiefs and offered a potentially attractive option off the bench for Eddie Jones, the national head coach. Now, barring a remarkably speedy recovery, the 23-year-old is coming to terms with the gloomy prospect that his season might be over already after just five rounds of Premiership action.It is a significant blow for Exeter, who have frequently benefited from Simmonds’s acceleration and low‑slung power close to the line.“If the operation and rehab goes really well we’d like to hope we can maybe see him before the end of the season but it’s going to be touch and go,” the Chiefs’ director of rugby, Rob Baxter, said. “It’s hard to absorb because Simmo has been a key momentum gainer for us. Obviously he is upset. He was looking forward to having a big season.”Back-rower hurt his knee in the win against Worcester after scoring five Premiership tries this season.\u0026nbspSimmonds’s uncapped Exeter teammate, called up for England’s tour to South Africa, has a hand ligament injury.\u0026nbspFront row with 59 caps dropped a bombshell a week ago by calling time on his England career to spend more time with his family.Marler’s former understudy, the 23-year-old Leicester prop is expected to be out of action until early 2019.Ruled out of the autumn internationals after foot surgery along with his Bath teammate Anthony Watson, who may also miss the Six Nations with a ruptured achilles.Powerhouse centre missed the South Africa tour after aggravating an existing injury in training with England. He has yet to play for Worcester this season.Arguably the form player so far this season, the fly-half was axed after his arrest in Jersey last month.The only possible upside, Baxter reckons, is that Simmonds should be back fit and raring to go in mid-summer if England’s pack require any 11th-hour reinforcements. “The other guys are going to be playing and are more likely to be picking up injuries than Sam,” Baxter said. “Two or three of them might go down yet. He may well find that, if he manages to get a big month in with us before the end of the season, he could look like the guy who is absolutely flying.”Baxter, who has lost another of his England squad forwards, Jonny Hill, for up to four months with a finger ligament injury, is also confident that Simmonds will ultimately come back stronger. “Yes he’s going to miss some big games now, but you’d hope those big games can get added on to the end of his career because he’s not taking the battering now.”Either way it is untimely news for an England coaching team still digesting the decision of Joe Marler to retire from international rugby to spend more time with his family. The Harlequins prop’s subsequent revelations about the mental stresses he endured in the lead‑up to England squad camps, meanwhile, have attracted some sympathy from his fellow players and coaches, with Leicester’s interim head coach, Geordan Murphy, and captain, Tom Youngs, both hoping Marler will be happier from his self‑imposed exile.“If he is getting anxiety then I feel sorry for him,” Youngs said. “If this means he leads a healthier life then fair play to him. That is the most important thing. There is a lot of pressure leaving your family and going away for a long time.”Murphy, though, stressed that no professional player should ever step on to the field with even the vaguest premeditated desire to pick up a ban. “You would be disappointed if one of our guys were deliberately trying to receive a card,” he said. “I think if guys are serious and in contention for selection they wouldn’t pull something like that.“In my entire playing career I can only remember one comparable episode.

This mixed bill is a picture of where he is now, no looking back. Having retired from classical ballet, 45-year-old Acosta is working with contemporary choreographers to carve a new route through dance.A new piece, Mermaid, by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui for Acosta and Marta Ortega sees Acosta in more of a supporting role (he was always a great partner). Ortega grasps an empty wine glass as her liquid body tangles itself tipsily around his frame. At least, I assumed Ortega’s character was drunk, being held up by her long-suffering lover, but according to the programme she’s supposedly a mermaid out of water. Whatever the interpretation, it’s an appealing pas de deux. Acosta’s strong, poised body doesn’t have Ortega’s fluid pliability but he always dances like it matters.Acosta has been a great encourager of other dancers, with an eye for talent, and he’s joined here by the young members of his own Havana-based company, Acosta Danza. They’re a versatile crew, straight-faced and nonchalantly athletic in Goyo Montero’s Alrededor No Hay Nada, a stark, striking collection of quick stop-start phrases. It’s set to Spanish text (a translation might have been useful), with the women looking Fosse-eque in black shorts, bowler hats and steps like exclamation marks.But they’re at their best when their personality comes through, in Christopher Bruce’s Rooster, set to the Rolling Stones, or the more spirited sections of Acosta’s Carmen. Rooster is an inspired choice for Acosta. Best known as one of Rambert’s signature pieces, it treads a tricky line between Bruce’s exacting choreography and the rock’n’roll abandon of the Stones, but Acosta brings added swagger and relish to the stage. He owns it. The company are mostly full of attack, lines snapping into place with verve, and they always look like they’re having a lot of fun.As they do in a noisy flamenco interlude in Carmen, a work originally choreographed by Acosta for the Royal Ballet in 2015 and now reworked, for the better. They stamp and dance on tables with authentic Hiic sexiness. You don’t get this kind of hip rolling at the Royal Ballet. The work’s fusion of forms – contemporary earthiness, Latin flair, Carmen on pointe – also works better outside the formality of the Opera House. Acosta wants to entertain (not always a given in dance) and when he arrives on stage as toreador Escamillo, he gets some ballet power moves to cement his status. His choreography has some nice turns of phrase and set pieces, although it’s difficult for any choreographer to keep romantic pas de deux endlessly inventive.The Albert Hall isn’t a great venue for dance – not least because if you sit in the stalls you can’t see anyone’s feet – but the scale and drama of Carmen better fills the vast space than the other pieces, hugely helped by the presence of a live orchestra.It’s an enjoyable evening that’s not so much the summing up of 30 years, but the next step forwards for a performer with plenty more to say and do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6859ba331042b6468cb4ba2600771e92eab5716b/546_922_1512_907/master/1512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67be225e38c2ec85f67fd8192aa96b7a","title":"west end black theatre misty arinze kene nine night natasha gordon","story":"Smash hits by black British playwrights were few and far between. Now Arinzé Kene and Natasha Gordon have work in the West End – and they’re changing the audiences too In 1957, Moon on a Rainbow Shawl by Trinidad-born dramatist Errol John won a playwriting contest organised by the Observer – but its promised West End run was rejected by producers who deemed it unsuitable for audiences. They didn’t think it would sell tickets, so a year later it opened at the Royal Court instead. We can only wonder what the landscape of black British theatre would look like today if the West End production had gone ahead.Now 60 years on, two smash hits by black British playwrights have transferred to the West End at once: Arinzé Kene’s Misty is currently at Trafalgar Studios, where Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night will open in December. First staged at the Bush and the National Theatre respectively, both hits are on course to widen the image of what a West End playwright looks like.Gordon has been hailed as the first black British female playwright to have a play in the West End. But she asks: “How can I celebrate that in 2018? If I want to take that as an inidual achievement, then sure, but what does that do towards moving us forward and opening the ground for the younger generation?”Sitting with her at a cafe in north London, Kene nods approvingly. Much is being made of how many – or how few – black British playwrights have hit the West End before them. It’s more than 10 years since Kwame Kwei-Armah’s Elmina’s Kitchen was staged at the Garrick. The Big Life, a 2004 ska musical, had a score by black musician Paul Joseph, with book and lyrics by white dramatist Paul Sirett. Ray Harrison Graham’s play Gary did a 1990 run at the Arts theatre. Mustapha Matura’s Play Mas transferred to the West End from the Royal Court in the 70s. There are still gaps in the history of black theatre so it’s hard to know exactly who came first – and how useful is our preoccupation with “firsts” anyway?“I feel like each time we have that conversation it negates what has gone before,” Gordon says, shaking her head. “The work that’s been done by so many black playwrights, black theatre groups, companies that existed in the 80s but closed due to a lack of support. We have these conversations about ‘the first’ as though there’s a sudden boom or it’s a fad, and I don’t think it helps us to sustain.”Kene and Gordon have never met before but greet each other warmly. He “loved” Nine Night she booked for Misty’s opening night as soon as she heard about the transfer. Gordon has Jamaican heritage and was born in London in 1975, while Kene was born in Nigeriain 1987 – his family settled in London when he was a child.A classic family drama, Nine Night revolves around the Caribbean tradition of hosting guests at a kind of extended wake for nine days after a death. Gordon describes the play as grappling with the tradition: “Why do we still have it, what does it mean, where does it come from? That was very much inspired by my experience when my grandma passed away.” Gordon will unexpectedly be taking on the lead role of Lorraine, the oldest daughter at the centre of Nine Night, in the West End. “It came down to practicality in the end, having a short rehearsal process and not everybody being able to come back.”Kene, known to many as an actor after roles in EastEnders and the Bob Dylan musical Girl from the North Country, has always written, too his plays include the award-winning Estate Walls and the one-man play Good Dog. Nine Night is Gordon’s debut play after years as an actor in, among other things, the BBC Doctor Who spin-off Class. The similarities between the two are perhaps found less in who they are or what they have written, and more in the support they have received from their communities.Gordon, who had never thought of writing a play before, wrote Nine Night following encouragement from a small group of black female actor friends in their 40s. Calling themselves the Brunch (after the time of day they would meet), they forged solidarity in an industry that breeds competition. Kene also shares early drafts of his work with his peers, in particular actors Daniel Kaluuya and Anthony Welsh.The discussion around black British playwrights is inextricably linked to audiences, black or not. Perceptions that black audiences don’t come, or that white audiences won’t care, are changing. Gordon says that at Nine Night’s first preview, “at 7.20pm in the auditorium it was mostly white people and I thought OK, this is as I expected. And then at 7.29pm, I looked around and went, ‘Oh my God. We’re here! This is happening!’” Gordon and Kene both laugh.Kwei-Armah, who is now the artistic director of the Young Vic, tells me: “When Elmina’s Kitchen opened on the West End, there was a feeling of a ceiling being smashed I was completely humbled. That now feels like a crack in the glass. We all have a responsibility to ensure more work by black British playwrights is seen and heard, and that we programme work that challenges the often limiting perceptions of blackness.”The Alfred Fagon Award for the best play by a black British writer continues to find real gems. However, it’s damning to note that, year on year, most of the shortlisted plays haven’t been produced. It’s clear the writing is happening, and the writing is good, but the platforms aren’t there.So how are Kene and Gordon feeling about their West End playwriting debuts? Kene smiles at Gordon, asks for a high five and gets one. “That’s how I feel about it.” They both laugh. “Oh, for sure I’m nervous.” Gordon adds. “But more excited now. Now that it’s coming closer and closer, the excitement is starting to seep into my big toes.”“There is momentum,” Kene adds. “In fact, there always has been. It started way before I was born. This is our part in this moment, after the work of Barry Reckord and Winsome Pinnock, Roy Williams and Kwame, and everybody else who I’m missing out. This is us all pushing together, and I definitely feel like this is what we should be doing. This is why it feels good. This is why I want to really celebrate it, and never stop celebrating it. I see it as a fire, and sometimes a fire is raging, and sometimes it’s kind of burning but it’s really small. I want it to rage for as long as possible.”• Misty is at Trafalgar Studios, London, until 17 November. Nine Night opens at Trafalgar Studios on 1 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be3b3312a0b24e365565500673a6f255e84e155/0_66_3326_1997/master/3326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65cfd45b95be6c0c47ceba82458e61b5","title":"amazon offsetting pay rise by removing bonuses union says","story":"Online retailer hit headlines for pay award but GMB accuses it of ‘stealth tax’ on workersAmazon has been criticised for slashing benefits for UK warehouse workers, offsetting at least half of a big pay rise announced this week.The removal of employee share and incentive schemes could cost thousands of workers £1,500 in a single year, according to the GMB union, which accused the online retailer of imposing “a stealth tax on its own wage increase”.The changes emerged after Amazon – which has been heavily criticised for its treatment of its lowest paid workers – won plaudits for announcing on Tuesday that it was increasing minimum pay in the US and UK. Minimum pay for permanent and temporary staff in the UK will rise by £1.50 an hour to £9.50 outside London and by £2.20 to £10.50 in the capital.The retailer’s warehouse workers currently receive one Amazon share, worth $1,961 (£1,508), at the end of every year they work at the company, and an additional share once every five years. If they hold on to the shares for two years, they can cash them in tax free, according to the GMB.The loss of that payout would be equivalent to roughly half the £3,120 rise in pay promised to the average Amazon warehouse worker outside London. These workers currently earn about £17,000.The GMB said that staff will also no longer be eligible for cash bonuses they can currently earn if they meet productivity and attendance targets over the peak Christmas trading period. Amazon denied that such a bonus scheme existed.Tim Roache, the GMB’s general secretary, said Amazon had not said “a dicky bird about cutting staff benefits” when the new hourly pay rates were announced.Roache added: “This is a basically a stealth tax by the employer on its own wage increase – a clear case of robbing Peter to pay Paul.“If Jeff Bezos – the richest man in the world – really wants to give hardworking staff a pay rise, he should let them keep their share options as well as increasing their hourly rate.”It said it would be phasing out share bonuses and would replace them with a sharesave scheme, which allows employees to buy shares at a discount over three or five years.The company added: “The significant increase in hourly cash wages more than compensates for the phase out of incentive pay and RSUs. We can confirm that all hourly Operations and Customer Service employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement. In addition, because it’s no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable.”In the UK, the company is keen to increase its appeal to potential employees as a slowdown in the number of EU workers arriving since the Brexit vote, together with record job vacancies, has made it harder for companies to find staff.On Wednesday, the Tesco boss, Dave Lewis, said Amazon was “catching up” to the supermarket’s pay rates for its warehouse workers. He said Tesco pays more than Amazon’s new hourly rate in nine of its distribution centres and an average £9.83 an hour across 12 close to the online retailer’s facilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9119b8fb8737aa66bcc1f89606177aee202e606/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1589b79b3b880fb87532571c8efc8e97","title":"microsoft surface pro 6 surface laptop 2 surface studio 2","story":"Company also launches Surface Studio 2 PC, with all machines coming with improved processors and new colour optionsMicrosoft has launched new, faster versions of its popular Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and large Surface Studio PCs.The new models, announced in New York on Tuesday, continue Microsoft’s premium PC line, introducing Intel’s latest 8th-generation Core i5 and i7 processors to match competitors such as Apple’s MacBook Pros, Huawei’s MateBook X Pro and Dell’s XPS 13.The much anticipated update to support the modern USB-C port failed to materialise, despite Microsoft shipping the Surface Book 2 and Surface Go with USB-C this year.

Otherwise it’ll be pushed out to users over the next month or so.You can delay the update for a certain period, but you won’t be able to stop it indefinitely. Microsoft only supports older versions of Windows for two years or less from release, so the only way to keep using a supported version of Windows is to keep updating, which is crucial for security.The Windows 10 October 2018 update revamps Microsoft’s efforts to better integrate Windows with Android and iOS, after the death of Windows Mobile. The new Your Phone app will provide access to photos and texts from an Android phone directly on your PC so you can send SMS and download photos.iPhone users will be able to send web pages they’re currently viewing on their smartphone to their PC.Microsoft’s Timeline feature, which allows you to pick up where you left off on the current PC or another that you’re signed into, is also coming to phones. Android users will need the Microsoft Launcher app, while an iPhone preview will arrive later.Microsoft bought the British AI-powered mobile keyboard app SwiftKey in 2016. Now it’s bringing the firm’s smart keyboard predictive text systems to Windows 10. Using AI and machine learning, the keyboard’s autocorrect and next-word prediction should be dramatically improved in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese or Russian.Ever wanted to copy text from one PC to another? No, me neither, but you can now with Cloud Clipboard, using the same technology that underpins the Timeline syncing feature. The clipboard has also been enhanced with history and the ability to pin frequently pasted items, which can be synced across machines too.Hitting Win key + V will bring up the new experience ready to paste text, code or images under 1MB from the history.It’s hard keeping up with the ever increasing amounts of emoji. The October 2018 update comes with support for Unicode 11 and 157 new emoji, including superheroes, redheads, a pirate flag and a llama.Some of Microsoft’s existing emoji have been tweaked too, including its range of ninja cat emoji. Nice. Hit Win key + the full stop key to bring up the emoji panel.Microsoft has improved the way search works on Windows. Now there are big previews of files, documents, emails, contacts and other bits, a list of recently accessed files when you search for Word or another app, and “Pick where you left off” section to get right back into it.If your Word docs and PowerPoint presentations weren’t already littered with enough pictures and animations, now you can embed 3D animations, AI-powered Smart Art and hand-drawn scribbles if you have a stylus.Lots of things have changed for Microsoft’s Edge browser, but the most useful is probably the ability to prevent sites automatically playing video. There’s also a new dictionary look-up function, improvements to PDF handling and support for the Web Authentication API (for using biometric and security key logins).The long-standing built-in screenshot app, Snipping Tool, is being phased out to be replaced by the Snip \u0026amp Sketch app downloaded from the Microsoft Store. Snipping Tool will still be available for a bit, but Microsoft says its days are numbered.Instead Microsoft is adding some new shortcuts, including Win Key + Shift + S to trigger a new screenshot toolbar, a new Action Centre button for screenshots and the ability to map the long-standing Print Screen key to Snip \u0026amp Sketch.Still, this feels like the death of MS Paint all over again.From causing your machine to grind to a halt or actually rebooting right when you need it, updates to Windows can be a nightmare.Microsoft says it’s new “intelligent reboot scheduling“ will use AI to work out when you’re really not using your machine, outside of set active hours and when not on battery power, and only install updates then. Generally that’ll mean when you plug it in at night, and it will even mute sounds if it reboots so not to wake your household up.Windows 10 users will now have more granular control over what data Microsoft can use for things like problem solving and product updates.

In August, Apple became the first public company with a trillion dollar valuation.Apple and Google have held the top two spots for six consecutive years, according to Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report, while Facebook slipped one place in 2018 to ninth after being the fastest growing brand for five years.Meanwhile brands that made the top 100 in 2017 but were ejected this year included Tesla, Thomson Reuters, Moët \u0026amp Chandon, and Smirnoff.Charles Trevail, chief executive of Interbrand, said those brands that were able to respond to the changing needs and expectations of customers were the most successful. “Today we live in a world where consumers have more power than ever, curating their own personal brands in ways we’ve never seen.

From here cable cars climb almost 500 vertical metres over the Grand Motte glacier to the top station at 3,456 metres. It’s as “up there” as you get in terms of accessing the mountains with your trainers on – the second-highest cable car in France after the Aiguille de Midi in Chamonix.To reach base station, passengers take a funicular which tunnels 1,000 metres up through the mountain from the village of Val Claret to the Grande Motte glacial plateau. Once on the cable car, I was one of the first people to climb the small metal staircase onto the roof. I was so busy taking my camera out of my backpack that I didn’t notice we’d started moving. The new car is astonishingly quiet, and smooth. The chest-high glass barrier surrounding the deck acted as a windbreaker, and with the sun shining there was no need for a jacket.From our rooftop spot, we had 360-degree views of a sea of peaks: Grande Casse, with its imposing summit ridge and broad, steep runnelled face and, in the distance, Mont Blanc. Below us was an expanse of blue-grey ice and huge yawning crevasses. Anyone who has ridden a cable car before knows how opaque those ski-scratched Perspex windows can be. By contrast the views from this new cable car terrace are as clear as from a chairlift – although no chairlift I’m aware of flies you over swathes of glacial ice, dispatching the two-kilometre distance in a mere five minutes.It is this bird’s-eye view of the rugged landscape offered by the cable car terrace that Tignes is hoping will help attract more summer visitors to the area. Historically, the resort’s summer tourism has been dominated by its glacier skiing, but faced with glacial retreat and a shortening summerautumn ski season, it is keen to shift the emphasis to the surrounding ecology and fauna. This attraction, replacing the old 1975 cable car (which was notorious for breaking down), is stage one of a €17m investment which, over the next two years, will include the introduction of panoramic viewing platforms over the glacier and information boards detailing the unique ecosystem of the surrounding national park.“In the winter, I used to ask people, ‘do you know where you are skiing?’” says Eva Aliacar, Vanoise national park director. “And they would answer ‘Tignes’. And I would say ‘yes, but you are also in the Vanoise national park and Tignes-Champagny nature reserve, full of so much nature and beauty.”Eva points out an area behind us, which six pairs of majestic bearded vultures inhabit.

Plus 5 more autumn tripsI smell the harvest before we see it – a floral sweetness drifts in the autumn air, while a hint of wood smoke lingers on the nose. I’m on the Somerset Levels, that secret area of wetland bounded by the Mendips, the Quantocks and the Blackdown Hills, and heading to Pass Vale Farm at Burrow Hill, which is a place of pilgrimage for lovers of all things cider. And during September and October, the place is busy.The orchards that surround the farm bustle with machines that grab the trees and shake them until the apples drop. Tractors scoop the fallen fruit from the ground, and the yard is piled high with apples ready for the press. But Julian Temperley, doyen of British cider makers, finds time to stop and chat. The man is a pioneer who, after a gap of 300 years, reintroduced the distilling of cider brandy to England.But the Levels aren’t all about apples and cider. Basket weaving has been big here for millennia, and at Coates English Willow in Stoke St Gregory, I watch the process from raw material to finished product.I start with a tour of the workshops (adult £4.50, child £3). From log and shopping baskets to picnic hampers and tea trays, everything is handmade using centuries-old techniques. The warm smell of damp willow fills the air and is accompanied by the rhythmic sound of snipping and creaking.Footpaths lead from the workshops past newly processed willow rods (used to make baskets rigid) drying in the autumn sun, and down to fields where the willow is being grown. Planted in plots drained by the River Tone, they twitch and clack in the breeze, and are a haven for wildlife.The RSPB helps maintain the area as an internationally important habitat for wildlife of all kinds. The charity is also a partner in the Great Crane Project, which saw the reintroduction of cranes at a secret location on the Levels after an absence of 400 years. Brought over as eggs from Germany, the first birds were released in 2010, and now the population has risen to almost 100. The cranes are not easy to find – I took a walk along a stretch of the Parrett Trail, a 50-mile footpath that follows the River Parrett from its source in the hills around Chedington, Dorset, to Burnham-on-Sea – and although I’d been told by Ellie, our guide at Coates English Willow, that these magnificent metre-high birds were often seen in the meadows and fields I strolled through, I was unlucky.Before returning the bike, I called in at Muchelney pottery, where John Leach (grandson of Bernard Leach, the “father of British studio pottery”) makes his wood-fired pots (johnleachpottery). I bought a beautiful bowl that seemed to reflect the light of the surrounding landscape in its soft, orangey glaze, and then it was back to Langport through the glow of the afternoon autumn sun, and on to our hotel.I stayed at the Devonshire Arms (doubles from £90 B\u0026ampB) in Long Sutton. With views of the village green and a cracking dinner menu (I went for the pan roast hake cake, £16.95) it also serves Temperley’s cider brandy, which has to be the only way to toast the beauty of this hidden corner of England.Peter Benson’s novel The Levels is published by Alma Books (£7.19)For the literature lover, CalderdaleWith its rich literary heritage, Calderdale, in the south Pennines of West Yorkshire, is a bookworm’s dream.

The buzzword? “Kind”.I know what you’re thinking – we’ve been told to be kind to each other for years. Everyone from Aristotle to Princess Diana has extolled its virtues as Mark Twain said: “Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”But the current iteration is different to the previous “pay it forward” variety. The new kindness is about putting yourself first – being “kindful”, in the same way you would be “mindful” in your day-to-day life. Why? Because if you’re not kind to yourself, how will you ever be kind to others?As with any new idea from the wellbeing world, some people have trouble getting on board. And I’ve noticed that kindfulness is a concept men especially can struggle with. After all, for decades guys were told to “man up” and encouraged to repress their feelings. Anything else was unmanly. It left generations unable to articulate their troubles at all.But with our mental health now a headline issue, 2018 feels like the tipping point – the moment when men say: “Enough is enough.”Matt Coyne, author of bestselling parenting guide Dummy: The Comedy and Chaos of Real-life Parenting, agrees. “Growing up, I was left in no doubt that a ‘real man’ should be tough, uncompromising and too busy eating red meat and reverse-parking efficiently to have feelings.“I’m not what anyone would describe as a ‘man’s man’. I like musicals, I struggle to grow a beard and I once cried watching Pitch Perfect 2. Being a stay-at-home dad isn’t for everyone, but I can definitely say that I feel fulfilled by it.”Coyne is an advocate of kindfulness in his own unique way. “I’m not someone who goes in for that whole standing in front of a mirror and shouting: ‘I’m a tiger!’” he says. “I’d feel like a bit of an idiot. But I constantly ask myself: ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’“Ditching parenting guilt has been a huge part of becoming a happier dad. It took me a while to work out that I will always be a bad parent – according to somebody. The greatest kindness parents can do themselves is realise that the only opinion that matters is your kid’s. As long as I’m the greatest dad to one person – my son – that’s good enough.”But while Coyne has happily shrugged off the stereotypes of what it means “to be a man”, many others are still struggling under the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with attempting to be a doting dad, ambitious career man, loyal partner or perfect provider.The ManKind Project was formed in 1998 so men could get together and talk about the fact that society’s expectations of men are “based on power, control and invincibility”. It sets out a clear mission statement: to allow a man to live with confidence, and purpose, and create a life without fear for himself and those around him. In short – to learn to be kind to themselves each day.Experts agree that a seemingly small thing, such as altering a negative internal monologue, can have a significant impact. Steve Clarke is a leading psychotherapist at Priory’s Life Works residential rehabilitation centre in Woking, Surrey. He says that negative self-talk can be so ingrained that it makes men feel – perversely – as though they’re on the right track. He explains: “Many men believe they can identify a self-critical voice as that of a once-critical parent, partner or coach who used criticism as a way to motivate or punish.“An increase in male body dysmorphia, poor physical health due to neglect among some, poor work-life balance and financial woes can all lead to a negative self-image,” Clarke adds.“It’s important to take a step back and recognise your value. Ask some people you respect to describe your best qualities. It’s good to be reminded of our strengths, and it helps to improve self-esteem.”According to Clarke, other acts of kindfulness that can go a long way to achieving that much-craved sense of contentment include taking 10 minutes out of the day to spend by yourself. “Use this time to remind yourself that you have the simple things in life – food in your belly, a roof over your head, money in your pocket, running water, love, compassion and good health. You’ll feel rich beyond all measure,” he says.So what other kindful acts can you bring into your life? How about a rethink of your relationship with your mobile phone? Even workaholic Simon Cowell has gone phone-free. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” the music mogul revealed this year. “I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused. It has been so good for my mental health. It really is good for you and it has absolutely made me happier.”Psychotherapist Padraig O’Morain, who has also written a book on kindfulness, believes that this form of self-care can transform anyone’s life for the better. “People who practise self-compassion are good at taking on challenges … it is often our own condemnation that we most fear,” he says.But how easy is it to apply kindfulness to your own life? Writer Chris Brock was experiencing crippling anxiety when he had a self-care epiphany.“I suffered with anxiety to the point where my head was constantly buzzing with negative thoughts: that I was a failure, I wasn’t good enough and maybe I’d be better off dead,” says Brock, who has just written a book about his experiences, Do the Thing, Have the Power: Overcome Self-Doubt and Build a Life You Love.“Someone said to me: ‘Thoughts aren’t fact’, but I struggled with this for about six months,” says Brock. “One day, those anxious voices were beating me up and I said out loud: ‘Shut up!’ It was at that moment that I realised that our thoughts are not us. And that led me on a road to meditation, mindfulness, and taking ownership of my life.”Brock put a programme of self-care into practice: drinking more water, starting a gratitude journal to focus on the positive in his life, and avoiding reading too much negative news.“This is a lifestyle change and something you need to practise every day,” he says. “I soon noticed the change in myself and became aware of how good I could feel.”“Negativity is just really hard work and energy-sapping so I really like the idea of kindfulness as a kind of counterbalance,” Coyne adds. “I really think there’s something to it for men.”Caroline Millington is author of Kindfulness (£10, Head of Zeus) out on 4 October 2018Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s treating yourself well or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

Journalist and podcaster  Jimi Famurewa reviews his journey through fashion faux pas to stylish gentWhen I think of the questionable fashion choices that litter my past – the time I sported two bumbags as a 10-year-old, the roomy skater jeans I liked to wear halfway down my backside, that summer when I really, really got into leather wrist cuffs and backpacker-ish beads – there is one ill-advised look that always sticks out. In fact, among some of my oldest friends, it has almost taken on a mythic quality: a folkloric garment shrouded in legend and whispered rumour.It would have been around the late 90s and, as a 16-year-old, I had successfully badgered my mum into getting me a pair of wincingly tight, metallic silver jeans from the Littlewoods catalogue. I looked, in my eyes, incredible. Bold. Vaguely futuristic. And it was only when I saw my kind friend Chris’s gaping, faintly horrified expression – having risked a split crotch by sprinting to catch the bus for a night out – that I thought something might be up. “Jesus,” he said, unable to mask his disbelief, “you look like the Tin Man.”Despite the evidence to the contrary in this story, I’ve always thought of myself as, mostly, quite an assured dresser. I was lucky enough to have two innately stylish older brothers who provided useful visual guidance, stacks of style-minded men’s magazines, plus whatever clothes I could sneakily liberate from their bedrooms.This fortune gave me the confidence, as a tween, to chafe ever-so-slightly against the “Ben Sherman and Reebok Classics” hegemony of the time. Having siblings who were willing to take risks with their look basically meant that (the odd clanger notwithstanding), I always understood that there was nothing wrong with experimenting a little bit.But there’s something about climbing to the figurative base camp of your mid-30s, as I have now, that makes you reappraise everything that has come before. Obviously these days, men’s fashion has never been a bigger or more varied industry – in June, Euromonitor was the latest market researcher to find that it is growing at a faster rate than women’s fashion. But, squinting warily at old pictures on Facebook, I can’t help but wonder if my unabashed interest in cultivating a personal style occasionally manifested as, well, misguided overconfidence.Trends and personal phases are partially to blame, of course. Midway through my teenage years I became a skateboarder and soon found myself weighed down by enormous hoodies, baseball caps and chunky scuffed-up trainers. This gave way to the UK garage years – tight Reiss T-shirts, tighter jeans and Patrick Cox loafers worn without socks – which slowly evolved into a more casual university look with looser, paint-spattered Diesel jeans, clunky statement belts and, at one point, a thoughtlessly grabbed vintage T-shirt that looked like it said “IRA” on the back.Grooming-wise, this was also the time that – save one turn-of-the-millennium night when I briefly twisted my hair into little Craig David-style buds – I started to tweak the neatly trimmed look I’d had since my double-bumbag days. As I emerged from university (and increasingly frequented sticky-floored indie club nights), I grew my hair out into a kind of knotted demi-fro that was heavily indebted to (read: shamelessly stolen from) Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke.It’s here that I think my life as something of a charity-shop peacock truly began. I lived in winklepickers, tweedy blazers, pocket squares, deliberately moth-eaten, plunge-neck T-shirts and jeans so skinny they often ripped if I overdid it on the dance floor. There was a cherished, patterned cravat that I’m pretty sure I found on the floor outside a house party.In isolation (and the context of the guitar-mad mid-noughties), there was nothing wrong with any of this. But it was just all too much. The volume was up way too high. In thrall to a certain scene or look, I had surrendered all subtlety and true iniduality in favour of a kind of box-ticking maximalism.So how did I shed those fussy adornments and arrive at the quieter, workwear-focused uniform I tend to employ today? Well, fatherhood – which brings with it clothes that are often accidentally accessorised with a smear of mashed-up food – has definitely made my taste more utilitarian and less prissy. Taking inspiration from well turned-out colleagues in their 40s – all turned-up selvedge denim (finished with tightly woven bands) and Red Wing boots – certainly helped. And, in swapping Albam chore jackets for All Saints blazers, I’m certainly broadly in line with the times.But I think, more than all that, it’s the hard-won self-knowledge that can only come with age. Rather than swinging wildly from one trend to the next, I’ve found a groove that suits and reflects me. I no longer feel vaguely deficient if my look doesn’t neatly conform with what’s on a particular shop mannequin or musician or off-duty footballer. My hair has morphed into a low-maintenance, ragged low-top and I let my beard grow out when the mood strikes me. I invest in quality key pieces – slouchy shirts, Breton-style tees, go-with-anything white trainers – rather than haphazardly splurging on youthful fast fashion wheezes.The clothes, as per the often misattributed Mark Twain quote, do not actually make the man. It’s the other way around.

Photograph:  Stefan RousseauAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects the British government to table new proposals on Brexit shortly which could break the logjam in the negotiations ahead of the European Council summit in two weeks.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.There have been private signals to the Irish Government in recent weeks, while DUP fears evident at the Conservative Party conference this week have encouraged Dublin to believe that Ms May is planning a significant move on the backstop.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar travels to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, at which the two men are expected to discuss the progress of the negotiations and the prospects for a breakthrough before the forthcoming summit, scheduled to take place in Brussels in a fortnight.On the basis of briefings from Mr Barnier, EU leaders will decide at the summit whether to convene a special summit in mid-November at which a deal could be clinched on a withdrawal agreement. This would avoid the prospect of a no-deal Brexit which would see the UK crash out of the union next March.If a withdrawal agreement – along with an agreed declaration about the future trading relationship – is concluded in the coming weeks, the UK will enter a two-year transition period next March during which its relationship with the EU will remain unchanged.However, the EU has consistently made clear that this can only happen if there is agreement on a legally binding Irish backstop.Irish sources expect that the forthcoming British proposal will abandon the previous British idea of a “time-limited” backstop, which would expire after a set period, in favour of an “event-limited” backstop, which would only expire on agreement between the EU and the UK on a future trading relationship that maintained the current open Border.If sufficiently clear and legally enforceable, this could solve the backstop problem from the Irish point of view, though other aspects of the British proposal, including Britain’s relationship with the EU’s customs union, could still be problematic for the EU.The Irish Government could also object to any suggestion from Ms May that future regulatory ergence between the North and the rest of the UK would have to be approved by the Stormont Assembly, as Dublin believes it would amount to giving the DUP a veto.However, Government sources remain cautious until they see the text of British proposals, though Dublin believes that Ms May’s successful conference will strengthen her hand to make compromises. On Wednesday, in her speech to the conference, she criticised hardline Brexiteers who rejected any compromise with the EU on the withdrawal deal.“The people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit – their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice. A Brexit that might make Britain stronger 50 years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today,” she said.Appealing for unity, and implicitly warning of derailing the Brexit process if her government falls on the issue, she said, “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” Mrs May said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA WireEvery so often, when the crowd cheered, a siren went off near the head of the crowd.Whoop-whoop! But not too loud.That was the fire fighters.“I read you in The  this morning,” said a woman. “What are those Dragons’ Den lads up to at all?”That was one of the teachers.There were lots of teachers.Young public servants and people old enough to be the anxious parents of young public servants joined the housing march. There were men in suits and men in Snickers work trousers. Women in office shoes and sensible skirts and women wearing white chef’s jackets under their regular jackets. Office workers, shop workers, construction workers. Retired people. Students. A huge amount of students.People. Just people who want people to have homes.More than 10,000 of them converged on Leinster House demanding Government action on the housing crisis. Politicians in the Dáil were well insulated from the noise outside, but they didn’t need to hear the people to know they are angry.During Leaders’ Questions, the only topic under discussion was housing.Some TDs chose to forsake the chamber for the streets by joining the rally. Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, the Greens and People Before Profit turned up with party flags flying. The Labour Party – a brave group – mustered under their flags too, but shipped considerable abuse from other protesters when they arrived. They stood their ground.Nobody in Fianna Fáil was stupid enough to venture into the crowd under a party banner, although a handful of TDs and Senators stood silently and safely to one side of the stage, on a ramp behind an iron railing leading to the escape doors of Buswells Hotel. They weren’t noticed and they didn’t try to rectify that.Fine Gael, sensibly, stayed away. But we saw a few staffers, anonymous on the margins, taking in the scene. As was likely the case with Fianna Fáil’s shrinking violets, the erse nature of the attendance won’t have gone unnoticed by them either.The turnout was discussed in the carpark as chants drifted across Kildare Street. “It wasn’t just the usual suspects,” remarked a Government backbencher, looking troubled.More than 10,000 protestors turning up for a midweek rally at lunchtime. There is talk of a follow-up event, but this time on a Saturday. The politicians know the turnout for this will be even bigger, because housing is coming up on the doorsteps in their constituencies.Housing is getting uncomfortably close to home.The word used most in the Dáil was “emergency”. Micheál Martin, the Fianna Fail leader, used it four times in his opening question. And then some more in his follow up.He said the handling of the crisis has been farcical.“Delivery has not matched the high-flown rhetoric of ministerial announcements,” he declared, asking the Taoiseach to accept that the situation is now an emergency.“It is an emergency,” said Leo Varadkar. Sure hasn’t he been saying it since the start of the year, if not earlier?“Of course it is an emergency. If it was not an emergency, we would not be spending €60 million a year to put people up in emergency accommodation, we would not have brought in rent caps in urban areas and we would not have brought about fast-track planning. They were all emergency measures brought in because this is an emergency. Calling it an emergency does not actually solve the problem.”He then got embroiled in the usual spat with Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald, where she roars at him and he attacks her.She urged him “to officially declare the housing crisis as an emergency . . . He should accept that we face an emergency and then he should act accordingly”.Varadkar countered that the act of declaring something doesn’t build any houses. He then attacked Sinn Féin’s credibility over the homeless crisis in Northern Ireland and questioned the record of councillors “voting down social and affordable housing proposals in city councils, including South Dublin”.Mary Lou wanted to take the fight outside. She challenged him to go out to the gates with her and meet the protestors. Then he’d find out who has the problem with credibility.As the crowd gathered outside, there were exchanges about ideology inside. Fine Gael was the “landlords’ lackeys” clinging to the belief that the market is the solution for everything.The Taoiseach said that unlike the parties of the left, his Government isn’t ideologically “wedded to particular political philosophies” and simply wants to build new homes as quickly as possible and by any mechanism available.But it’s difficult. “There is only so much concrete in the country.”Opposition leaders blew holes in his numbers for newly-built social homes. Varadkar said there are different ways of reaching the figures for numbers housed, but people have been housed.“I’ve been there to hand out the keys.” One statement not in dispute – we’ve all seen the pictures.However, clever use of existing housing stock doesn’t build more houses.Back outside, Damian Dempsey sang “Where is our James Connolly” and the crowd cheered when he pointed to them and shouted “he’s here!”The final speaker was homelessness campaigner Fr Peter McVerry. He took to the stand with Tiny, an elderly Jack Russell terrier. “We’re both here to fight for housing – me and my dog.” To a chorus of youthful cheers from the students and a few blasts on the siren from the fire fighters he said “the private rental sector is part of the problem, not part of the solution”.And to loud applause, he reminded the crowd that an election is coming and politicians need to know “we are going to vote homelessness out”.Will the protest make any difference?“I think it will. It’s a massive crowd,” said Fr McVerry. “I think it has to put pressure on Fine Gael in particular to look at housing policy again and to accept the fact that a huge number of people do not think their policies are working.”Tiny, rather like her owner, is a terrier not to be trifled with. She’s a rescue dog, around 10 years old and awful cranky.“Don’t even think of petting her. She’ll take the hand off you.”Sounds like she could have a big future in property."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650685.1538595214!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"you re a legend boy michelin starred japanese chef gets cork kudos","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTakashi Miyazaki at his  Ichigo Ichie restaurant in Cork city. Photograph: Daragh McSweeneyProvision“You’re a legend, boy !” That’s how Michelin award-winning chef Takashi Miyazaki was greeted by one of the stallholders in Cork’s English Market when he rang in to order his supply of fresh produce to serve up at his Japanese restaurant, Ichigo Ichie.Takashi’s Michelin star award, announced on Monday, is all the more remarkable as it comes just five months after he opened Ichigo Ichie at the former Fenn’s Quay restaurant on Sheares Street in Cork where he and his team of chefs have come up with a form of Japanese cuisine that is proving a hit with locals and visitors alike.Behind the success is a fascinating story which Miyazaki relates in fluent English that rises and falls with the cadences of his adopted city, where he and his Irish-born wife, primary teacher Stephanie, are happily rearing their two young sons, Seán (three years and 11 months ) and Stephen (18 months).A native of Fukuoka on the island of Kyushu, Miyazaki was interested in painting when he was growing up, but his parents were opposed to him going to art school and he instead went to university on a sports scholarship, thanks to his prowess at kendo, traditional Japanese fencing.He got a part-time job in a restaurant at the airport in Fukuoka while at university and it whetted his appetite for cooking. He managed to get a job cooking fusion teppanyaki at a local five-star hotel where guests included rock stars such as Sting and Rod Stewart.Eager to learn about the various regional cuisines within Japan, Miyazaki moved to Hiroshima where, with a love of Irish music and in particular U2, he found himself working in Molly Malone’s Irish Bar serving up bangers and mash and cottage pie.“I had never eaten that kind of food, but it was while I was head chef at Molly Malone’s that I met Stephanie – she was teaching English in Hiroshima. Stephanie is from Offaly and we came over here on holidays a few times before I started to think I wanted to move to Ireland. ”Moving here in 2008, Miyazaki began working in a hotel before they started travelling around looking for a place to start his own restaurant. After trips to Belfast, Clare and Galway, they came to Cork and the fit seemed right. So began his mission to introduce Japanese food to Cork and Ireland.“I really wanted to make what Japanese people eat every day, but when I came to Ireland first, the sushi here was shocking, and there is so much more to Japanese food than sushi. But they thought they were eating true Japanese food, so I said I have to change that – and this has become my mission.”Miyazaki began by taking over reputedly Cork’s oldest Chinese takeaway, the Yangtze River on Evergreen Street, and in March 2015 he opened a Japanese takeaway, and the venture quickly proved a huge success, with long queues becoming a familiar sight.Visitors started coming from as far away as Dublin and Galway for takeaway meals as Miyazaki’s reputation spread, prompting him to look at opening a top-end Japanese restaurant. In April Ichigo Ichie, where the 12-course kaiseiki or tasting menu costs €95, opened its doors.“Ichigo Ichie means one meeting, one chance or once in a lifetime – I really liked the phrase. We use local produce and mix them with Japanese foods – for example, we use St Tola Irish goat’s cheese with miso, and we hope that mixing of cultures helps create an experience that people appreciate.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650039.1538599238!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"section 39 workers to get 1 000 in april in pay restoration deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe WRC, Labour Court Workplace Relations Commission at Landsdowne House Photograph: Alan BetsonThousands of support staff in the health service seem set to receive significant pay rises after a review found the level of responsibility involved has increased. The trade union Siptu will tell members at a conference on Thursday that on foot of an independent job evaluation assessment, staff such as healthcare assistants, laboratory personnel and employees in central supply units are set for a pay boost. About 5,000 healthcare assistants comprise the largest group to benefit from the review which will see them transferred to a higher pay band.The union will announce that some healthcare assistants could see their pay increase from about €32,000 to €36,000.The job evaluation review for healthcare support staff was agreed by Government as part of the Lansdowne Road public service agreement. The union is expected to seek formal engagement with the Health Service Executive in implementation of the review.The review comes as nursing unions have urged members to reject Government pay proposals which would increase allowances for up to 20,000 members. The Public Service Pay Commission rejected across-the-board pay rises for nurses. The deal for support staff is just the latest agreed within the health service, which is already heavily over-spending this year. On Wednesday, it emerged several thousand staff in State -funded voluntary bodies providing health and social services are to receive increases of up to €1,000 next April as part of a pay restoration deal. Employees of what are known as Section 39 organisations will also receive 50 per cent of outstanding restoration due to them in October 2020 and the remainder in 2021.The deal reached between unions and health service management on Tuesday night will cost €7.7 million next year. It involves employees in 50 Section 39 bodies. The total cost of pay restoration for all staff in Section 39 organisations will be in the region of €68 million. Unions had argued that while Section 39 staff had experienced pay cuts similar to public service personnel – who in some cases do similar jobs – they had not received any pay restoration.Section 39 bodies are HSE funded but the government had previously contended that the workers in Section 39 organisations were not public service employees.Talks were re-convened in September to avoid a threatened strike in the sector. Minister for Health Simon Harris said the new deal was structured in such a way that those who were the lowest paid would see their pay restored in the shortest period of time. Almost 90 per cent of staff who saw their pay cut will see on average three quarters of that reduction restored in 2019, he claimed.Minister of State at the Department of Health Finian McGrath said: “This was particularly important to me given that a majority of staff are employed in organisations which provide essential care and support for people with disabilities across the country. They deserve a fair deal and I believe that is what we have got.” He said a validation and audit process would need to be carried out by the HSE to ensure the funding sought by organisations was warranted and that pay reductions were applied.Siptu health ision organiser Paul Bell said the proposals “had the potential to provide members not only with money in their pocket but a clear plan for Section 39 organisation workers to have their pay restored in a manner which corresponds to their counterparts directly employed by the HSE”.The union is to recommend acceptance of the proposals in a forthcoming ballot.The trade union Fórsa,which also represents staff in Section 39 organisations, said the proposals marked a successful conclusion to a very challenging process to achieve pay restoration.

It is due to reopen in December. Photograph: Georges GobetAFPGetty ImagesWhen King Leopold in 1908 eventually handed over Congo, then the largest private estate ever acquired by a single man, to the Belgian state, the furnaces at his palace burned for eight days, “turning most of the Congo state records to ash and smoke”, Adam Hochschild wrote in King Leopold’s Ghost.“I will give them my Congo,” the king is reported by the historian as saying, “but they have no right to know what I did there.”Leopold was indeed extraordinarily successful in erasing from Belgium’s history a chapter of brutal infamy that only in the last 20 years – partly as a result of Hochshild’s book – has begun to impinge on the national consciousness and displace the narrative that a few still cling to.Generations of Belgian schoolchildren were told of Leopold’s “civilising” mission – a humanitarian king who abolished slavery, built roads and schools and introduced Christianity and democracy to Congo.In what became known as the Scramble for Africa, European rulers carved up the continent. In 1870, roughly 80 per cent of Africa south of the Sahara was under kings, chiefs and traditional leaders within 35 years virtually the whole of sub-Saharan Africa was made up of European colonies or protectorates or white settler-ruled colonies such as South Africa.Leopold made Congo a personal fiefdom. Over 23 years, he reaped an enormous fortune by turning the Congolese into slave labourers to gather wild rubber. As many as ten million died, Hochshild estimates.Those who refused were killed. Soldiers punished men who didn’t gather the monthly quota of wild rubber by hacking off their children’s hands and feet.“When we went to school, a lot of our teachers were former missionaries so the education that we got was that Belgium brought civilisation to Congo – that we did nothing but good in Congo,” says Guido Gryseels, director of the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Leopold’s palace in Tervuren outside Brussels.“We were all given a very favourable view of colonialism. I can’t remember a single negative comment.”Gryseels has been charged with reshaping that national narrative with a massive renovation of the now-closed museum expected to cost nearly €75 million. It is due to reopen in December.In my previous incarnation, before returning to report in Brussels, I helped edit an  series of supplements on remembering the decade 1912-22. It was a fascinating task. The decade has been largely recast from previous anniversary celebrations of the Rising into a broader, inclusive national narrative that encompasses the experience of\u0026nbsp other\u0026nbsp movements, labour, women, those who fought for Britain, unionists ...Celebration has become commemoration, in which the weaving of a new understanding of our complex, interconnected history no longer privileges just one story.Belgium’s task in rewriting its colonial history and so also repurposing institutions such as the museum is if anything more difficult. The question is what are museums for?But as the generation still connected to colonial administration or missionaries in Congo dies off, official Belgium has been shifting its narrative. The 15-year renovation of the museum, the recent naming of a square after Patrice Lumumba, and even the pride in soccer player Romelu Lukaku, are each helping to give Congo a new place in the country’s history.Some of the museum’s old exhibits will remain, but now they will come with explanations about Leopold’s brutality. The museum space is also doubling its previous size, with a new building that includes exhibits on Congolese history, culture and contemporary art.What it will most definitely not include is the human zoo the king set up, a copy of an “African village”, complete with grass huts, taxidermied animals and 267 men, women and children imported from the Congo to be exhibited in the three hectares of tropical gardens, in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence. It was a huge success: about 1.3 million, a third of Belgium’s population at the time, came to gawk.“We walk a tightrope,” Gryseels says, “between those who fear this transformation won’t go far enough and others who fear it will go too far. We see ourselves as being a forum for debate. But we also take a line that we condemn colonialism as a system” ."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650653.1538593293!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"from sos to dancing queen theresa may says take a chance on chequers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May and her husband Philip greet supporters after her speech at the Conservative Party conference at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham on Wednesday. Photograph: Stefan RousseauPool via ReutersThe disaster of her conference speech last year, when she lost her voice, was given a P45 by a prankster and saw the lettering fall off the backdrop behind her, was in everyone’s mind when Theresa May took the stage in Birmingham on Wednesday.“You’ll have to excuse me if I cough during this speech I’ve been up all night supergluing the backdrop,” she said after she sashayed to the podium to the sound of Abba’s Dancing Queen.But May’s speech to the Conservative conference in 2016, her first as leader and also in Birmingham, has cast a longer shadow over her premiership than the comic horror of last year. In that speech, she announced that she would trigger article 50 by March 2017 and outlined the shape of the hard Brexit she would seek in negotiations with the EU.In its most memorable and notorious line, she set the tone of the first phase of her premiership. “If you believe you’re a citizen of the world, you’re a citizen of nowhere. You don’t understand what the very word ‘citizenship’ means,” she said.May’s tone in Birmingham on Wednesday could not have been more different, celebrating ersity in her cabinet and trumpeting the achievements of the children of immigrants and refugees. Her message on Brexit was different too, making an argument for compromise and telling purists in her party that the perfect Brexit deal is unattainable.She offered no new proposals to break the deadlock over the Border backstop but identified only one red line on that issue, ruling out a separate customs arrangement for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. In the next week or so, May’s government is expected to present a new proposal which would go a long way towards meeting the demands of Michel Barnier’s “de-dramatised” and less-intrusive backstop.The Conservative conference struggled with two challenges: the party’s isions over Brexit and its failure to come up with a domestic policy agenda to rival Jeremy Corbyn’s left-wing social democracy. Despite her softer tone, May had little to say on domestic policy and her shrill denunciation of Corbynism will not resonate far beyond the Conservative party faithful.On Brexit, the prime minister did not use the word Chequers once during her speech, presenting her Brexit plan instead as a pragmatic proposal to leave the EU and maintain frictionless trade. Her words were enough to earn her a long standing ovation in Birmingham but over the next few weeks she will face more difficult audiences, in Brussels and on her own backbenches."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650642.1538592482!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"triumph of american values has left us unsure of its own identity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA spectator wears clothing in the colours of the US flag during a practice session ahead of the 42nd Ryder Cup at Le Golf National Course south-west of Paris on September 26th. Photograph: Lionel BonaventureAFPGetty ImagesThe nondescript hall, the accented oaths, the rivulets of tears across cheeks of all colours: citizenship ceremonies differ little. You can see this routine enlargement of a nation in Washington, Albuqurque, Dearborn and San Diego. You can also see it, however, in Dublin, Malmo, Hamburg and Perth. The British and French would question whether citizenship as a matter of personal commitment, rather than blood, was ever unique to the US. But even if it was, much of the world has caught on.The spread of this and other Enlightenment ideas is stirring, but also awkward for a nation that distinguished itself by them. From the start, what united America’s otherwise erse people was the sense of being engaged in an experiment: in civic rather than ethnic nationhood, but also in meritocracy over aristocracy, and in religious tolerance over its opposite. Through these ideals Americans defined themselves against the Old World.This point of contrast remained a viable basis for national togetherness well into the 20th century. In increments, it has weakened, less through the US’s own failures than progress elsewhere. The first World War immolated some of the autocracies in opposition to which the US found its identity. From the cinders of the second World War rose the modern, rational European state. After empire came post-colonial migration. And after 1989 came, if not an absolute win for democratic capitalism as the terminal point of human affairs, then its territorial spread.Lots of theories circulate about the present fraying of the US republic – about the rancour that fouls Washington, but also sport, entertainment and other former havens from politics. Conservatives blame too much immigration in too short a time. Others cite the absence of an external threat to rank with the Soviet Union. The modish explanation majors on the emergence of social media. All of these are plausible, but also a bit fiddly. A problem so large might have a cause that is just as epic.What if the source of ision is not the failure of American ideals but their normalisation across a broader territory? How does a nation define itself when what made it distinct has become commonplace to the point of banality? What do Americans share with each other that many other people do not?Lots of countries have a large migrant population, much of which is naturalised. Lots of countries are market economies with weak or non-existent aristocracies. Lots of countries – most now, in fact – are to a greater or lesser extent democratic. In short, lots of countries have taken the American example. The trouble is the US’s reliance on the unusualness of these characteristics for its sense of self. The rest can fall back on other things: long histories, say, or preponderant ethnic majorities. America has just its values and institutions. This “credal” nationalism is less effective when the creed in question is so widespread.Birthright citizenship remains rare outside the US, or at least the western hemisphere. Other than that, it is hard to think of founding American ideals that have not rolled out elsewhere. “In no other country on earth,” said Barack Obama, as a mere senator, “is my story even possible.” Yes, it is.None of this is to tease the US for being – as Johnny Rotten sang of his UK – just another country. Nor is there shame in a nation holding itself together with the trusty adhesive of myth. Mine believes that universal healthcare, like decent tailoring, stops at the water’s edge. Others teach their young selective accounts of the past. America’s belief in the uniqueness of its values is on the benign end of these fictions. With the heinous exception of slavery and Jim Crow, it is also true that the US was more enlightened (or Enlightened) than lots of countries in lots of ways for a long time, even within the west. “White Australia” policies did not die until the 1970s. Germany did not open up its naturalisation laws until the millennium. But such pre-modern rigidities have declined, leaving Americans to wonder, if subconsciously, what makes them American.From time to time, a well-meaning British politician will propose that such a erse nation as the UK must celebrate its shared values. Someone will ask what these are. Momentarily stumped, the politician will venture rule of law and democracy. The interlocutor will suggest that these things are not unheard of in other places. At that point, there is mumbled agreement that we are no good at abstractions, and the subject is dropped for a few years. In a sense, the US is beset with the same conundrum. The difference, as we are seeing, is the awesomeness of the stakes. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London. Jessie had that week received good results in a college assessment, and was looking forward to the visit of a penfriend from Australia. She told her mother she would be home on Friday.On Friday night there was no sign of Jessie. ‘We thought she must have missed the last train,’ her mother Valerie says. ‘But in the morning there was still no phone call. So I went shopping and came back, and I just thought, there’s something not right. I said to John, “I’m going to go down to Eastbourne.”’At the house...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

The first film was a box office success, grossing $745m, but Prince Caspian made $419m and Dawn Treader fared similarly.   Douglas Gresham, the author\u0027s stepson, said in a statement: “It is wonderful to know that folks from all over are looking forward to seeing more of Narnia, and that the advances in production and distribution technology have made it possible for us to make Narnian adventures come to life all over the world.“Netflix seems to be the very best medium with which to achieve this aim, and I am looking forward to working with them towards this goal.”The Narnia books have sold more than 100 million copies and been translated in more than 47 languages worldwide.Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said: “C.S. Lewis\u0027 beloved Chronicles Of Narnia stories have resonated with generations of readers around the world.“Families have fallen in love with characters like Aslan and the entire world of Narnia, and we\u0027re thrilled to be their home for years to come.”Police officer shot dead and six more officers wounded in South CarolinaComment: Crude mockery shows Donald Trump has found his 2018

visiting the Tower of London risk having swear words croaked at them by the resident ravens, the Beefeater in charge of them has said.Christopher Skaife, who has been the Ravenmaster at the Tower for seven years, said the birds are misunderstood, but intelligent – and have learned how to use bad language.In a new book, The Ravenmaster: My Life With The Ravens At The Tower Of London, Mr Skaife tells how the famous black birds are fed mice, rats and day-old chicks, and play games such as Kerplunk with their  and friend in exchange for their favourite foods.His favourite bird, 12-year-old Merlina, has become adept at using her beak to mimic noises and talk to him, he said.He explained: Merlina likes playing with sticks while rolling on her back and doing forward-rolls. She is also adept at mimicking strange sounds to get what she wants.This is a particular talent of ravens and there is nothing more embarrassing than walking around the Tower with a group of schoolchildren and suddenly having a raven hopping up to you and saying: ‘B----- off! B----- off!’Not only does she swear at children, Merlina is known to steal their crisps. The Ravenmaster said: Merlina has a knack for spotting — from the other side of Tower Green — members of the public eating Pringles. Stealing the tube and popping off the lid to cram as many into her mouth as possible, she will even take them to the nearest water bowl and give them a wash if she doesn’t like the taste.Mr Skaife, who served 25 years as an infantryman before becoming a Beefeater, says he has learned how to speak back to her, and calls her to his side every morning.He said: I’ve learnt to become a mimic myself. I’m hardly Dr Dolittle, but Merlina and I have developed this ‘Kn-ck kn-ck’ call that we make to each other.She’ll call for me, ‘Kn-ck kn-ck.’ And I’ll call back, ‘Kn-ck kn-ck.’Tower of LondonPolice officer shot dead and six more officers wounded in South CarolinaComment: Crude mockery shows Donald Trump has found his 2018 HillaryCharities must stop being \u0026#39uncharitable\u0026#39 if they are to survive, warns watchdogRussia\u0026#39s GRU spies behind dozens of \u0026#39reckless\u0026#39 cyber attacks, Government confirmsSlowing population growth is key to saving the planet, says David AttenboroughThe Apprentice 2018, episode 1 review: after 14 years, is it time this show was fired?Coroner condemns \u0026#39distressing\u0026#39 pictures taken of Westminster Bridge terror victimsComment: Theresa May cements her position with a conference masterclass in making the political highly personal Prince Harry tells schoolchildren: stay away from FortniteFrance warns it would prefer Britain to crash out of Europe without a deal rather than accept a compromiseComment: The party of freedom lives on in Theresa May\u0026#39s grim, nannying governmentYoung doctors being attacked on social media by patients, top medic warnsUpstart Crow, episode 6 review: farcically funny, but with a bittersweet twistModern slavery victim rescued from shed he lived in for 40 yearsMelania Trump pays poignant visit to slave fortress in GhanaNetflix set to develop ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’ as TV and film seriesNational Theatre admits it avoids using Royal prefix for fear of appearing \u0026#39elitist\u0026#39\u0026#39Armed intruder\u0026#39 chased away by security guard at Fethullah Gulen\u0026#39s Pennsylvania compoundComment: You can dance all you like, Mrs May, but there was nothing in your words to cheer a traditional conservativeComment: Heterosexual couples don\u0026#39t need civil partnerships, but siblings like my mum and her sister doWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/03/11/apple-emoji-iphone-ios-12.jpg","title":"apple new emojis iphone ipad ios 12 update bagel","story":"Created with Sketch.Join us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeJoin us Subscribe  registerJoin us SubscribeLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 14 daysSee the optionsAll 77 of Apple\u0027s new emojis, including a bagel, a badger and a broomiOS 12.1 software update will see new sports, food and animal emojis introducedClick to followThe Independent TechApple is adding more than 70 new emojis for iPhone, iPad\u0026nbspand Apple Watch users,\u0026nbspincluding a bagel, a broom and a badger.\u0026nbspThe new emojis come\u0026nbspwith the release of the\u0026nbspiOS\u0026nbsp12.1 mobile software,\u0026nbsphowever some of the designs are already proving controversial.Emoji are used by people all over the world to communicate, Apple said in a press release.iOS 12.1 brings even more characters to the keyboard that better represent global users, including new emoji for moon cake, red gift envelope and nazar amulet.Created with Sketch.iPhone XS launch in September 2018 Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

By supporting beoutQ\u0027s widespread and notorious infringement of the intellectual property rights of beIN and its partners, Saudi Arabia is setting a dangerous new precedent, said David Roney, a lawyer at Sidley Austin LLP who is leading the arbitration on behalf of beIN.\u0026nbspBeIN will pursue all available legal remedies to protect its rights and secure full compensation.BeIN also claims that Saudi Arabia has initiated a series of abusive measures aimed at forcing the Qatari sports network out of the local broadcasting market and destroying the value of beIN\u0027s investments in the country.This includes allegedly banning the importation and distribution of beIN set-top boxes and blocking access to beIN\u0027s websites and call centre.The alleged measures stem from a diplomatic dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which has resulted in a trade boycott of the tiny gulf state.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

How will the EU likely respond? And could this signal the return of the eurozone crisis?Click to followThe IndependentThe anti-immigrant League is led by Matteo SalviniItalian bond yields have been spiking over the past week, hitting the highest levels in four years, as the populist government in Rome has threatened to bust European Union borrowing rules.The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has pointedly compared the Italian government’s budget plans to those of Greece.But what is the government in Rome actually proposing? How will the EU likely respond? And could this signal the return of the eurozone crisis?A coalition between two populist forces. The first is the Five Star Movement, an eclectic collection of anti-politicians, with odd views such as the idea that vaccines are dangerous.Italy is pushing Europe to the brink of another economic crisisThe second is the anti-immigrant League, led by Matteo Salvini.Both groups, in the past, expressed hostility to Italy’s membership of the euro. They were the two largest parties to emerge out of March’s elections.And, against expectations, they managed to form a coalition in May.What is in this new budget that is so contentious?Italy’s budget deficit this year is set to be a relatively modest 1.5 per cent of GDP. The International Monetary Fund had projected it to fall to 0.9 per cent in 2019 and to just about disappear in 2020.But the populist government in Rome last Thursday tore up this script. It announced it would increase borrowing to 2.4 per cent in 2019 and keep it there for the following two years.What are the European borrowing rules?The European Union Stability and Growth Pact rules stipulate that budget deficits must be below 3 per cent. So Italy’s plans would not violate that.But the rules also state that there must be no increase in the structural deficit – the element that does not vary with the economic cycle. The likelihood is that this aspect would be broken.Another problem as far as Brussels is concerned is Italy’s sovereign debt pile, which is equal to 130 per cent of its GDP. That’s the highest ratio of any European country apart from Greece.The borrowing rules say that government’s with debt of more than 60 per cent of GDP should have a “faster adjustment path”.What have markets done in response?Italian 10-year bond yields, or interest rates, jumped as high as 3.46 per cent this week after last week’s budget announcement, the highest since 2014.Those sovereign interest rates are important because they affect borrowing costs throughout the economy. Higher rates make it harder for companies to service debt.Interest rates are still way short of the 7.5 per cent levels hit in 2011 as it looked like Italy might be forced out of the single currency. But the movement has been dramatic.And the fear is that a budget stand-off between belligerent populists in Rome and stubborn policymakers and politicians in the EU could, effectively, plunge the situation back into that emergency.So is the eurozone crisis coming back?The situation is volatile. Markets were particularly spooked by comments by a lawmaker from the League, Claudio Borghi, on Tuesday. He said that Italy would be better off outside the euro. That seemed to suggest that the government in Rome was actively seeking a confrontation.But Borghi clarified those remarks shortly after, saying that leaving the single currency was “not in the government’s programme”.Moreover, on Wednesday, the economy minister, Giovanni Tria, softened the budget plan, announcing that the deficit would not remain at 2.4 per cent for three years, but would, in fact, decline to 2.2 per cent 2020 and 2 per cent in 2021.Is loosening the budget really a bad idea?Many economists think fiscal policy has been excessively tight in Italy for many years and that the Italian government is actually justified in seeking to give the domestic economy a fiscal boost now. It has been through two deep recessions in the past decade and GDP remains well below its level in 2008.Yet the composition of the boost matters. More infrastructure investment in Italy is merited and should help lift the country’s abysmal productivity growth.Yet Five Star wants spending on a form of “citizens’ income” for the poor and a lowering of the retirement age. And the League wants tax cuts. These are measures that seem unlikely to benefit Italy\u0027s long-term public finances, even if they deliver a short-term boost to growth.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days.

The company\u0027s two founders left in recent days amid rumours that it disagreed with Facebook over how the company should be run.And after the Facebook hack was revealed over the weekend, it emerged that Instagram users and accounts might also have been caught up in it if they had used their Facebook log-in to create their Instagram account.Some of the accounts caught up in Facebook\u0027s hacks appear to be trading on the dark web, with cyber criminals able to buy access to people\u0027s accounts for just a few dollars, according to listings seen by\u0026nbspThe Independent.It\u0027s not thought that those issues have anything to do with the current outage, which is almost certainly simply a technical fault. Instagram goes down for time-to-time and can send major ripples across the internet, since more than a billion people use it each month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a rule, they are so far away that they prove difficult to observe directly from Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the entire episode remains completely mysterious, as both space agencies scramble to find out how the apparently drilled hole could have been made in the outside of the space station.Nasa has refused to announce any of the findings of those investigations so far. But it released the statement after reports in Russia that the hole had been drilled on purpose, since it was not a manufacturing defect.Russian media recently reported that General Director Rogozin said the hole was not a manufacturing defect. Ruling out a manufacturing defect indicates that this is an isolated issue which does not categorically affect future production, it wrote.This conclusion does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent. NASA and Roscosmos are both investigating the incident to determine the cause. The International Space Station Program is tentatively planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information.Nasa\u0026nbspalso said that one of its astronauts as well as Russian Cosmonaut will be heading to the International Space Station in October. During that launch, Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspAdministrator Jim Bridenstine will speak\u0026nbspwith Mr Rogozin, in their first in-person meeting, during which the leak will presumably be discussed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They found that a mysterious planet of the kind previously suggested — a huge Super-Earth on a very wide orbit — fit with the way that their new find was moving through the solar system.The newly discovered object is called\u0026nbsp2015 TG387, is probably a small dwarf planet at just 300km across,\u0026nbspand is incredibly far away. It is currently lying\u0026nbspabout two and a half times further away from the Sun than Pluto is.There could be many more planets like Earth than we realisedIt often reaches much further away. Its orbit takes it\u0026nbspto about 2,300 AU — that is\u0026nbsp2,300 times as far away from the sun as we are, and vastly more than the already huge\u0026nbsp34 AU that the distant Pluto sits at.At that distance,\u0026nbsp2015 TG387\u0026nbspis one of the few known objects that is so far away that its orbit is not affected by even the giant planets in our solar system like Neptune and Jupiter.These so-called Inner Oort Cloud objects like 2015 TG387, 2012 VP113, and Sedna are isolated from most of the Solar System\u0027s known mass, which makes them immensely interesting, said Sheppard. They can be used as probes to understand what is happening at the edge of our Solar System.The object is one of the strangest things that astronomers have ever spotted within our own solar system. But there could be many more of them than we have ever realised, the researchers said.We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the Solar System\u0027s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult, said the University of Hawaii\u0027s David Tholen. Currently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the Sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.The new discovery is being announced by\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union\u0027s Minor Planet Center.

It is the first time Yorke has scored a full feature film.The album also features the London Contemporary Orchestra and Choir, Noah Yorke on drums on “Volk” and “Has Ended,” and Pasha Mansurov on solo flute on “Suspirium.” The\u0026nbspSuspiria\u0026nbspsoundtrack will be released on 26 October via XL Recordings.Though he’s best known for his sun-dappled romance of last year, Call Me By Your Name,\u0026nbspGuadagnino hasn’t held back when it comes to his first foray into horror.Quentin Tarantino reduced to tears by new horror film SuspiriaFirst teaser for ‘absolutely brutal’ Suspiria remake Dakota Johnson claims making new horror film sent her to therapyThe central premise stays quite close to the original.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

They are demanding £5 per drop \u0026amp £1 per mile as a minimum rate.Matt Rouse, a striking kitchen worker at Wetherspoon’s Bright Helm pub in Brighton said he had been inspired by his co-workers to “call out injustice in our workplaces”.He added: “We are determined to stand together and make our demands for £10 an hour for all, and union recognition heard.\u0026nbsp“This is only the beginning, we will keep fighting for everyone, for better wages and rights for hospitality workers across the country”A bad Brexit could cripple workers’ rights Uber responds to calls for greater protection of workers’ rightsCBI says UK in slow lane.

But its workers have not traditionally organised to demand better pay and conditions, making the current strike\u0026nbspsignificant, despite its small scale.Boni Adeliyi, a TGI Fridays waitress in Milton Keynes said: “We’re striking on 4 October to show the strength we have when workers come together. The movement is growing and change is coming. All young workers should join a union – it’s important to know your rights and how to fight for them when they’re being ignored. Together we are stronger.”\u0026nbspStriking McDonald’s worker Lauren McCourt said the industrial action could transform the sector for the better.“The days of poverty pay, insecure contracts and lack of respect for workers are numbered. A living wage of £10 an hour for all ages, security of hours, and our right to a union are the basic rights we are fighting for,” she said.\u0026nbspThe strikers plan to convene a rally in Leicester Square on the day of the industrial action. They say they will be joined by hospitality workers from across the UK as well as from four continents.A growing movement of low-paid workers, particularly in the fast-food industry, has come together over recent years, catalysed by the Fight for $15 campaign in the US.A McDonald’s spokesperson said the company was “disappointed” to hear about planned UK strikes and said the numbers of people involved represented an “extremely small proportion” of its 120,000 workforce.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May dances a few steps as she takes to the stage to give her keynote address on the fourth and final day of the Conservative Party Conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamBoris Johnson warned that Theresa May’s “cheat” Brexit plans would leave the UK in “manacles” and lead to the dominance of the far right and far left in British politics during his speech at a fringe event at the Conservative Party annual conference in BirminghamScottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamProtestors set off on an anti-Brexit march, organised by the \u0027Best For Britain\u0027 campaign group, in central Birmingham Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

before changing direction and barrelling off towards Europe on Sunday.Previous reports of the strengthening storm said that Britain could expect fierce gales and torrential rain as the storm moved eastwards towards Europe, although its exact path was yet to be confirmed.Now weathermen have confirmed that the storm is heading our way, with charts showing the storms path curving menacingly up towards Britain.A Met Office Spokesman told The Sun Online: “Quite often by the time anything comes anywhere near the UK, all we’re left with is a bit of energy in the system rather than anything that vaguely resembles a hurricane.“But at the moment it’s far too early to say exactly where it will track and what stage it will be at as it crosses the Atlantic.“As it starts moving in our direction, we’ll get a better idea of how near to us what’s left will come, whether there’s anything that will affect our weather at all.“And it’s not likely to come in our direction till next week, probably mid-to late I would think, but it’s still a fairly fluid situation at the moment.Brian Gaze, director and forecaster for the Weather Outlook, told The Sun Online: Its too early to be certain about the impact of Storm Leslie on the UKs weather, but at the moment it looks like tracking to our northwest.That means a northwest to southeast split in the weather would be likely.In the north west of the UK there is the potential for it to turn very wet and windy.Areas farther south and east could remain dry, and possibly become very warm for the time of the year as tropical air embedded in the system crosses the UK.Some computer models show temperatures pushing up towards the mid Cs in the south east.However, it is too early to discount the chance of the wet and windy weather extending farther southeastwards.The enormous hurricane winds will blow over a huge  mile area, with less intense winds reaching as far as  milesEffects wont be felt in the UK until next week after Leslie has moved up towards the America.The National Hurricane Center in Miami has warned that large swells and rip tides could be le-threatening as the brutal storm closes in on the southeastern coast of the United States along with Bermuda and the Bahamas in the next few days.Before Leslies effects are felt in the UK, the south east is in for another warm spell today and for the next few days.The Met Office said: Given a good spell of sunshine we could see a C or C in London today, and tomorrow it will be similar.We could be looking at a C or C even on Thursday and Friday.The south east will also see the highest temperatures over the weekend.A weather front from northern Scotland will head down across the country on Thursday bringing some potentially heavy rain but winds will be mostly slow moving.Another front from the northwest will then descend to the southeast on Friday which could mean stronger downpours in northern England and Wales, as well as southern Scotland.The weekend is generally going to be cloudier and cooler, with rains following the weather fronts.It should dry up in the south east of England on Sunday but it will be a cold and bright day."},{"url":null,"title":"idiots attempt to dive into a swimming pool from a roof ends in a spectacular faceplant","story":"Footage of the unidentied man leaves viewers wincing as he misses the water by inches, and his body slams the ground.It is not as yet known where or when the stomach-churning footage – shared on social media – was filmed, or what injuries he suffered.The video shows a half-naked man standing on the roof of a changing room, after climbing up a ladder.Pals appear unfazed as he lines himself up for the jump with one even talking casually on his mobile phone.But as the man walks down towards the gutter, with his head tipping forward, he raises his arms and plunges too soon.Arms flailing in the air, the wannabe er smashes through the guttering and lands on all fours while his head bounces on the hard concrete surrounding the swimming pool.The footage blurs as those watching and filming his painful stunt yell out and rush to help the man, who appears to be knocked out as a result.The six-second video has been widely shared on social media in recent days."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438997366.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"638\" width=\"960","title":"theresa may dances onto stage for tory party conference speech","story":"The PM poked fun at her Maybot image as she got her groove on to Abbas Dancing Queen before appealing to the party to get behind her.And in a blast at Boris Johnson, Mrs May warned that anyone obsessed with getting the perfect Brexit risk leaving us tied to the EU forever.She also took a pop at the top Brexiteer over his f**k business jibe - vowing to back business instead.In the hour-long address, the PM:She admitted that the public needed to see that their hard work has paid off after struggling with cuts to public services in a bid to balance the countrys books.But in a blow to MPs who want to see her gone, Mrs May insisted she has a plan for the next year and beyond.The address received a massive standing ovation from activists, as husband Philip walked on stage and kissed her while ELOs Mr Blue Sky played over the PR.In her speech in Birmingham, the PM gave a spirited defence of her Chequers plan which has ided MPs and activists.She said: “We will not betray the result of the referendum, and we will never break up our country.“I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.”The PM added that her plan would respect the referendum while minimising the economic dangers.She said: “It delivers on the referendum. It keeps fair with the British people. It is in the national interest.”Hitting out at hard Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson, the PM added: Those of us who do respect the result, whichever side of the question we stood on two years ago, need to come together now.If we dont -we all go off in dferent directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit - we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.In a second dig at Boris - who has overshadowed the conference by making his own alternative leadership pitch - Mrs May said Tories shouldnt be saying f**k business as he did earlier this year.She said: To all business - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.It has a single syllable. It is of Anglo Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter K. Back business!Mrs May vowed to bring an end to austerity after a decade-long financial squeeze, telling hard-pressed voters: “The end is in sight.”Praising the fall in the deficit, she added: “This is a historic achievement - but getting to this turning point wasn’t easy.“Public sector workers had their wages frozen, local services had to do more with less, and families felt the squeeze.“Fixing our finance was necessary - there must be noto the uncontrolled borrowing the past, no undoing all of the progress of the last eight years, no taking Britain back to square one.“But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this - we get it.”The PM revealed the Government will turn on the spending taps again next year once theyve finished the job of cutting a Brexit deal with Brussels.And she delivered a love letter to Britain, listing the countrys achievements and adding: Dont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes.Mrs May also launched a blistering attack on Jeremy Corbyn - warning that Tories have a “duty” to keep him out of power.The PM said the Labour boss was making Jewish Brits feel unsafe in their own country and claimed the party has lost its moral backbone.Mrs May said: “The Jeremy Corbyn party rejects the common values that once bridged our political ide.”She added: What has befallen Labour is a national tragedy.She went on: What has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should goJeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister That is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour party. It is our duty, in this Conservative party, to make sure he can never do it to our country.THERESA May tried to overcome last years disastrous conference speech by making a string of jokes about it.After she came on shimmying to Abbas Dancing Queen - mocking her cringey dance moves form a recent trip to Africa, she joked that some could even have been inspired to become professional dancers after seeing her moves. months ago Mrs May was forced to stop several times during her crunch speech while she tried to clear her throat.But she laughed it off today, telling the audience: Youll have to excuse meI cough during this speech.The PM has been suffering with a snfle for the last few days, sparking fears of another spluttering disaster.And she quipped on the backdrop which came down last year as she was talking, saying: Ive been up all night super-gluing the backdrop.Mrs May also made a stinging joke about her ex-Cabinet colleague Boris Johnson, who gave a barn-storming speech to activists yesterday.A few months ago he caused uproar by reportedly uttering the words f**k business.But lashing back, Mrs May said today: And to all business - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.It has a single syllable. It is of Anglo Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter K. Back business.After talking about her Housing Secretary James Brokenshire’s treatment and recovery from cancer, the PM revealed her own goddaughter died from the disease last year.She said: “Cancer can strike any of us at any time.“A few years ago my goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer.“She underwent treatment and it seemed to be working, then the cancer came back.“Last summer she sent me a text to tell me she was hoping to see another Christmas. But she didn’t make it.”Senior Tories hailed the PM’s speech - comparing it favourably to last year’s total meltdown.Jeremy Hunt said: “Congratulations Theresa May for a remarkable speech delivered with humour and passion.“Firmness of purpose, clarity and conviction - EU friends do not underestimate!”And Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell quipped on Twitter: “Waited  months for that #outthepark”.But Labour dismissed her speech as empty rhetoric - shadow minister Andrew Gwynne said: Try telling local government across England there’s an end to austerity... deep cuts to our public services are continuing and they have Theresa May’s fingerprints all over them!And Lib Dem boss Vince Cable joked: “As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her.The PM said during her conference speech: “Something’s changed for the worse. Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies.“People who put themselves forward are becoming targets, their families as well.“We all saw the sickening pictures of a far-left extremist shouting abuse at Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children.“And it’s not only Conservatives who are facing abuse the first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over  years ago.“You don’t have to agree with a word Diane Abbott says to believe passionately in her right to say it free from threats and abuse.”Ms Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, welcomed her nice words but lashed out at the Tories for deliberately targeting her with their adverts during last years election.She tweeted: Some nice words from Tory leaders like Theresa May and Sajid Javid.

She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose.

And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers.

It falls to our party to lead our country through it.”Top of Mrs May’s list of fresh ­policy offers was a major move to get thousands more frustrated families on the housing ladder.She announced the Government is to scrap a long-standing cap on how much councils can borrow against their current housing stock to build more homes.There are .million households on the waiting list, but only , homes were made available in .Explaining the change in thinking, Mrs May said: “We cannot make the case for capitalismordinary working people have no chance of owning capital.Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation.“It doesn’t make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it.”The state will also spend more from next year while still keeping the nation’s finances under control, the PM pledged.In answer to pleas for more cash to ease the pressure on Britain’s crowded schools, stretched hospitals and creaking defences, she promised that “support for public services will go up”.Mrs May added: “Because you made sacrices, there are better days ahead.“A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.”Issuing her final plea for unity, the PM ended her address with the declaration: “When we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve.”Her speech brought a long standing ovation from the audience in Birmingham — appearing to have won over sceptical Tory activists for now.Only minutes before Mrs May began her address yesterday lunchtime, one angry Brexiteer MP issued a withering demand that she resign.Ex-minister James Duddridge wrote to the backbench Tory  Committee to call for a no confidence vote in the PM.Branding her incapable of leadership, he said: “Blind loyalty is not the right way forward.”And hours later, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom refused to back Mrs May to lead the Tories into the next general election.She told ITV’s Peston show: “I just think politics is a short-term game. A week changes a lot.”But loyalist Cabinet ministers were delighted with her performance.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab hailed it a “speech laden with leadership”.Torbjörn Sohlström — ambassador for Abba’s homeland of Sweden — was among those to see Mrs May’s attention-grabbing entry to the hall. He tweeted: “I can only say ‘bravo’.”The PM’s robotic dancing became a worldwide phenomenon in August when TV images of her trying to join in with children in Africa went viral.However, councils and campaigners were more impressed with the scrapping of the borrowing cap and the fresh trust ministers were placing on local authorities.Homeless charity Shelter’s boss Polly Neate called it “a major reform that shows real intent to back social house-building”.. Theresa May has a good sense of humour. She stunned Tories by entering the stage dancing to Abba’s Dancing Queen and making gags at her own expense, including a risque nod to steamy BBC drama Bodyguard.. She really cant stand Boris. The PM couldn’t even bring herself to use his name when she swiped out at him over reports he said “f*** business” in response to their Brexit concerns.. Her Chequers Brexit proposal is so toxic she couldnt say the word once in her -minute speech. She also name-checked the NHS more than Brexit -  times to .. She made it clear who wears trousers between her and Downing Street neighbour Philip Hammond, pinching his two big Budget announcements on fuel duty and a house building splurge, plus beating the Chancellor to it to declare an end to austerity.. Mrs May has no intention of standing down soon despite the Cabinet jockeying for her job by trying to renew her domestic vision so it lasts long after Brexit. But Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable, who appeared on a Strictly special in , said: “As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby.“But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her.”Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell dubbed her claim that austerity is over as “a con”.ligtGOT a story  Ring The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or email exclusive@the-sun.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The desperate PM jigged on stage to Abbas Dancing Queen as she admitted for the first time that the Tory civil war over Brexit is harming her ability to get a good deal. Introduced by booming-voiced Tory Geoffrey Cox, she poked fun at Brexiteer Boris Johnson, heaped praise on business and free markets and fearfully attacked Jeremy Corbyn as he inches microscopically closer to power. But with all the over-the-top theatrics in Birmingham, you may have missed some big new policies - that will directly affect your le.  Promising to finally bring an end to eight years of savage Tory cuts, the Prime Minister pledged a poundbillion housing boost and a poundmillion fuel duty freeze. There was also a poignant tale of her goddaughter behind introducing a new cancer screening regime. Here are the things you actually NEED to know from todays big event.  Theresa May announced the first details of a new cancer strategy after poignantly revealing her goddaughter died of the disease. She pledged that by , , more people will be alive five years after diagnosis than today. The age for full bowel cancer screening will drop from  to  in a bid to raise the early detection rate, currently around %, to around % by . Currently a one-off screening is available from age  but screening every two years is only available from age . The NHS will invest in new scanners and build more Rapid Diagnostic Centres – one stop-shops that help people get treatment quicker.  Theresa May’s spokesman said more details of her cancer strategy - including how much it will cost - will only be revealed by the end of the year, when the NHS’s future plan is published. My goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer, she revealed. It came back and last summer sent me a text saying she was hoping to see another Christmas. “But she didn’t make it.” No further details of Mrs Mays goddaughter, including her age or name, have been released, on request of her family. . Fuel duty is frozen for the th time - while other groups suffer  The Tory government will freeze fuel duty for the ninth year in a row, in a move that will cost taxpayerspoundmillion. Scrapping the planned p-a-litre rise will be in the Budget in four weeks time. This is the very first policy from that Budget that weve had confirmed. It will benefit hard-pressed motorists. But it comes as other groups continue to struggle - with working-age benefits still frozen for four years to . Tory officials suggest the average motorist has gained about pound, in total from all the freezes since . Now compare that to the utterly astronomical cost.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the cumulative effect of all those freezes is now costing the Treasury poundbillion a year. Thats more than the affordable housing budget and more than DOUBLE the amount gained by the government by freezing millions of peoples benefits. Greenpeace campaigner Morten Thaysen said: Instead of subsidising diesel and petrol May should be incentivising the take up of cleaner electric vehicles, and ensuring cheap and reliable public transport for all.  The borrowing cap imposed on local councils will be scrapped completely in a move that is expected to raise an extra poundbillion a year for housebuilding. It is a victory for councils after they spent years calling for the move, only to be rebuffed by the Tory government. But it wasnt immediately clear today whether the changes will have to be approved in Parliament.  Housing groups gave a cautious welcome. Chartered Institute of Housing director Gavin Smart said: “This is excellent news and we look forward to seeing the detail. The Federation of Master Builders branded the decision a victory for common sense. Ruth Davison of the National Housing Federation said: For years, everyone who builds affordable homes – both councils and housing associations – have argued this cap on council borrowing puts the brakes on building more homes. . Foreign home buyers will face a new tax  Mrs May revealed plans to slap an extra tax on foreign buyers of UK homes - and pour the proceeds into the governments rough sleeping strategy. A consultation will be launched on putting an extra rate of stamp duty on those who buy a home in the UK, but do not pay tax here. Tory chiefs said a higher % charge was already added to second and buy-to-let homes worth between pound, and pound.million. The new rate has not yet been set. But it would supposedly help youyoure trying to buy a home by wiping out unfair, foreign competition. . Austerity is over - but with a huge catch  The Prime Minister declared austerity is over after eight gruelling years. This isnt a concrete policy but,she keeps her word, itd have a huge impact on your family. The Prime Minister vowed to invest in public services and renew the NHS in her address to the faithful in Birmingham - despite benefits remaining frozen and cuts hitting Universal Credit. But there was a catch. She phrased her speech to say austerity will end AFTER she gets a good Brexit deal. That leaves open the suggestion thatshe DOESNT get a Brexit deal, austerity could simply power on. She said: When we’ve secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the Spending Review next year we will set out our approach for the future.

There was a severe cause of hand, foot and mouth disease spreading, and the staff did their utmost to keep this information quiet. My poor babies were covered in red angry blisters from head to toe, they were so poorly that it completely ruined our holiday. When I approached our Jet rep, they said we dont want to scare our guests, thats why were not telling them. We felt like there was no empathy at all, the hotel just tried to cover it up. As I walked around the resort there were hundreds of cases - I could visibly see the effect it was having on so many other babies and children. When we went to see the hotel doctor, she even said, oh, heres another one! Several other guests had to leave early and ended up in hospital. I dont wish for any family, particularly those with young babies, to have to endure the ordeal we have. There were also many pregnant women at the hotel which is so concerning as the condition can be le threatening for an unborn baby.  Kimberleys claims come after other families have come forward to allege they also have experienced hand, foot and mouth disease symptoms after staying at the hotel.The mum-of-two said she has received hundreds of messages about similar cases since posting about her ordeal on Facebook - some dating back years.The family flew to the Spanish resort on September  and first noticed hand, foot and mouth symptoms in the twins three days later on September . Kimberley said they flew home on September  after being declared fit to fly by the hotel doctor. And Kimberley claims when she took the twins to her GP back in the UK, the doctor told her it was the worst case of the disease they had ever seen. Kimberley also claims the cleanliness of the hotel was not good enough and said after the twins were diagnosed they were banned from the restaurant and pool and told to remain in their room. Hand, foot and mouth the disease is passed on through coughs and sneezes with the NHS stating a person is infectious days before any symptoms become apparent. Kimberley said: The babies were born four weeks premature and have a weakened immune system, so I was so worried about them being ill. Since I posted on Facebook, cases from years ago have been getting in touch with me. We just wish wed been given our right to know. Both our Jet rep and hotel staff lied to our faces - they told us there was a mild case going around and they had only been aware of it for two weeks.  There were no signs throughout the hotel, and we werent advised by staff at check-in or by Jet holidays before arriving. They had a duty of care, but making money was clearly more important to them than the wellbeing of their guests. Its a real shame about the hotel, as its fantastic for children. We feel so let down - both the hotel and Jet have completely failed us and Im disgusted at the way theyve handled it. We still havent had an explanation as to why they deemed it acceptable not to inform guests of this horric outbreak. A spokesperson for Jet said: We are aware of a small number of cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth at the Clu Mac Hotel in Alcudia which, contrary to some reports, first appeared at the hotel in September. Since the appearance of these cases, we have briefed our team on how to spot and prevent the spread of th illness and displayed posters on notice boards in the hotel. We would like to assure our customers that their health and safety is our number one priority, and we work closely with all hotels to ensure that health and safety standards meet the very high requirements that we and our customers expect. Vicente Gim nez, general manager at Club Mac Hotel Alcudia, said: We are aware of a small number of cases of hand-foot-and-mouth at the Club Mac Hotel in Alcudia and were working with our resort teams and customers to do everything possible to reduce the spread of this highly contagious viral infection.

Gemma Evans, , is accused of using Facebook and WhatsApp to send messages while driving in the dark at mph. A jury heard she was grossly distracted causing her black Mini to veer into the path of Diane Price, , who was killed outright. Police seized Evanss mobile phone and found a series of messages allegedly sent while driving.  Prosecutor Thomas Scapens said: Experts have concluded there were no medical or mechanical reasons for Gemma Evans to leave her lane. She did not see the car approaching and did not brake before leaving her lane. We examined her mobile phone and found she was using it up to the point of collision. Evans was driving to work at .am on Friday  December  while Mrs Price was coming the other way after spending the night caring for her elderly father. The court heard Evanss Mini suddenly veered across the road on a straight stretch of the A, near Brecon, Powys. Other motorists and paramedics gave CPR but Ms Price died of catastrophic injuries at the scene. The jury was given a print-out of Evanss mobile phone activity in the minutes before the crash near the village of Llanspyddyd.  It showed she exchanged messages with friend Kirsty Arrowsmith making arrangements for a girls night out and signed off with cheeky monkey and thumbs up emojis. Mr Scapens said: The first message from Miss Arrowsmith at .am said: Hey you, drinking tonight or having a quiet one  Miss Evans replied with four heart emojis saying: Overslept along with a cheeky monkey face and three kisses. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard the two friends swapped messages about what they were going to wear on the night out.

Roughly the size of Neptune, it is  times bigger than our own satellite - and is some , light years away. To date there are more than , exoplanets - worlds orbiting stars other than the Sun - but no exomoons. Dr David Kipping, an Assistant Professor at Columbia University in New York, said: This would be the first case of detecting a moon outside our solar system.  If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets. The hunt for exomoons - which are just as likely to harbour le - has run parallel to that for moons. But these extrasolar satellites had lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques. Columbia colleague Alex Teachey say they now have compelling evidence for one - thanks to its large size. They believe its orbiting a gas giant. Almost  moons have been identied in our own star system - and none are anywhere near as gargantuan. Using the Kepler space telescope the researchers analysed data from  exoplanets which had wide orbits - periods greater than  days - around their host star.  The observations measured the momentary dimming of starlight as a planet passed in front of its star - called a transit. One planet called Kepler b had intriguing anomalies. Dr Kipping explained: We saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention. The results were enough for the team to get  hours of time with NASAs Hubble to intensively study the planet - supplying them with data four times more precise. They monitored the planet before and during its -hour-long transit across the face of the star. After it ended the telescope detected a second and much smaller decrease in the stars brightness three-and-a-half hours later. Dr Kipping said this was consistent with a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash. He said: Unfortunately, the scheduled Hubble observations ended before the complete transit of the moon could be measured. The study, published in the journal Science Advances, also provided supporting evidence for the moon by discovering the planet began its transit  minutes earlier than predicted.  This suggested both it and the moon were orbiting a common centre of gravity - known in astronomy as the barycentre - that would cause the planet to wobble from its expected location. Dr Kipping said: An extraterrestrial civilisation watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earths transit. In principle this anomaly could be caused by the gravitational pull of a hypothetical second planet in the system. But Kepler found no evidence for additional planets around the star during its four-year mission, said the researchers. Lead author Mr Teachey, a graduate fellow in astronomy, said: A companion moon is the simplest and most natural explanation for the second dip in the light curve and the orbit-timing deviation. It was a shocking moment to see that light curve - my heart started beating a little faster and I just kept looking at that signature. But we knew our job was to keep a level head testing every conceivable way in which the data could be tricking us until we were left with no other explanation.

Another witness, Gordon Cobb, said he heard Mrs Carter screaming: My daughter, my girl or my baby, and added: I could see a little girls head sticking out of the wave, physically there was no way she could have got through the wave. I had to watch her drt out to sea.

Talented Chy Peart, , was discovered by her firefighter husband Mark but despite his efforts at CPR she sadly died. Chy was pronounced dead by paramedics at the couple’s home, in Rotherham, South Yorks, on April . In a statement, read at Doncaster Coroner’s Court by coroners officer David Copley, Mr Peart said he had been working a day sht at Manvers Fire Station. I arrived home at about .pm and the house was in darkness, he said. “I discovered Chy hanging. The inquest heard how Chy, who taught at Rawmarsh Community School and also ran a textiles business, was signed off work by her GP Dr Biing Hen on a number of occasions dating back to November .  Helen O’Brien, headteacher at Rawmarsh Community School, described Chy as a ‘positive role model for students’ and a ‘very, very talented textiles teacher’. Mrs O’Brien took Chy to the hospital on November , last year, after she told another member of staff she’d had suicidal thoughts on the journey to work. The court also heard she attempted to take her le in February, information which was not shared with the school. In March, Dr Hen said Chy became ‘annoyed’ by a letter from an occupational therapist which labelled her as ‘emotionally immature’, something her mother, who was present in court, said ‘changed her completely’. Mrs O’Brien said: “Chy disagreed and contested with the occupational health report. I said I would speak to her GP to get a second opinion. “The door was kept open – at no point was Chy told she wouldn’t be able toto school.”  The court also heard Chy had ‘hopes of having a child’ but that she had told a mental health worker that she felt like she was stuck in a hamster wheel of everything’. Assistant coroner for Doncaster, Louise Slater questioned the use of the phrase ‘emotionally immature’ and said it was not a ‘medical diagnosis’. Recording a narrative verdict, Mrs Slater said she could not record a conclusion of suicide as she said the evidence she had heard did not prove Chy intended to take her own le. “Chy was a good teacher,” said Mrs Slater. “She was liked and respected by her peers, certainly the management and , although not here, I suspect the pupils as well and probably their parents. ”But it would appear from the evidence that Chy found it dficult to accept that she was actually quite good at what she did. “She was always striving to be better and perhaps she was a bit of a perfectionist.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry comforts upset little","story":"NewsPrince Harry comforts upset little boy crying because he had to meet him instead of Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle and Prince Harry visited Sussex today for the first time since they were named Duke and Duchess of the county on their wedding dayShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video poor-kid-missed-out-meghan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLots of people have a favourite member of the Royal Family who they would love to meet and have a quick chat with.

The alien creatures seemed to be descendants of human beings that could communicate with telepathy, he says. Despite this William claims he was able to talk to them in English.  He said: Everyone spoke in fluent English. They all had implanted in them a chip which instantly brain scans and translates words into whatever language was most comfortable for them.

She went on to explain that her main reason for turning her friend down was that she was only a few months out of her own wedding and she just wanted to enjoy being a newlywed for a little while.  The whole experience of planning her big day meant shed now happily never be a bridesmaid again to avoid all the wedding admin. She added that traditionally bridesmaids were unmarried women celebrating the next chapter in a brides le, and while that may not be the case today, she didnt see anything wrong with prioritising the next chapter of her le.

Doctors told his -year-old mum Isabela Gillado her baby was unlikely to survive past two weeks during her first ultasound in July last year.But after a long fight and contrary to the prognosis, Matthew is celebrating his first birthday on October . The rare congenital disorder means the flat bones in the cranial vault within the skull are either completely or partially absent.  Raven said: We wanted to feel the physical presence of our baby, hug and kiss him. We named him Matthew as it means a gt from God. During the first month of Isabella’s pregnancy, she had a fever and took bioflu, an over-the-counter capsule containing phenylephrine HCI, chlorphenamine maleate and paracetamol, for one week. They believe this may have had some impact on the baby’s facial deformation. Matthew was born via cesarean section in a hospital in Santiago town in northern Philippines.  He said: When I first saw our baby, I trembled, felt weak and almost collapsed inside the delivery room. He was almost faceless. The next day, despite his condition, baby Matthew was discharged while Isabela was left at the intensive care unit for two weeks. Isabela continues to feed him drops of milk and vitamins for him to stay healthy and he is now celebrating his first birthday on October . Meanwhile Raven is working at a clothes factory in Balintawak, Quezon City earning  per day, around poundper month, which is barely enough for the family to survive. Despite the family’s below minimum wage income, support from relatives and the public help them afford daily basic needs for Matthews survival.

We suspect that the lions were all poisoned at the same time, but the poachers were disturbed by the security guards before they could get to the other lions.

As a team, when we were losing, we didn’t really let that get to us.“I know we’ve been under pressure having not won but as a team we’ve been positive.“We always knew we wanted to get that goal first and we showed what we can do when we get in front.

Hamilton will have said, ‘get a goal against them and they’re dead’ but the players were well fired up on Saturday, I didn’t have to do anything.“When the goal goes in from Boyle, great delivery from Calvin Miller, you know you have something tangible to hang on to.“I’m so pleased, I don’t want to go overboard because it is only three points but it is a big three points for the club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these were csaba laszlos last words as dundee united boss","story":"Deep inside the bowels of Tannadice was where Csaba Laszlo carried out one of his last acts as Dundee United manager, speaking to the press after his team hit self destruct in losing - to Ross County on Saturday.Csaba was quizzed on where it all went wrong for him, not just on the day, but over the course of his near year-long reign as the sense he was a dead man walking filled the air.He was down and seemed defeated when laying out his defence and it was clear it was going to be the last time he spoke as the manager of Dundee United Football Club.Askedhe had considered resigning, he said: “I don’t think resigning is an option but it was a terrible result.“The team know that and we have to take the responsibility for it.“It wasn’t just one or two people # it’s the full team who have to take the responsibility.“I don’t think we are so bad going by results but we lost five goals at home.“Especially being so positive after the Falkirk game, we were % going into this dficult run.“We knew it wasn’t going to be easy but we showed real confidence and the injured players have slowly been coming back.“We wanted to avoid a result like Saturday – it’s not what we wished for.”Csaba did confirm that, as ever, he would speak with chairman Mike Martin which ultimately led to him being sacked on Sunday afternoon.The Hungarian also conceded he and the players had let the fans down with the display and recent struggles.He added: “I believe in my players and they feel the same after losing the game.“They don’t want to push the responsibility away – it’s not that easy.

Last year he had two games in the hotseat after Ray McKinnon was sacked and led the team back to the top of the ision via impressive victories over eventual champions St Mirren and away to Dumbarton.At the time that prompted the board to urge him to apply for the job permanently but Ellis felt he lacked the experience to take on a club of United’s size.A year on that view might have changed and, was he to succeed Csaba, he would be a popular appointment in the dressing-room.The fact he’s a leading contender is further indication of how highly he is rated by his employers. While it was hoped Csaba would be the man to lead the team back to the Premiership, for some time now the former Raith Rovers stalwart has been viewed by many within Tannadice as a future boss.That said he does face competition from others with more experience and both Neilson and McIntyre will be interested.The pair could need convincing the Tangerines can succeed.Although he’s been out of a job since ending a dficult spell in England with MK Dons in January, Neilson’s stock north of the border remains high.As head coach of Hearts for two years from , he guided the Tynecastle outfit to promotion from a Championship that included hot favourites Rangers and Edinburgh rivals Hibs.On a tight budget, he then steered them to a top-six finish and Europa League qualication in their first season back in the Premiership.McIntyre has considerable experience from his time in charge at Dunfermline, Queen of the South and Ross County, where he lted the League Cup.He’s been out of a job since being sacked by the Staggies in September last year.While it’s known both are keen to get back in management, they’ll onlyin the right circumstances.In August, McIntyre turned down the offer to succeed Paul Hartley at Falkirk. He felt the budget there would not be sufficient to mount a promotion challenge.Likewise, earlier in the summer the vacant post at St Mirren was there for the taking for Neilson.After talks with the board, the -year-old decided their expectations were unrealistic and the job wasn’t for him."},{"url":null,"title":"vandals target the same vehicle on local road three times in six weeks","story":"Vandals have targeted the same vehicle parked on a local road three times in the past six weeks.Police Scotland has issued an appeal after the vehicle, parked in Fairport Road, suffered damage to the bodywork after being scratched.A statement said: #Anyone with any information should contact Police Scotland on , quoting CR   or speak to any police officers.#Alternativelyyou have any information about the incident you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers % anonymously on    or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org.#"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"its-time-to-get-booking-your-next-christmas-party-venue","story":"Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

There was something for that Orange is the New Black fan, some Riverdale-style Serpent jackets spotted, and the s horror genre is still alive and well, ironically.This year#s convention featured a lot of zombies in costume and in the events. A  of The Walking Dead stars was made up of Jayson Warner Smith, Lew Temple and Joshua Mikel to chat about the show as well as Aaronand Ezekiel .In a  made up of Walking Dead#s Khary Payton, Adventure Time#s Jeremy Shada, Animaniac#s Jess Harnell, The Last of Us# Troy Baker, Uncharted#s Nolan North and Bravehheart#s Angus MacFadyen reading Braveheart#s script in whatever whacky toon voice they could muster.Gaming and Batman voice actor Troy Baker expressed a little-known talent when he came on stage with a guitar.And then there were the rows after rows of artists, writers, crafters, and whatever  you can think of. You want a cupcake that looks like Cookie Monster  An original graphic novel  A Spider-Man bathbomb  You#ll find it.The passion for the arts is the main draw though.

It was just another average day at Doonfoot Primary, until a bat managed to fly off piste and get its teeny wing wedged in a window frame. Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.  Janitor Brian said: “We knew it was there during the day but we just thought it was hanging there. “But parents said to me later on that it was still there. “We contacted the Bat Society to see what we should do as we knew they were protected. “It’s wing had actually been caught, so I had to go up beside Mr Hall and prise the window frame open with a screwdriver. “We put it into a box then Mr Hall gave it some water and later on that night we released it.” Rory added: “I spent a couple of hours and stayed with it to make sure it was calm and relaxed. “I gave it a solution of salt, sugar and warm water, which the Bat Society gave us, and it was like an energy drink for him. “Half an hour after that, I took it out and hung it out at the sensory garden and off it flew.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13347961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_nip_rgr_041018flowers_1JPG.jpg","title":"caring toryglen grans who set","story":"NewsCaring Toryglen grans who set up club for pensioners are honoured in new Reformer competitionShareByNiki Tennant:,  OCT NewsCathy and Suzanne were delighted with their flowers, presented by Cathys daughter Meika \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo caring grans, who have opened up a new world of fun and friendship for Toryglen pensioners, have become the first recipients of stunning bouquets in the Reformer’s new Say it with Flowers competition.When Meika Thomson read that the Rutherglen Reformer wanted to say ‘thanks a bunch’ every week to unsung heroeswho make a real dference to their community, she didn’t hesitate to nominate her mum Cathy and best friend Suzanne Curran for a beautul bouquet from Burnside florist, Stems.Cathy and Suzanne, who have run the Toryglen After School Care club for  years, refused to turn the other cheek when they saw pensioners from a neighbouring sheltered housing complex staying indoors, living in isolation and lacking company and companionship. Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Strictly Come Dancing has been watched by millions across the country since  with viewers voting for their favourite celebrity to be crowned winner. But before the television dance contest took over our Saturday night evening watch, viewers got their ballroom fix from the series Come Dancing, which later reformed becoming the follow-up show we know today as Strictly. Back when the show aired on and off on the BBC from  to , it featured professional contestants and not celebrities. Doonfoot’s Janet Stirling danced on the original Come Dancing series as a member of the West of Scotland formation team. Now the dance queen is displaying her gowns at a special showcase in the Carnegie Library in Ayr for fans of the series. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet relived her dancing days. She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural. Janet admitted Ballroom was always her favourite style of dancing, and she was sad when the Come Dancing series had come to an end. She added: “I missed it but I still enjoy watching it.” You can view Janet’s dresses at the Carnegie Library until October .

But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”. Girvan Community Council will be discussing the issue at this month’s meeting.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

Obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, responsible for , cases in Scotland every year.However there was also confusion as ministers last night climbed down on a ban on diners receiving free prawn crackers and poppadoms with take-away and restaurant meals.Despite an explicit reference to them in the consultation, the government said the savoury foods were exempt when part of a main meal.A spokesman said: ldquoIt is not our intention to restrict restaurants from including savoury foods, such as prawn crackers or poppadoms, as part of meals."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-needs-more-clarity-on-brexit-before-sharing-indyref2-plans","story":"The Scottish First Minister said the lack of detail surrounding the UKs departure from the European Union meant she was unable to make a judgment on whether to call for another independence vote.She insisted this was the case despite fears that Britain could be heading for a \"genuinely disastrous Brexit outcome\" - and even warned that Theresa Mays almost \"dysal\" government could lead to a snap general election.The SNP leader said: \"It may be this government is not far away from being unable to govern, I say that in seriousness.\"She noted the \"circus that is unfolding\" at the Tory party conference in Brimingham, where there has been speculation that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge.Ms Sturgeon added: \"We are talking about a party in government that is not far away, I think, from being dysal, in terms of being able to govern at all.\"I certainly dont think we should rule out the fact that there might be a general election.\"However she was clear that more detail is still needed on the UKs future relationship with the EU before she can decide on whether to press for another vote on Scottish independence.Ms Sturgeon had previously indicated her willingness to fight a second referendum following the Brexit result in , when Scotland voted to remain part of the EU but the UK as a whole opted to leave.However she pulled back from that position after the SNP lost a number of Westminster seats in the  general election - at the time pledging to set out her thinking on the issue in October.Speaking at the th anniversary of the Europa Institute at Edinburgh University, the First Minister said that while Scotland \"must retain the option to choose a dferent course as an independent member of the EU\", she said that would be \"when there is greater clarity about the terms of Brexit than exists today\".She said the \"decisive moments\" of the negotiations were now approaching, adding that the Scottish Government would publish a further document ahead of the key EU Council meeting in October \"setting out the case for compromise and common sense\".Ms Sturgeon stressed her administration would continue to make the case for the UK to remain in both the single market and the customs union - even though this has been repeatedly ruled out by Westminster.The First Minister was asked directly by a member of the audienceshe would call for a second independence votethe UK \"crashes out with no deal\".But she responded that she would set out her thinking when there is sufficient information on the UKs future relationship with the EU.The First Minister said that she would \"wait until we are at this phase of the negotiations before effectively sharing my view on what I think where we are at that stage means for Scotland and the question of an independence referendum\".She continued: \"The end of this period of negotiation, I previously thought that would be October. It is now looking like that is more likely to be November, perhaps with a vote in the House of Commons in December.\"So I will take a judgment depending on where we get to, set out some views on where I think were headingwe dont change course, and have more to say on that that point.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-declares-end-to-austerity-as-she-urges-party-to-come-together-to-deliver-good-brexit-deal","story":"In her crucial keynote speech to the Conservative conference in Birmingham, the Prime Minister said next years post-Brexit Spending Review would set out a programme of increased investment for public services, as a mark that the decade of cuts following the financial crash was coming to an end.And she announced a new cancer strategy to increase early detection of the illness and save , lives a year by , along with a ninth successive annual freeze in fuel duty.Admitting that the housing market is \"broken\", she announced she was lting the cap on councils borrowing to fund new developments, with the aim of \"building the homes this country needs\".In a speech designed to rally her party behind her following a conference riven by dferences over Brexit, Mrs May warned that squabbling over the details of EU withdrawal might meant \"ending up with no Brexit at all\".Standing firmly by the Chequers Plan, which was denounced by Boris Johnson as a \"constitutional outrage\", the Tory leader promised: \"If we stick together and hold our nerve, I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.\"She made no direct mention of the former Foreign Secretary, who won thunderous applause from , activists on Tuesday as he called on her to \"chuck\" the Brexit plan agreed at her country residence in July.But she delivered a stinging thinly-veiled attack on him by delivering a riposte to his reported \"f*** business\" comment, saying the business community should know that \"there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you - it has a single syllable, it is of Anglo-Saxon derivation, it ends in the letter K. Back businesses.\"Less than an hour before taking the stage in Birmingham, Mrs May was hit by a call for her removal from former minister James Duddridge, who said she was \"incapable\" of providing the leadership Tories need.But she did her best to appear carefree as she sashayed on to the stage to the Abba hit Dancing Queen - a reference to the much-shared video of her dancing on a trip to Africa - and joked about the coughing fit and collapsing stage backdrop which marred her calamitous conference speech in Manchester last year.In an upbeat message to activists and voters, the PM declared: \"If we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands.\"She launched a ferocious assault on Jeremy Corbyns Labour, describing the takeover of the party by the left as \"a national tragedy\" and his policies of nationalisation and shares for workers as \"bogus solutions that would makes things worse\".And Mrs May branded Nicola Sturgeon a traitor to Scotland by seeking to lock Scottish fishermen into the Common Fisheries Policy forever. ldquoThatrsquos not lsquoStronger for Scotland,rsquo itrsquos a betrayal of Scotland, she declared.In a clear pitch for mainstream voters turned off by Mr Corbyns left-wing economic agenda and rows over anti-Semitism, she said she wanted the \"decent, moderate and patriotic\" Conservatives to be \"a party for the whole country\".The PM made a grab for traditionally Labour territory by saying that the NHS \"embodies our principles as Conservatives\" and boasting of the presence in the Tory front ranks of immigrants son Sajid Javid, former Barnardos girl Esther McVey and lesbian mother-to-be Ruth Davidson.In the face of Labours appeal to those suffering from the effects of austerity, Mrs May said Tories must \"defend free markets, because it is ordinary working people who benefit\".But she acknowledged that, a decade after the  crash, the after-effects were still being felt by many households.\"Some markets are still not working in the interests of ordinary people,\" said the Tory leader.\"Employment is up but too many people havent had a decent pay rise.

But in Birmingham Boris had to do with a side hall, a mere capacity of ,, and it was filled to the brim.His speech was, as ever, full of rhetorical flourishes, the occasional classical reference, and the demonisation of those nasty Marxists, who lead the Labour Party or, as the Old Etonian put it, the s Tony Benn tribute band.But, besides his excoriation of the ldquooutrageous, democracy-denying Chequers Plan, there was not much . Yet the Brexit brethren led by the Boristocrats like Bone, Patel and IDS lapped it up. It was, purred one afterwards, a ldquospeech from our next leader.Yet Mrs May less than  hours later delivered arguably her best conference speech, taking bites out of Corbyn and Sturgeon, taking a sideways swipe at Boris, and announcing a number of new announcements on not hiking fuel duty and opening the way to more council house homes in England.But it was her declaration that the age of austerity was over with the promise, post-Brexit, of a loosening of the purse string to boost public services that caught the attention.It appeared to keep the troops, most of them, happy as the country now girds its loins for a critical period.The ldquomoment of truth, as Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, put it, is just two weeks away.The PM has got a tweak to Chequers on customs ready but is not yet saying what it is. The idea of having ldquoregulatory checks instead of customs ones at Irish Sea ports has already been knocked back by the DUPrsquos Arlene Foster, who, of course, holds Mrs Mayrsquos parliamentary majority in the palm of her hand.The suggestion at conference was thatthe PM came away emptied-handed from the October   European Council, Boris would take the opportunity to strike.But a it is arguable he will get the  Tory MP signatures needed to spark a leadership challenge and b it is even more arguable there will be enough Conservative colleagues to put him on the final ballot paper. \"Hes a busted flush and always has been,\" said one MP.It seems clear that heading Operation Arse to stop Boris will be Ms Davidson and David Mundell. Private polling for the party has shown that the one thing that could kill off the Scottish Tory leaderrsquos bid to oust Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister is a Johnson premiership.Imagine how it would be. Ms Davidson, a Remainer, having to watch as her UK leader, an ardent Leaver, pursues a hard Brexit in his idiosyncratic ldquoself-serving way. Every week, possibly every day, the Edinburgh MSP will have to face the barbs of the SNP, Scottish Labour et al as they goad her over her colleaguersquos latest controversial move.Plus, can anyone ever remember Boris defending the Union that is so close to Ms Davidsonrsquos heart  Did he ever venture to Scotland during the two years the Tories were battling to stave off the break-up of Britain So,a hard Brexit were not bad enough for Remainers Davidson and Mundell, one led by what they regard as bumbling Boris would be, frankly, intolerable."},{"url":null,"title":"queensferry-crossing-needs-second-year-of-snagging-repairs","story":"The Scottish Tories said ministers had been \"premature\" to open the suspension bridge over the Forth to traffic in August  after the latest delays were announced.Contractors estimated in January that corrective snagging work should finish by September.However in a letter to Holyroodrsquos rural connectivity committee, quango Transport Scotland said the work was now expected to run until October .Major projects director Michelle Rennie said the contractor, Forth Crossing Bridges Constructorshad ldquoexperienced dficulties in mobilising resources and this has had a ldquosignicant impact on the progress of repairs.There had also been problems with a safe  under the road deck, while work on the three towers and cables would not start until next spring to avoid bad winter weather.The list of snagging includes work on road lighting, drainage, wind barriers, painting, a load verication system and electrical and mechanical work inside the road deck.She said there would be no extra cost to the public or impact on average journey times.However she told MSPs it may be necessary to ldquoundertake routine maintenance works as part of the ongoing operation of the road network.Scottish Tory transport spokesman Jamie Greene said the SNPrsquos ldquohurried approach had been driven by public relations concerns, and could lead to trouble down the line.He said: ldquoTherersquos never been a back-patting session quite like it from the nationalists after the Queensferry Crossing was officially unveiled last year.ldquoBut now we learn the substantial backlog of snagging works will continue well into the autumn of next year, two years after it originally opened.ldquoThe Queensferry Crossing is a magnicent piece of work, butjourney times have not improved and motorists are facing years of roadworks, you can understand scepticism around this flagship project.Scottish LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton, whose Edinburgh seat includes the bridgersquos southern approach, said: ldquoI am proud of the crossing which connects my constituency to Fe, but when we first uncovered how far it was from being completed, we were accused of talking Scotland down.\"Now we learn it is going to take an additional  months.\"The finishing touches will not be in place until almost two years after the bridge opened.

Leaving will allow us to better deliver for our fishing communities around the country. The Prime Minister showed today that she has the energy, the drive and the plan to take Britain and Scotland forward.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said no one would believe the PMrsquos claim that austerity was about to end, given service cuts, children in poverty and more rough sleeping.He said: ldquoAusterity is a political choice from the Tories to shrink the role of the welfare state in the United Kingdom.

We want something that can rival what a lot of European cities are offering at the moment. We want something to rival the kind of integrated service that you get in London, where your buses, your trains and subway all work together to serve the whole city.\"We feel things are weighted toward private bus companies. And when you compare what happens in Edinburgh to Glasgow, we see that as clear evidence of where public ownership works and works in favour of passengers.The petition, which was launched following anger over fare increases of up to  percent introduced by First Bus in January, also calls for affordable, integrated ticketing, with a city-wide smartcard and daily price cap.It calls for bike-hire stations across the city, with free access for concessionary card holders.They want a publicly-owned Transport Authority for Glasgow, with power over the entire transport network.And it calls for a \"coordinated, long-term vision and investment\" to meet the cityrsquos transport needs.Friends of the Earth Scotland air pollution campaigner Emilia Hanna said: ldquoPassengers are here to show that there is huge demand for public ownership of buses. The Transport Bill gives Parliament a fantastic opportunity to transform the way buses are run.\"People are very angry at poor bus services across many areas in Scotland. Fares are going up while services are being cut and itrsquos not surprising that passenger numbers are falling dramatically.ldquoBy increasing bus use we can cut air pollution and congestion, reduce climate emissions, and make our towns and cities better places to spend time.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said pound, in total would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotThursday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808556.1538487783!/image/image.jpg","title":"motorhome business cashes in on north coast 500 success","story":"A Highland motorhome company has signalled further growth thanks to the popularity of the North Coast  route.North  Motorhomes, which is based in Inverness, is in the process of growing its fleet and expanding into the Central Belt after a successful second season.The firm has now invested more than £ million in its fleet of motorhomes and site in the city.The company’s operations director Colin Harrison said: “Our first year was really about dipping our toe in the market and testing the level of demand.

One of the things which I’ve liked best is writing these columns I see myself as a charming old gentproducing harmless copy for your amusement and thus had been the case until my last piece. This was the one where I suggested that some young people were cleverer than others. This seems to me to be completely self-evident, just like saying that some people are taller, or sing better, or have blue eyes. : Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersHowever, it received more reaction than all the other pieces put together, ranging from praise – describing me as “brave” – to others who felt my points were “not helpful” or “elitist”. What’s going on  All I said was something which we all know.What I didn’t say was anything about what causes some young people to be more intelligent. I think it’s probably something genetic and something to do with upbringing andI had to state a more definite view I’d go with a   split, having observed plenty of parents and their kids over the years. But that wasn’t my point and I doubtthere’s anything like a definitive answer.Also, what I didn’t say was that intelligence was the be all and end all. I really, really don’t believe that. Even in the unashamedly academic school I worked in, we spent all our time encouraging the students to work hard and to be kind to each other. We didn’t make hierarchical gods out of clever boys and girls any more than we did of the best football players or the most talented trumpeters. It was very clear indeed all the way through my career that lots of other factors apart from intelligence affected young people’s performance. In his book in the “All That Matters” series on “Intelligence”, the Edinburgh academic Dr Stuart Ritchie makes it clear that intelligence is quite definitely not all that matters: “Being bright is critically important [to educational achievement], but so are other characteristics like conscientiousness, motivation and self-control, as well as ious social skills.”Dr Ritchie is a wee bit scathing about the idea of other “intelligences” but we know the kinds of thingsits proponents are talking about. I would say I was quite clever but a car engine, say, is a thing of which I am deeply frightened. I greatly admire the ability of someone who can fix them and I think it’s perfectly reasonable to see it as a dferent ‘intelligence’ evenit doesn’t help in getting Higher French. Similarly with “emotional intelligence”, though I’m not very sure how you measure that ...Another thing I didn’t say was that intelligence made you happy. Anyone who has taught or been a GP or a lawyer or a social worker or a minister of religion has met loads and loads of miserable clever people. If there is a recipe for happiness, I can’t think it would involve a high IQ, rather than, say, lots of friends, several units of alcohol and a high-end doughnut shop. I’m not good at working out visual-spatial problemsbut I can’t really say it’s ever made me unhappy, apart from the odd bumped nose.: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertNo, I didn’t say any of these things. I said that some people were more intelligent than others, and I think the education system isn’t erse enough to cope with the range of abilities it’s presented with. I think that Scotland needs to examine, radically and soon, the way we educate the cleverest and least clever children in our society, because currently the former are bored, unstretched and not reaching their potential and the latter are struggling with meaningless work, and they are also bored and not reaching their potential. Again, this is not because of teachers, who almost universally work very hard and really care about their charges. It’s about education policy and the wish of government, over a long period, to see education as a social experiment rather than education. The other thing is that parents really worry about their children’s intelligence but they don’t say so, whether their child is Stephen Hawking or, well, let’s say, “someone less intelligent” in order to avoid unpleasantness in the comments section. I well remember my Parents’ Night interview with Professor and Mrs Lecter, about their son.“To be honest, this has not been a great term for Hannibal. It began with that unfortunate incident in Home Economics, where he brought the wrong ingredients for the recipe and also failed to tidy up properly. Then in Biology where he misunderstood the instructions during the dissection we are all very lucky that the injury to the other boy was only superficial, and we have taken on board your views on risk management.

The partnership will see it offer up to £, to “outstanding Pioneers”, as well as dedicated access to the oil major’s facilities and expertise.Over the next four months the TechX Pioneer campaign will visit cities including Edinburgh, Manchester and London in the UK and Boston and Houston in the US to encourage tech start-ups internationally to apply for a place on the programme.The launch of the second annual programme comes hot on the heels of the graduation of the first cohort of TechX Pioneers last month. During the -week programme, ten companies experienced business mentoring, were provided with co-working space, access to rapid prototyping, test facilities, large-scale field trials and showcase events.David Millar, TechX director, said: “The first year of the TechX Pioneer programme was a huge success with our cohort of ten start-ups.“We are delighted to be opening applications once again to see what technology ideas are put forward and who our next cohort of start-ups starting the -week intensive programme next spring will be.”David Gilmour, vice-president, business development, BP Group Technology, added: “The TechX initiative has been a success, with year one uncovering some breakthrough thinking and innovation that we believe could help transform the energy sector, not just in the North Sea but across the globe.“One of BP Ventures’ core principles is to identy and invest in game-changing technology companies that are accelerating cutting edge innovations across the entire energy spectrum. TechX ticks all these boxes.”Ross Macleod, founder of Intelt, one of the newly graduated Pioneers and winner of a performance award of £,, said: “Being accepted onto the TechX Pioneer programme was a game-changer for us as a small, technology start-up company.“The access we received to business mentors, industry insight, not to mention the funding to develop our business and tech was fantastic.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4809148.1538571199!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may accuses nicola sturgeon of betraying scotland over fishing","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Prime Minister Theresa May has attacked Nicola Sturgeon over the First Minister#s approach to Scotland#s fishing industry post-Brexit, accusing her of #betraying# Scotland.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.

In the meantime there has been an impasse in talks over funding between Highland Council and resort owners Macdonald Hotels.The council has stressed it remains open to discussions and the hotel operator told the Strathy yesterday it intends to re-open the talks early next week.There was a unanimous feeling at the SOS meeting that the community needs to show its support for the provision of swimming at the resort rather than wait for any resolution which may not come.It was stressed that this must be in a positive manner with the emphasis put on how important access is to the pool rather than it becoming confrontational.Pool users, HLH members and the wider public are being asked to meet at .pm later today at the layby at the bottom of the resorts brae to highlight their concern over the loss of swimming.A big colourful banner and  fliers have been produced.

He could not understand why locals should not be able to access the pool facilities at this time.He said: \"I work with sustainable tourism myself. This does not sound like sustainable tourism to me.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative.

This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit.  by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046550.jpg--.jpg?1537864027000\n","title":"ballymena rockers out to spread some joy","story":"A new rocking phenomenon is taking Ballymena by storm in the form of finding and creating little painted rocks hid around the town.Ballymena Rocks was born out of an idea by local woman Doreen Armstrong who became involved with Rocks NI after finding little painted rocks around Portrush and enquiring what their purpose was.The idea is that people paint rocks with colour and add some words of inspiration and then hide or leave them around public places such as parks or town centres to bring a smile to the person who finds them with the Ballymena Rocks Facebook page already having over  members, all creating, hiding and finding rocks around the town.Doreen was keen to bring the practice to Ballymena after having great fun finding and creating her own rocks over the Summer in Portrush. Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’. Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      UFU welcomes speed limit at local schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"A spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.The church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.

Walkers and cyclists will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of fresh air and exercise along an extended riverside trail, linking parkland off Bridge Street to the attractive Woodlands Park, thanks to the commencement of Phase  of the Gilford Riverside Trail project.The extended trail will provide an off-road route linking both ends of the town and passing the iconic Gilford Mill buildings along the way.Work on the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council project is due to start in mid-October with completion scheduled for Spring .Part of the riverside trail will run on top of the old millrace, continuing between the river and the in-filled mill pond, past the former Gilford mill buildings joining with a new footbridge over the mill race into Woodlands Park. The installation of new seating, lighting and landscaping along the route will help make the trail accessible to all.It has been a goal for many years to connect all council owned open space along the river and this latest set of works is the final piece of the jigsaw which has been made possible thanks to £, funding secured from SOARVillage Renewal Measure.During the course of the works some disruption to the area may be necessary including the temporary closure of the footbridge at Gilford Community Centre and certain access points to the park.

The centre has been part of the Upper Springfield since  but it has changed and developed since then. I came onboard around two years ago and the centre is really about addressing the physical and mental health needs of the area.”The Healthy Living Centre is one of many successful projects managed by the Upper Springfield Development Trustwith physical activity classes including boxercise, zumba, pilates and circuit classes running in Corpus Christi parish church hall throughout the week. “We are open to what people want to do,” added Rosie, “we have an extremely popular Couch to K initiative and we have armchair aerobics as well for those less abled.“We also offer a counselling service here, the space here is really utilised. We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health. It can’t be stressed enough how important it is in today’s society, there is something for everyone at the centre and we are here to offer advice and guidance where we can.”For more information and a class timetable go towww.facebook UpperSpringfieldHealthyLivingCentre"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"THE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted  responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.Mr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning.

It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights.

Arron said that the hedge sits lower than the road, so they couldnt be seen.He believes it is there that the pregnant animal was hung up on barbed wire to be skinned and had its legs cut off in the barbaric attack.\"You can see the clean lines of the kne, and the wool and the skin was cut off - not pulled off,\" he said last night.Arron explained he had been trying to build up his flock, but now another of his sheep has lambed early because of what he believes is trauma.The lorry driver said he was keeping the horric story from his two young children - a son and daughter aged seven and six respectively - as it was too disturbing.He described those behind the grim attack as \"total scum to do this to an innocent animal\", which he believed would have suffered.\"How anyone could do this to an animal is beyond me,\" he said. \"Someone knew what they were doing.\"This wasnt a five minute job.\"It wasnt a pretty sight to come across this morning,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp mla calls for arlene foster to resign over good friday agreement comments","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

It could could be the size of Neptune, according to a report by Alex Teachey @alexteachey and David Kipping @david_kipping in @ScienceAdvances. https:t.co daVPXdpYBw pic OdNqtnNga— Columbia UniversityOctober , Two Columbia University researchers presented their tantalising evidence for a moon on Wednesday.The potential moon would be considerably larger than Earth, about the size of Neptune or Uranus.The planet it orbits is as big as mammoth Jupiter.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A deep sky image from the Hubble Space Telescope This apparent super-size pairing of a gaseous moon and planet is , light-years away.Researchers Alex Teachey and David Kipping evaluated  planets outside our solar system that had already been discovered by Nasa’s Kepler Space Telescope.Only one planet held promise for hosting a moon, one around the star known as Kepler-, which is about the size of our sun but older.So last October, the pair directed the Hubble Space Telescope at the star in an attempt to very, or rule out, the possibility of a moon orbiting the planet Kepler-b.They were on the lookout for a second temporary dimming of starlight.The main dip in stellar brightness would be the planet itself crossing in front of its star.If this finding stands up to further observational scrutiny, it represents a major milestone in the field of astronomyKip HodgesFacebookTwitterAnother dip could well be a moon, known as an exomoon outside our solar system.The more powerful and precise Hubble telescope detected a second and smaller decrease in starlight three and a half hours after the planet passed in front of the star, “like a dog following its owner on a leash,” as Mr Kipping put it.The observation period, however, ended before the moon could complete its transit.That is why the astronomers need another look with Hubble, hopefully next spring.Despite the evidence, Mr Teachey stressed “we are urging caution here”.“The first exomoon is obviously an extraordinary claim and it requires extraordinary evidence,” Mr Teachey said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jupiter’s Great Red Spot with the moon Io “Furthermore, the size we’ve calculated for this moon, about the size of Neptune, has hardly been anticipated and so that, too, is reason to be careful here.”He added: “We’re not cracking open Champagne bottles just yet on this one.”If indeed a moon, it would be about two million miles from its planet and appear twice as big in its sky, as the moon does in ours.The astronomers are uncertain how this potential moon might have formed, given its size.“If confirmed, this finding could completely shake up our understanding of how moons are formed and what they can be made of,” Nasa’s science mission chief Thomas Zurbuchen said in a statement.According to the researchers, another compelling piece of evidence in favour of a moon is that the planet passed in front of its star more than an hour earlier than predicted.“This would be the first case of detecting a moon outside our solar system,” said Columbia #astronomer David Kipping. Kipping and @alexteachey have compelling evidence of a candidate exomoon orbiting a planet the size of Jupiter. https:t.co daVPXdpYBw— Columbia UniversityOctober , A moon could cause that kind of an uncertain, wobbly path, they noted.Mr Kipping said that was how the Earth and moon would appear from far away.This particular planet, or exoplanet, is about the same distance from its star as Earth is to the sun.Another planet could cause the same gravitational nudge, the researchers noted, although Kepler observations have come up empty in that regard.Kepler-b is the only planet found so far around this star.For Mr Teachey and Mr Kipping, the best and simplest explanation is that Kepler-b has a moon.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Earth’s own moon rises behind Sean Henry’s sculpture The Couple at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in Northumberland “We’ve tried our best to rule out other possibilities,” Mr Kipping told reporters.“But we were unable to find any other single hypothesis which can explain all of the data we have.”Their findings were published in the journal Science Advances.The journal’s deputy editor, Kip Hodges, praised the researchers for their cautious tone, given the dficult and complicated process of identying an exomoon.“If this finding stands up to further observational scrutiny, it represents a major milestone in the field of astronomy,” Mr Hodges said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Star trails over Kielder Water and Forest Park The Columbia astronomers said they may be able to clinch this as early as next year, with more Hubble viewing.In the meantime, they are encouraging other scientists to join in and embracing the scrutiny that’s sure to come.Whether confirmed or not, the subject offers insight into how rare, or how common, our own solar system might be.Moons are abundant in our own solar system, with close to .Of the eight planets in our solar system, only Mercury and Venus have none.Given that both the planet and its potential moon are gas giants, no one is suggesting conditions that might support le.“But going forward, I think we’re opening the doors to finding worlds like that,” Mr Teachey said."},{"url":null,"title":"us emergency management bosses carry out alert test","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.The challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.A Force  gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some  minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.On arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasnrsquot.The leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.As the leboat made herjourney to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.Theto Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at pm, ing home one hour later.ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.Some of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekendrsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellanrsquos Lower Square for generations.Slieve Croob councillor Roiacutesiacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the townrsquos permanent Christmas tree.ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/16063912.Festival_guests_left_feeling_cheesed_off_call_for_a_refund/resources/images/8768120.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Connel McMullan, pictured at the inquiry, is Fergal Hegartys boss The RHI Inquiry is due to be finished by that stage.Yesterday a lawyer told Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry that it had not even obtained a witness statement from Mr Hegarty.He was first named publicly in relation to the RHI scandal in January  by the News Letter after this newspaper received leaked emails showing that he had disseminated information which he received from civil servants to others in the renewables industry.The emails from mid-summer , the point where the scheme was running out of control, show that the industry had advance warning of looming cost controls – a factor which enabled more people to pile into the uncapped ‘cash for ash’ scheme.Before publishing details of the contact, the News Letter repeatedly sought to contact Mr Hegarty by phone and email, but he did not respond.Yesterday his situation arose in questions to his boss.Connel McMullan, a director of Alternative Heat, yesterday gave evidence to the inquiry.Senior counsel to the inquiry David Scoffield QC put it to him: “A lot of the emails that we’ve seen from your company involve Mr Hegarty some of them involve you.“Mr Hegarty would have been someone that the inquiry was interested in getting evidence from. Our understanding is that he has been out of the country for most of the last year, year and a half, travelling. Is that right ”Mr McMullan said: “Yes, he’s on a sabbatical travelling around the world.”Mr Scoffield asked: “Is he being paid by your company while he’s away ”Tragic Rhonda O’Loughlin was ‘free spirit’, says grieving sister Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr McMullan said that he was not being paid and was “on leave”.Mr Scoffield said: “On the basis that he has been away, we haven’t been able to get evidence from him directly, which is one of the reasons that I’m asking you about some of the emails that he’s sent. Was his sabbatical in any way related to this inquiry or the possibility that he might be asked to give evidence ”Mr McMullan said: “Not in my understanding, no.”When askedhe had discussed that with Mr Hegarty, Mr McMullan said: “Em. It’s not something that I’ve discussed with him, no. Em, he is aware of the inquiry and aware of the media stigma that runs with that but he is also well aware of his position and where we stand as a company so I don’t believe it would have any bearing on any decision he would make on that front.”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin askedMr Hegarty’s expenses were being paid during his absence from Northern Ireland. Mr McMullan said: “No.”He added that his job was being retained and “he is set to[at the] end of this year, start of next year, I believe – that’s where he was hoping to be back so, yeah, he’s a year out basically...”Mr Scoffield said that the inquiry did not even have a written statement from Mr Hegarty, despite attempting to contact him through his company.In one of Mr Hegarty’s emails which the inquiry has compelled his company to release, he referred to “the fact that the poultry industry is exploiting the scheme”. Mr McMullan said that he did not have evidence of the scheme being abused in the poultry industry.Mr McMullan said that his company “did supply every email that we had on the system that was in relation to him”.Mr Scoffield said that it seemed that whatever information was being provided to Mr Hegarty by civil servants was being written down in emails and “sent out quite openly”.Mr McMullan said that Mr Hegary was “very good at his job”.Although his company had received advance notice through Mr Hegarty that RHI was to be made less lucrative in , Mr McMullan said that he had not realised until “early February”  that the scheme was to be shut completely.However, in one of several questions which only Mr Hegarty can answer, the inquiry was told that an email from Mr Hegarty showed that the previous month he was aware that the scheme was likely to be closing and was asking civil servants to send him details of what would be happening.Mr McMullan said he did not know how Mr Hegarty knew that the scheme was likely to be closing and then told the inquiry “I can find out”.Sir Patrick asked him: “How can you find out ”The witness said: “Well I can ask him I can ask Fergal.”Sir Patrick said: “So you’re in touch with him, are you ”Mr McMullan said: “Aye, yeah. He carries his phone and he’s contactable, yeah.”try catch     .               ..

Harry Gibson from Beragh passed away in a tragic accident last month On Tuesday, the -year-old’s family received the devastating news that her body had been located.Her sudden death is the third tragedy to hit the close-knit community of Beragh in recent weeks. Young farmer Harry Gibson died in tragic accident last weekend, while Kyra McKinley from the village was killed in a road crash in August.Rhonda’s sister Yvonne Reid recounted her family’s “living nightmare” during the week her sister had been missing, And while the cause of Rhonda’s death is not yet known, Yvonne said the family is thankful that they can now begin to grieve.   Kyra McKinley from Beragh was killed in a road crash in August “We are not sure at this point what has actually happened,” she told the News Letter.“It appears she has gone out for a walk and fallen. When I last saw her a few days before she disappeared everything was normal. She was joking and having a laugh.“She had been involved in a car accident a few weeks ago. The feeling now is that maybe that is connected in some way maybe she had a knock to the head or something. We just don’t know at this point.”Recalling the traumatic experience of joining in the search for her missing sister, Yvonne said: “There had only been one sighting of Rhonda out walking on the road, and other than that there were no leads whatsoever. “We really struggled to cope with the uncertainty and not knowing what had happened. We searched for days on end, no one went to work during that week. But the support we had from friends was amazing and it has really helped us through this. We also can’t thank the Garda enough for all their efforts.” It is understood Rhonda’s body was discovered by farmers. A post mortem examination is due to be carried out today to determine the cause of her death.Rhonda, the youngest of four siblings, was employed as a community nurse. She moved to Donegal around five years ago to live with her boyfriend.Sinn Fein launches response to Legacy consultation Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Paying tribute to her “baby sister”, Yvonne said: “She was a free spirit.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice.

The four-storey building was sold off this summer, after being marketed by commercial property firm Lambert Smith Hampton.Greg Henry, associate director of agency at Lambert Smith Hampton, told Ulster Business: “We were delighted to complete this deal at the end of July following active interest from owner occupiers and investor developers alike.”Elsewhere, the former First Trust Bank on the Ormeau Road in Belfast could be demolished to make way for a new retail and cafe development. A planning application, made by PWD Developments, is seeking to create a mixed use development, which will incorporate two ground floor units and eight apartments.The proposed scheme would involve the demolition of the two-storey building to make way for the new three-storey project.The building sits across the The Pavilion and Errigle bars, was put on the market last year with a price tag of around £,.The proposed building design has been developed to improve the streetscape, and according to the architects, offers a clean, crisp and modern interpretation of a traditional design.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Leader-web.jpg","title":"leader of the house addresses top  companies gala event","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business The EU should \"come to the table and start taking our Chequers proposals very seriously\" the Leader of the House of Commons has told a top business event in Belfast. The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises.

It would have been an extremely busy department at that time following the financial crisis in  but it provided invaluable experience” he said.And while the workload in that area of the business increased in the months and years following the recession, Michael said an overwhelming majority of the CavanaghKelly core client base were able to successfully trade their way through this tough period.Following a busy three year period he then joined the corporate finance team as a manager, then onto a more senior role, before joining as a partner this year – heading up CavanaghKelly’s advisory offering.A Queen’s University graduate, who studied law and accountancy, Michael is also a licensed insolvency practitioner.“I now lead our advisory offering. We deliver a wide-range of advisory engagements,” Michael said.“This includes mergers and acquisitions, disposals, fundraising, business planning, strategic business development, forensic accounting and debt advisory.”And in the last  months, the firm has advised on over  MA deals, with a transactional value of around £m. “Our track record in adding value to businesses and transactions across Northern Ireland can be evidenced by the growth across our own practice the last few years which has largely developed from word of mouth referrals from current clients” he said.“Our advisory pipeline of engagements remains strong whilst our audit and accounts ision is achieving year-on-year growth. We’re very pleased with the impact and effort of management team and staff across the practice”.And what does the practice offer its clients that sets them apart from the others  Michael says it’s the ability to provide quality specialist advice at a competitive fee level which includes regular direct contact with partners and senior management across the practice. “We emphasise getting to know our clients so we’re best placed to guide and support. It’s important to know what drives them, their aspirations, their ethos. We want to build long-term relationships so we can understand their business and identy opportunities.”“We focus on making a real dference to our clients, to assist them to grow and flourish.”The practice operates across all sectors but, has a particularly strong presence in retail, agri-food, construction, manufacturing and engineering.And while there remain signicant challenges for Northern Ireland businesses, with political instability and Brexit around the corner, Michael says CavanaghKelly is well-placed to deal with the challenges of cross-border business.“We have clients which operate out of the south, and we have a number of chartered tax advisors who are qualied in the Republic of Ireland – so we are well positioned to deal with the challenges of Brexit.”Despite the above concerns, there remains positive activity in the marketplace. “We’re finding that deal and banking transactional activity is still reasonably strong, despite Brexit and the issues at Stormont,” Michael said.“In relation to the current funding environment, there is definitely appetite for investment in Northern Ireland. There has been an expansion in funding providers in the market in recent times meaning there is now good availability of capital across most sectors, and this represents a strong opportunity for businesses.“We’ve developed close relationships with these investors and funders and regularly act for our clients in identying opportunities whether it be through investment, expansion or sale”.ABOUT CAVANAGHKELLYAs one of Northern Ireland’s leading independent accountancy and business advisory practices, CavanaghKelly was formed in  when Sean Cavanagh and Des Kelly merged their inidual businesses.“The marriage was a good example of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts,” Sean Cavanagh, chairman of the practice, says.For CavanaghKelly, it’s the people which make the business a success. It currently employs more than  staff across its offices – which includes Omagh, Dungannon and Enniskillen – with business split across audit and accounts, tax and advisory.“We are a training practice as well, and we invest heavily in our employees. It’s about investing in people, and focusing on their growth, and health and well-being.”CavanaghKelly’s key values remain central to its culture: commitment to the quality of advice and dedicated services to clients. They work to ensure that all employees love what they do and to create an environment in which they can excel.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
