You truly do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface at Halloween or a black person who puts on white face,\u0027 stated Kelly during a roundtable discussion on Halloween costumes last Tuesday.\u0027That was okay when I was a kid, as long as you were dressing like a character.\u0027She then pointed to de Lesseps darkening her features while dressing as Diana Ross.\u0027I don\u0027t see how that is racist on Halloween,\u0027 said Kelly.  \u0027We didn\u0027t want her to leave Fox News\u0027: Lachlan Murdoch says...\u0027Just don\u0027t color your face\u0027: Al Roker takes a dig at Megyn...Heather Locklear facing new legal woes as EMT she \u0027attacked\u0027...EXCLUSIVE - ‘It’s all out war’: Megyn Kelly is looking to...Share this articleIn response to Kelly defending de Lesseps, her panel guest Jacob Soboroff said: \u0027I haven\u0027t seen it, but it sounds pretty racist to me.\u0027Jenna Bush hager then chimed in, adding: \u0027Me too.\u0027Kelly then said: \u0027I can\u0027t keep up with the number of people we\u0027re offending just by being normal people these days.\u0027De Lesseps has not appeared to suffer any fallout from Kelly\u0027s comments, but Roker and Melvin were both very vocal about the impact her words had on them and why they were so hurtful. \u0027The fact is, while she apologized to the staff, she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country because this is our history, going back to the 1830s,\u0027 said Roker.\u0027Minstrel shows meant to denigrate a race, you know I am old enough to have lived through Amos \u0026amp Andy where you had white people in blackface playing the black characters just magnifying the worst stereotypes about black people.\u0027Then, in a pointed barb at Kelly\u0027s nonchalant comment about why people were so offended by the practice, he stated: \u0027And that\u0027s what the big problem is.\u0027Craig Melvin went a step further, adding: \u0027There was some criticism online that this was political correctness run amok, and that\u0027s silly and its disingenuous and its just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself.\u0027He then went on to say that while Kelly was a friend, her comment was \u0027indefensible.\u0027          Farewell: \u0027NBC staff is shocked that she would reach out to Luann, but say nothing to any of the people she actually offended with her comment,\u0027 explains the source (Kelly above last Wednesday on her final episode oif Today)          Girl code: De Lesseps (above in August on Kelly\u0027s show) has suffered no real fallout from Kelly\u0027s comments but both Al Roker and Craig Melvin were vocal in expressing why her comments were hurtfulDailyMail.com spoke to a number of NBC employees last week whose feelings on the subject ran the gamut from \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 to outright \u0027appalled\u0027 at Kelly\u0027s behavior and reports that she might claim her coverage of the #MeToo movement played a role in her termination. \u0027How dare she? Who the hell does she think she is?\u0027 said one NBC employee\u0027Her blackface comments were bad but falsely playing the #MeToo card is the worst form of white privilege I have ever seen.\u0027And another employee remarked: \u0027She had no respect for the African American staff on her team and her apology was both fake and dismissive.\u0027An insider at the network told DailyMail.com that after a meeting with Kelly and her staff on Wednesday, a number of employees of color on the show voiced their frustration and anger with the host to human resources.\u0027Lots of people were willing to give her a clean slate after the whole white Santa thing, but she showed her true colors this week,\u0027 said the insider.That insider also noted that what Kelly was doing was not only an affront to her black colleagues, but also the men and women of the #MeToo movement. \u0027If she truly had remorse and felt like she was wrong she should take no money and go into hiding. But she’s greedy and entitled,\u0027 noted the first NBC employee who spoke to DailyMail.com.\u0027What the hell does she have to fight for? She’s been fired for being racist on national television.

John Cannan, a serial rapist and killer, was given the nickname \u0027Kipper\u0027 by bail hostel friends because he liked eating smelly fish and slept much of the day. Mr Kipper was the name of the man who met Suzy when she vanished.2. He resembled a photofit of a man seen with Suzy when she disappeared 32 years ago.3. Detectives learned that Cannan may have been the the \u0027mystery man\u0027 Suzy had a fling with.4.  Suzy had complained of being pestered by a man from Bristol, Cannan\u0027s home city.5. The former car salesman also had access to a BMW of the type thought to have been driven by \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027 to the estate agent appointment.6. Three days before Suzy vanished Cannan was given day release after serving five years for rape. He also had a false alibi.7. One witness suggested he was a stalker seen staring into Suzy\u0027s Fulham estate agent\u0027s window.8. Another person claims he may have seen the convicted killer take her to a park for Champagne.9. A taxi driver claimed the same day, in that area, a man clutching a Champagne bottle and estate agent papers hailed him.10  Former girlfriend Gilly Paige claims her ex had joked he was \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027.

I still have admissions to make but to what end? To speak out would have wholesale repercussions\u0027.His coat was also blood-splattered, but he blamed an abscess in a letter entitled: \u0027The blood on my mac\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There are several truthful reasons how mud and blood came to be on my mac\u0027. The home\u0027s current owner Phillip Carey said police were preparing to dig up the patio 15 years ago but never did after taking samples from the stone slabs.He said: \u0027They had looked at the patio in 2003 and it was discounted at that moment, it\u0027s directly outside the backdoor.\u0027They traced when the patio stones were bought, who they were bought from and this is ten years afterwards.\u0027 Retired Det Supt Jim Dickie, who led the inquiry for six years, said yesterday: \u0027We didn\u0027t dig up the garden because we didn\u0027t have any specific information she may be buried there.\u0027   Police have covered much of the garden in tents and tarpaulin as they dig for Suzy\u0027s remainsJohn Cannan, 64, will not give up his secrets until the death of his mother, a close relative has said.

Critics can\u0027t help but notice that Robin Wright\u0027s stellar solo-lead performance (right) still can\u0027t help the show from escaping the dank shadow of Kevin SpaceyAt the moment, the sixth season has scored 81 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and has average rating of just 63.7 per cent. The general consensus amongst viewers is that the show spends too much time addressing what happened to Frank and the ramifications of his absence. IndieWire said that the focus on Frank fallout \u0027undercuts\u0027 the numerous \u0027women-first stories,\u0027 causing the season to appear \u0027stagnant.\u0027The sentiment was shared by Variety who stated that Frank\u0027s absence left the season \u0027scrambling\u0027 when it came to to a plot. But almost all viewers have been praising the additions of Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear - who play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedly. Other stellar performances are also consistently referenced, including Patricia Clarkson.Before you binge watch House of Cards\u0027 sixth season, here is what you need to know!House of Cards reviews IndieWire  \u0027More than half the final season passes before “House of Cards” feels like Claire Underwood’s (Robin Wright) story instead of his epilogue, and even when she starts to see her vision borne out, the lingering questions are all about Frank,\u0027 the review stated. \u0027Despite the hype, Season 6 isn’t Claire’s show. It’s still Frank’s, which undercuts the season’s many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.\u0027 They added that the show started to feel a lot like a \u0027murder-mystery\u0027 - but not exactly in a good way.  \u0027Seeing it this way provides a bit of goofy levity to a series always toeing the line between pompous prestige and soapy melodrama, even if the story’s morbid obsession with how Frank died sparks bad memories of “This Is Us,” Jack Pearson, and a slow-cooker. The review did praise the performance of Patricia Clarkson as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade Jane Davis.           The cast at the season six premiere on October 22 It said: \u0027 After joining the cast in Season 5, the Oscar nominee  operates on another level than the rest of the cast — another show, even.\u0027About the show\u0027s shortcomings, Indiewire said: \u0027When Claire addressed the camera and said, “My turn” and all but erased her camera-whore hubby from control, there was no reason the audience should believe otherwise. \u0027Instead, five of the eight final episodes over-emphasize his importance and fail to create arcs worthy of Wright’s talents or Claire’s iniduality. Worse yet, they weaken the show’s conscious effort to highlight the discrimination facing female politicians.\u0027  IndieWire gave the season a C Plus grade.Entertainment Weekly  Entertainment Weekly rated the season much higher, at a B Plus, and praised the direction the series went with women in politics.  \u0027In its final season, House of Cards wants to imagine a scenario where women are the ones who rule the world — but instead of making it a better place, they are as cutthroat, venal, and wholly nihilistic as the legions of men who have come before,\u0027 they said.EW also relished in the opportunities \u0027actresses in their midlife prime\u0027 had at commanding their scenes throughout the show.  Their highest praise was saved for Wright, where they said: (about Claire) The final season of House of Cards belongs to her, and more importantly, Wright herself. \u0027Sporting perfectly-tailored, military-style suits and dresses, her sleek blonde bob shielding her head like a helmet, Wright brings more humor to Claire than ever before as the President exploits sexist stereotypes about female hysteria\u0027As the sly nods to Lysistrata and Sylvia Plath’s Lady Lazarus attest, behind President Underwood’s feminist facade is a warrior set on nothing less than complete patriarchal destruction.\u0027 NPRNPR seemed the most pessimistic about the direction that the show went in its sixth season, claiming that the first five episodes \u0027reveal just how tiresome the show\u0027s machinations have become.\u0027They were quick to praise the performance of the supporting cast in the absence of Casey.\u0027The performances here are wonderful, especially Kinnear as controlling power broker Bill Shepherd and Lane as Annette Shepherd — whose rivalry with Claire is tangible and toxic,\u0027 the review stated.          Diane Lane is playing Annette Shepherd (right). She and Claire Underwood are longtime frenemies in the showTheir review did blast real world implications especially the workings of the Trump Administration and the timing of the show\u0027s release.\u0027Scheduled to drop Nov. 2, days before a hotly contested midterm election, this show features an array of Washington power brokers working to disguise their shady machinations from the public eye,\u0027 the review said. \u0027In real life, however, the dysfunction of the Trump White House seems an open book, with new scandals erupting in the press or from the campaign trail every day.\u0027 NPR added: \u0027Partisanship fuels everything in real-life politics, which has always made House of Cards feel a bit like a dark fantasy where America\u0027s biggest problems are unscrupulous politicians of every stripe — not the tribalism and propagandizing that destroys consensus on the most basic facts across party lines.\u0027 UproxxUproxx touted the show as being \u0027definitely better\u0027 and added that giving Claire \u0027more power and more responsibility is a step in the right direction.\u0027 But then listed a series of critiques on various elements of the plot and production.The review stated: \u0027A lot of the same general problems are lingering about. The show still takes itself entirely too seriously for something as pulpy and crazy as it is on paper.\u0027Share this articleThey also wrote that that plot was \u0027too much.\u0027  \u0027House of Cards is off to a much better start this season, thanks in large part to the notable subtraction and subsequent elevation of its stars, but it is still very much House of Cards, different in good ways but still the same in the bad ones,\u0027 Uproxx added.           Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear (right) play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedlyThe AtlanticThe Atlantic also praised performances while blasting the plot. They said: \u0027Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering.\u0027In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implications.Unfortunately, it isn’t until more than halfway through the eight-episode season that Claire’s big plan becomes clear. When it does, it involves Wright making a hammy, malevolent parody of gendered expectations, brilliantly puncturing the gunmetal patina that’s fallen upon the show and helping bury the memory of Frank’s excesses. The plot surely must hurl toward doom, but a deeper tragedy is suggested: if only this woman never had to hide her true self.          In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implicationsVariety Variety felt that Robin Wright\u0027s Claire was truly coming into her own in the show\u0027s sixth season, adding that \u0027the spotlight suits her.\u0027 \u0027The clever thing “House of Cards” does early in its sixth season is not to cover for Frank Underwood’s absence but to use it to emphasize the fundamental isolation in Claire’s character,\u0027 the review read. \u0027The chilly desire to alienate others so that, human contact having been taken out of the equation, things can get accomplished.\u0027 But Variety did chime in with the feeling that the show wasn\u0027t able to pull away from Frank and Spacey\u0027s \u0027gravitational pull.\u0027  The review added:  \u0027The show, one that’s wildly changed narrative course many times even without pragmatic real-world reasons at stake, seems surprisingly confused about how to reboot. \u0027In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, “House of Cards” is a ride when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge. This drama, on which we’ve learned anything can happen, should be far less bound to its own past.\u0027  House of Cards\u0027 sixth season premiered on Friday on Netflix. House of Cards: Season 6 - Rotten Tomatoes‘House of Cards’ Review: Season 6 Keeps Kevin Spacey Alive, Frank Dead | IndieWire‘House of Cards’ Season 6 Review: Robin Wright Soars in Netflix Drama – VarietyHouse of Cards Season 6 Review: Claire Triumphs, Coldly - The Atlantic"},{"url":null,"title":"Vegetarians miserable enjoy parties meat eaters scientists claim","story":"    A study has found vegetarians have lower self-esteem and see less meaning in life (stock image)Vegetarians may be healthier than meat-eaters – but they are also more miserable, say researchers.Those who cut meat from their diet experience more negative feelings, have lower self-esteem and see less meaning in life, a study found.The authors conclude that vegetarians may be less ‘psychologically well-adjusted’, suggesting teasing by omnivores may be to blame.It comes after food critic William Sitwell quit as editor of Waitrose Food magazine after making a joke about killing vegans.Researchers asked 400 vegetarians, meat-eaters and ‘semi-vegetarians’ to record their feelings over a fortnight. Of the three groups, vegetarians experienced the most negative feelings and enjoyed social occasions least.Lead author Dr John Nezlek, from the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poznan, Poland, said: ‘Sometimes unwittingly, and sometimes intentionally, vegetarians may be excluded from social events or made to feel odd or different because they are vegetarians.

Tuno will be available in cans, and in pouches in flavours ranging from sweet chilli to sesame ginger.Eric Woods, managing director of Worldwide Food Associates, which is distributing the product, said it was ‘a tasty, healthy and convenient option’ which would transform the meat-free food market.Similar questions – asking how well their day had gone and how optimistic they were about the future – were used to assess depressive tendencies.Vegetarians scored 4.62 for self-respect and meat-eaters 5.33, where a lower score was worse. They were also more likely to be depressed and unsatisfied with their life, the study found.The authors, also from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, suggested vegetarians may suffer because they are seen by meat-eaters as morally superior.They added: ‘Given that many celebrities advocate some type of vegetarian diet, non-vegetarians may feel that vegetarians are “putting on airs” and that they are “too good” for non-vegetarians.’Twenty-four vegetarians, including some vegans, took part in the study. They were compared with 323 omnivores and 56 ‘semi-vegetarians’, some of whom ate fish or only avoided red meat.When asked whether they felt they led a purposeful existence, vegetarians saw less meaning in life than the other groups, according to researchers. They were also more likely to experience stress and embarrassment.However, a spokesman for the Vegetarian Society disputed the findings, saying: ‘What we see when people adopt a veggie diet in line with their values is they feel excited and positive about the contribution they are making.’The study appears in the journal Ecology of Food and Nutrition.

She is, after all, very annoying. And she’s always flogging some right-on-trend miracle remedy to life’s travails. Some of them, as doctors have pointed out, are deeply dubious, little more than quackery.But to me, Gwynnie is the Donald Trump of womankind — maddening, preposterous, in your face . . . but quite often right.Despite her cringe-making announcement about her ‘conscious uncoupling’ from first husband Chris Martin, for example, their separation turned out to be one of the most amicable orces in showbusiness.Likewise, Gwynnie’s comments on her change of life are par for the course — intensely irritating and with a touch of her usual gobbledegook. ‘Menopause gets a really bad rap and needs rebranding,’ she says, before stressing that what society needs today is great examples of ‘aspirational menopausal women’.          Likewise, Gwynnie’s comments on her change of life are par for the course — intensely irritating and with a touch of her usual gobbledegookBut again, isn’t there some truth to what she says? Mention the menopause ten years ago — particularly in a career environment — and you’d have people reaching for the smelling salts.Yet 57 per cent of women suffer from its symptoms according to the NHS — and of those, 22 per cent say they can’t cope without medication.On the other hand, we have to keep things in perspective. For the majority of women it is not a torment, it’s just irritating.I’m one of the 87 per cent who did not suffer an emotional or physical breakdown as a result of it. We’re not all consumed by anger and hot flushes, but we should all feel compassion for those who are.Above all, modern women want to get on with our lives however it affects us. Which is why Gwynnie’s call for ‘menopausal, aspirational’ role models is not quite as daft as it sounds.   Eva so, er, comfyWhen Eva Herzigova first caused car crashes with her Hello Boys!

As the air is warmed up by people and equipment inside the building, it will get warmer and then rise through the building to vent out at the top floor above the ground, creating a natural air circulation.On the other hand, some of the rock face is exposed in the interior of the building, providing an ideal thermal mass to help regulate the building\u0027s temperature.The InterContinental Hotels Group is yet to release any pictures of InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland.However, guests can now book for stays at the hotel from November 15 and onwards on Chinese travel site Alitrip. On the website, prices of the rooms range from 1,488 yuan (£168) to 2,888 yuan (£326) per night.On the official booking app of InterContinental Hotels Group, rooms can be booked from December 1 and onwards at a starting nightly price of 3,325 yuan (£371)."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/26/14/4B93861200000578-0-image-m-5_1524749902396.jpg","title":"Jane Fonda Amy Schumer stars appear U S voter telethon","story":"Hanoi Jane takes on Trump: Jane Fonda is among dozens of Hollywood liberals who will urge young people to vote against the president\u0027s agenda in Tuesday\u0027s midterm elections  Also in the line-up: Liberals Amy Schumer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chelsea Handler are all taking part in Monday\u0027s telethonMore than 50 actors, comedians and YouTube stars will take part, including Judd Apatow, Chelsea Handler and Olga Kay.

Pictured is a map of Britain with a selection of the sites           Among the sites was Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare testing was carried out. Scientists studied the effects of anthrax by putting the bacteria in bombs and detonating them near a herd of sheep on the island, which slowly killed them. The island was subsequently put off limits to humans until the late 20th Century, when it was decontaminated          An underground bunker called The Paddock, pictured, was built 40ft under a post office in Dollis Hill, north London, and intended to be a back-up should the War Rooms beneath Whitehall be damaged in a Luftwaffe bombing raid. The bunker was bombproof and big enough to house the War Cabinet and 200 staff, but Churchill only ever held one meeting there and is said to have disliked it because it was \u0027damp\u0027 and too far from the city. The land above has since been used for social housing but the bunker still exists and generators and boilers remain inside          Madresfield Court in Worcestershire, pictured, was picked out as a safe house for the Royal Family should they need to be evacuated. If the Battle of Britain had been lost and the Germans had successfully invaded, King George VI and his family would have been moved to the country house because it is secluded in woodland and was far enough away from the sea to mount a strong defence. It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire, with other stately homes picked to host Churchill and government officials. A house has been on this spot since the 1400s and has been owned by the Lygon family. It is currently home to Rosalind, Lady MorrisonThey include Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare tests were carried out by scientists who infected sheep with anthrax.It left the island dangerous to mammals for decades, until it was finally decontaminated in the late 20th Century. Another site was The Paddock in Dollis Hill, north London, an alternative bunker for Prime Minister Winston Churchill, designed to be completely bombproof in case the Whitehall War Rooms were damaged by Luftwaffe bombing raids.REVEALED: Truth behind Netflix drama of Adolf Eichmann\u0027s...\u0027You could feel the machine gun bullets flying past you\u0027:...Faces of brave soldiers who died in the First World War,...Share this articleThe £250,000 shelter, constructed 40ft beneath the post office building in Brook Road, was meant to be a last resort for the prime minister should the Battle of Britain have been lost, and was large enough to house the war cabinet and up to 200 staff.  The cabinet met there twice, in October 1940 and March 1941, but the bunker, which could only be accessed by a concealed door in the post office, was abandoned before the end of the war.Since then, it has been left almost untouched and today all that is left inside it are generators, boilers and the remains of the telephone circuitry which connected it to the rest of Britain\u0027s war-time command infrastructure.          At the outbreak of the war the government became concerned over potential damage to valuable works of art and national treasures from bombing raids or an invasion. After searching for a secret location to store them, officials picked out Manod Quarry in North Wales, pictured, because it was isolated and deep enough to be bomb proof. Underground chambers were then renovated to make them hospitable for the artwork, with air conditioning installed to control the environment and stop them becoming affected by damp          Road and rail access to Manod, pictured, was improved to allow trucks to bring lorry loads of paintings to the quarry. Specially-designed wagons were also built to allow the artworks to be safely transported through the caverns without being damaged. Although the masterpieces were removed when peace returned, the Department of the Environment was unwilling to vacate the site and only left in the 1980s. Speculation mounted over what had been kept there, but when it was reopened all that was found was shelving and old packaging     Clapham South Tube Station was converted into one of eight deep-level shelters built around London to protect the public during Luftwaffe raids. Visitors had to walk down 180 steps to reach the shelter. Other locations included Chancery Lane station on the Central line and Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Stockwell, Clapham North and Clapham Common on the Northern Line. In 1948, the deep shelter at Clapham was used as temporary accommodation for immigrants from the West IndiesMeanwhile Madresfield Court, a country house in Worcestershire, was picked out as a potential safehouse for the Royal Family in the event of a successful German invasion.Should the Germany Army have made it to London, the Royals, including then Princess Elizabeth, would have fled to the mansion, which is secluded among woodland.It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire if London became \u0027untenable\u0027 during the war, with more stately homes picked to house Churchill and other government officials. Another  forgotten site is the abandoned Rhydymwyn Valley Works in north Wales where Britain\u0027s World War Two chemical weapons were stored but never used.The site is now a nature reserve but the entrance to the tunnels is still visible with the warning sign \u0027entry to tunnels is dangerous\u0027.Many country houses were requisitioned by the Government to house royalty, politicians and, in some cases, high profile German POWs.      Although it may look like an attractive country manor, Mytchett Place in Surrey, pictured, actually served as a makeshift prison for Hitler\u0027s deputy Rudolf Hess a month after he was captured in Scotland after parachuting into Britain in an attempted peace mission. After initially being detained in the Tower of London, Hess was moved to Mytchett Place in June 1941 and spent 13 months there, even attempting suicide shortly after arriving by throwing himself off a balcony          Hess, pictured centre at the Nuremberg Trials with Hermann Goering, left, and Joachim von Ribbentrop, right, was eventually moved to a hospital in Wales in 1942, where he spent the remainder of the war. After Germany surrendered, Hess, who had been stripped of all titles by Hitler after his unauthorised peace mission, was found guilty of \u0027crimes against peace\u0027 but not war crimes, and was handed a life sentence at Spandau Prison in Berlin          Another quarry to be requisitioned by the British government was Rhydymwyn in Flintshire, Wales, pictured. Neville Chamberlain\u0027s government identified the site as a good location to store chemical weapons should they ever need to be used against Nazi Germany over fears Hitler might attack with mustard gas. Tunnels were then fortified within the quarry in 1939 and by 1943 there were more than 2,000 workers on site          The quarry, pictured from the outside, was later identified as a potential place to store Bank of England gold should Britain be attacked by nuclear weapons. The mustard gas remained stored on site until the late 1950s until it was safely disposed of. The tunnels have been out of use since the early 1990s but were briefly opened to the public for guided tours earlier this yearRudolf Hess, the Deputy Fuhrer of Nazi Germany, was held captive at Mytchett Place, in Mytchett, Surrey, which is now the home of a research company.Hess was transported from the Tower of London to Mytchett Place, known as \u0027Camp Z\u0027, on May 20, 1941.He spent 13 months there and once attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself off a balcony on June 15, 1941.Target maps for the famous Dambusters raid were produced at Hughenden Manor, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and a country house near Lochaber in northern Scotland was taken over for Special Operations Executive training.Quarries in north Wales were used by the National Gallery to hide priceless treasures which were under threat during the Blitz, and tunnels across the country were converted into air raid shelters.In addition, farmers\u0027 fields became dummy and decoy airfields and cities.During the Second World War, thousands of sites across Britain were requisitioned to support the war effort.Command and control centres were generally the best protected and many were indeed bunkers buried beneath ground.    Although its occupants were not as high-profile as some other stately homes, Hughenden Manor in High Wycombe still played a vital role in the war effort. The country house, which once belonged to prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, was used as a intelligence base and codenamed Hillside. RAF and Air Ministry staff produced detailed maps and photos of Germany for raids, including drawing up the plans for the famous Dambusters mission. The house is now owned by the National Trust and is open to the public          Between 1939 and 1946 a secret factory operated at Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome, pictured, which is now Leeds Bradford Airport. It was the largest single factory in Europe and run by aircraft firm Avro and because of the danger from bombing, it was camouflaged as farmland, with grass covering the roof and fake farm buildings erected around the factory, with even a duck pond built. At the height of its operation, more than 17,500 people worked on site 24-hours a day, and it produced almost 700 Lancaster bombers as well as thousands more of other types of aircraft           Arisaig House in the Scottish Highlands, pictured, became the base for the Special Operations Executive during the war, which was Britain\u0027s secret service during the conflict, running sabotage and spying missions behind enemy lines. Arisaig was used for paramilitary training missions in rough terrain  to prepare agents for similar conditions in mainland Europe. Foreign nationals were also trained at the site, and a memorial was unveiled there to Czech and Slovak soldiers in 2009          Ditchley House, pictured, in Oxfordshire, was picked as the alternative residence for Churchill over concerns his homes at Chartwell and Chequers were \u0027too visible\u0027 to German aircraft. Ditchley was considered ideal because of heavy foliage around the building and an obscured access road. Churchill frequently visited the property and even negotiated deals with the US there. He returned to Chequers in 1943 after security improvements were made. It is n ow owned by the Ditchley Foundation trust and was used for filming in Downton AbbeyHowever, the country\u0027s industrial powerhouses were simply too numerous and required too much space to be concealed in this way.The authorities did their best to protect these above ground sites as best it could, through a mixture of camouflage, guards and decoy and dummy sites to confuse bombers.The general public did their bit to keep them secret by adhering to the \u0027careless talk costs lives\u0027 campaign.Mr Philpott, 61, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said: \u0027Britain\u0027s secret wartime locations have themselves enjoyed a variety of fates.\u0027Some of course have been recognised, often only recently, for their historical significance and have been memorialised and made into museums and visitor attractions, like Bletchley and the Churchill War Rooms.\u0027Others have reverted to their pre-war use, including many of the country houses, sports stadia and other locations requisitioned in 1939.\u0027Some gained new uses in the post-war world, often associated with the Cold War, like the shadow factories built for war which were put to peaceful use, making cars or tractors or other products.\u0027Many though have disappeared altogether. The radar stations that dotted the wartime coastline, the decoy and dummy airfields, the hideouts of the British Resistance have to all intents and purposes vanished.\u0027A few have been frozen in aspic, left pretty much as they were in 1945, not memorialised but also not converted for other uses.\u0027It is perhaps these places, like the abandoned chemical factory in north Wales and the alternative war rooms in north London which for me are the most poignant traces of secret wartime Britain.\u0027Secret Wartime Britain, by Colin Philpott, will be published by Pen \u0026amp Sword on November 30 and costs £25. "},{"url":null,"title":"Snake appears Israels Western Wall sparking claims Biblical prophecy coming true","story":"Hebrew bloggers have claimed the appearance of a snake at the Western Wall proves we are in \u0027dangerous times\u0027 predating the coming of the Messiah\u0027The evil inclination, personified by the snake in Eden, will make a resurgence in the days before Messiah,\u0027 the bloggers were quoted as saying by Breaking Israel News.Several references to the Messiah saving an afflicted or endangered people are made in the Old Testament. Hebrew-language site pointed out that in Jewish teachings, Israel is sometimes compared to a pigeon or dove.Police launch investigation into anti-Semitism in the Labour...Battle-scarred bible shows the bullet marks it took when it...Share this articleThe site said: \u0027Just as the pigeon is safe so long as it seeks shelter among the stones of the Temple Mount, the Jews are protected by the Torah commandments. \u0027When the pigeon comes out from the stones or the the Jews move away from the Torah, they are in danger.\u0027We are truly in the dangerous times that directly precede Mashiach (Messiah).\u0027           The snake (centre) was seen scaring away a pigeon perched on the wall, which bloggers said represented the state of Israel being plagued by danger  A worker then climbed a ladder to remove the snake, sparking discussion about what the symbol could mean onlineIt comes after several other incidents at the Temple Mount which have been interpreted as religious signs. Four months ago a large piece of stone fell from the Western Wall, almost crushing a woman who had gone there to pray.One kabbalist - or mystic - interpreted it as a sign that the Third Temple should be built, because the stone fell the morning after Tisha B’Av, which is a fast to commemorate the destruction of the first two temples.The construction of the Third Temple is supposed to predict the Messiah\u0027s coming.Shortly afterward, a large cloud of dust billowed up from inside the Temple Mount Compound, surrounding the Dome of the rock for several minutes.One rabbi suggested the dust revealed a conflict taking place on the spiritual plane. Watch!

I thought there must be a problem and wentback to the site office. \u0027A Persimmon agent came back with me and in the end, he had to shoulder-barge the door to get it open.\u0027     Mr Harris said his neighbours have been laughing at the \u0027wonky\u0027 brickwork at the side of the property, pictured          He also said there were problems with the drainage, pictured, causing waste water to pool          Mr Harris said the workmanship was \u0027shoddy\u0027 and the lawn, pictured, is \u0027bumpy\u0027Mr Harris added: \u0027Everything is appallingly built - the workmanship is just shoddy. The problems are unbelievable.\u0027Mr Harris, who lives in Sutton Coldfield in the Midlands, bought the house at Martello Park, Pembroke before building was completed.Together with his wife, who is an area manager for Greggs, he has a number of buy-to-let properties in Pembrokeshire and had planned to rent out the house once it was finished.He added: \u0027When we went to see the development initially, we looked round the show home.Ex-university lecturer, 56, and her husband are arrested for...Inside £25,000 cannabis farm police found at acid attacker...Share this article\u0027It looked like a nice spot, with views onto Pembroke Castle, so we put a deposit down in February 2018.\u0027 \u0027As well as the poor brickwork, we have found paving slabs have been laid straight onto rubble and earth, without any cement.\u0027The ground isn\u0027t level in the garden, the drain covers are sticking out of the ground, and the drains are positioned in the wrong place so the water runs straight past them.\u0027While I was there, I saw a worker laying some slabs and I could see he was doing it all wrong.          The civil engineer added he broke a toe while mowing the lawn and accidentally kicking the exposed drain cover, pictured          Mr Harris said he could tell from experience that builders were \u0027doing it wrong\u0027 and also highlighted issues with pipes and guttering\u0027I\u0027m a bricklayer by trade, so it was clear to me there were no footings under the paving.\u0027Even the guttering is all wrong, and not just on my property. None of the guttering reaches the end of the houses and water cascades down the sides when it rains.\u0027While I was mowing the lawn, I kicked my foot on the raised drain cover and actually broke my toe, causing me to take three weeks off work.\u0027He added his marriage was even tested by the work due to the stress levels. Mr Harris said: \u0027It\u0027s caused my wife and I no end of worry and stress. She has been in tears. If my marriage wasn\u0027t so strong this could have finished us.\u0027Mr Harris highlighted the problems on Facebook and said he was then directed to Persimmon\u0027s social media page. He said: \u0027After I posted my story, I was contacted by Persimmon who said they would like to address my complaints. \u0027They sent a young guy round - he could only have been 20 years old. He spent half a day taking doors on and off, and making it worse.\u0027While Persimmon agreed to rectify some of the issues, the problems persisted and Mr Harris started fixing the problems himself. He drove the 440-mile round trip between the Midlands and Pembrokeshire throughout the summer, staying on a mattress in the back room of the property.          Persimmon say they are trying to work with Mr Harris to find a \u0027satisfactory conclusion\u0027          Mr Harris said he had spent thousands to fix the problems and is taking Persimmon to the small claims courtAfter spending thousands of his own money to fix the problems, Mr Harris has launched legal action.He said: \u0027I have been on to head office. I have been brave enough to take them on and take them to the small claims court.\u0027The rectification work they attempted was not acceptable. I have given them the opportunity to put it right.\u0027I have had to put off getting my tenants in, which has resulted in losses of £1,600.\u0027We have been forced to get on with the retrospective work ourselves and it has cost us thousands.

John Cannan, a serial rapist and killer, was given the nickname \u0027Kipper\u0027 by bail hostel friends because he liked eating smelly fish and slept much of the day. Mr Kipper was the name of the man who met Suzy when she vanished.2. He resembled a photofit of a man seen with Suzy when she disappeared 32 years ago.3. Detectives learned that Cannan may have been the the \u0027mystery man\u0027 Suzy had a fling with.4.  Suzy had complained of being pestered by a man from Bristol, Cannan\u0027s home city.5. The former car salesman also had access to a BMW of the type thought to have been driven by \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027 to the estate agent appointment.6. Three days before Suzy vanished Cannan was given day release after serving five years for rape. He also had a false alibi.7. One witness suggested he was a stalker seen staring into Suzy\u0027s Fulham estate agent\u0027s window.8. Another person claims he may have seen the convicted killer take her to a park for Champagne.9. A taxi driver claimed the same day, in that area, a man clutching a Champagne bottle and estate agent papers hailed him.10  Former girlfriend Gilly Paige claims her ex had joked he was \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027.                                                    After his arrest his former international ice skater girlfriend Gilly Paige told police Cannan had told her he knew where Suzy was buried but it was not been followed up.She had been seduced by the \u0027absolutely gorgeous\u0027 killer after meeting him in a Bristol hotel in May 1987 - ten months after Suzy vanished - after she returned from travelling in south-east Asia.Cannan drove her from Bristol to Birmingham where she lived and appeared to give vital evidence about the murder - but she was confused because she had not heard of the case.Ms Paige said: \u0027I\u0027d been out of the country so long, in Thailand, I had not heard or read anything about it.\u0027The reason he didn\u0027t spook me out was because I thought she\u0027d already been found and John was talking about a topic of interest\u0027.  Police are continuing to dig up the patio at Sheila Cannan\u0027s former home in the West Midlands today.But questions remain over its timing because it appears police knew their prime suspect had worked on the patio - because he admitted it himself 16 years ago. The extraordinary confession emerged in letters sent to a penpal from his cell where he is serving 35 years for abducting and beating to death Shirley Banks in 1987.He said: \u0027I haven\u0027t even told you all I should have done. I still have admissions to make but to what end? To speak out would have wholesale repercussions\u0027.His coat was also blood-splattered, but he blamed an abscess in a letter entitled: \u0027The blood on my mac\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There are several truthful reasons how mud and blood came to be on my mac\u0027. The home\u0027s current owner Phillip Carey said police were preparing to dig up the patio 15 years ago but never did after taking samples from the stone slabs.He said: \u0027They had looked at the patio in 2003 and it was discounted at that moment, it\u0027s directly outside the backdoor.\u0027They traced when the patio stones were bought, who they were bought from and this is ten years afterwards.\u0027 Retired Det Supt Jim Dickie, who led the inquiry for six years, said yesterday: \u0027We didn\u0027t dig up the garden because we didn\u0027t have any specific information she may be buried there.\u0027   Police have covered much of the garden in tents and tarpaulin as they dig for Suzy\u0027s remainsJohn Cannan, 64, will not give up his secrets until the death of his mother, a close relative has said.

Critics can\u0027t help but notice that Robin Wright\u0027s stellar solo-lead performance (right) still can\u0027t help the show from escaping the dank shadow of Kevin SpaceyAt the moment, the sixth season has scored 81 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes and has average rating of just 63.7 per cent. The general consensus amongst viewers is that the show spends too much time addressing what happened to Frank and the ramifications of his absence. IndieWire said that the focus on Frank fallout \u0027undercuts\u0027 the numerous \u0027women-first stories,\u0027 causing the season to appear \u0027stagnant.\u0027The sentiment was shared by Variety who stated that Frank\u0027s absence left the season \u0027scrambling\u0027 when it came to to a plot. But almost all viewers have been praising the additions of Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear - who play a menacing brother-sister combo who run a conglomerate and are determined to force Claire\u0027s hand repeatedly. Other stellar performances are also consistently referenced, including Patricia Clarkson.Before you binge watch House of Cards\u0027 sixth season, here is what you need to know!House of Cards reviews IndieWire  \u0027More than half the final season passes before “House of Cards” feels like Claire Underwood’s (Robin Wright) story instead of his epilogue, and even when she starts to see her vision borne out, the lingering questions are all about Frank,\u0027 the review stated. \u0027Despite the hype, Season 6 isn’t Claire’s show. It’s still Frank’s, which undercuts the season’s many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant.\u0027 They added that the show started to feel a lot like a \u0027murder-mystery\u0027 - but not exactly in a good way.  \u0027Seeing it this way provides a bit of goofy levity to a series always toeing the line between pompous prestige and soapy melodrama, even if the story’s morbid obsession with how Frank died sparks bad memories of “This Is Us,” Jack Pearson, and a slow-cooker. The review did praise the performance of Patricia Clarkson as Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade Jane Davis.           The cast at the season six premiere on October 22 It said: \u0027 After joining the cast in Season 5, the Oscar nominee  operates on another level than the rest of the cast — another show, even.\u0027About the show\u0027s shortcomings, Indiewire said: \u0027When Claire addressed the camera and said, “My turn” and all but erased her camera-whore hubby from control, there was no reason the audience should believe otherwise. \u0027Instead, five of the eight final episodes over-emphasize his importance and fail to create arcs worthy of Wright’s talents or Claire’s iniduality.

They said: \u0027Cards has always been a show whose plot contortions could confuse and whose incremental intrigue could bore, and those problems are worse now that everyone seems to be whispering.\u0027In their review, the Atlantic criticized the slow movement in which the show finally gets around to giving Claire her time to shine. And even when she does, it\u0027s often at the detriment to real world implications.Unfortunately, it isn’t until more than halfway through the eight-episode season that Claire’s big plan becomes clear. When it does, it involves Wright making a hammy, malevolent parody of gendered expectations, brilliantly puncturing the gunmetal patina that’s fallen upon the show and helping bury the memory of Frank’s excesses. The plot surely must hurl toward doom, but a deeper tragedy is suggested: if only this woman never had to hide her true self.

Of the three groups, vegetarians experienced the most negative feelings and enjoyed social occasions least.Lead author Dr John Nezlek, from the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Poznan, Poland, said: ‘Sometimes unwittingly, and sometimes intentionally, vegetarians may be excluded from social events or made to feel odd or different because they are vegetarians.

Tuno will be available in cans, and in pouches in flavours ranging from sweet chilli to sesame ginger.Eric Woods, managing director of Worldwide Food Associates, which is distributing the product, said it was ‘a tasty, healthy and convenient option’ which would transform the meat-free food market.Similar questions – asking how well their day had gone and how optimistic they were about the future – were used to assess depressive tendencies.Vegetarians scored 4.62 for self-respect and meat-eaters 5.33, where a lower score was worse. They were also more likely to be depressed and unsatisfied with their life, the study found.The authors, also from the College of William and Mary in Virginia, suggested vegetarians may suffer because they are seen by meat-eaters as morally superior.They added: ‘Given that many celebrities advocate some type of vegetarian diet, non-vegetarians may feel that vegetarians are “putting on airs” and that they are “too good” for non-vegetarians.’Twenty-four vegetarians, including some vegans, took part in the study. They were compared with 323 omnivores and 56 ‘semi-vegetarians’, some of whom ate fish or only avoided red meat.When asked whether they felt they led a purposeful existence, vegetarians saw less meaning in life than the other groups, according to researchers. They were also more likely to experience stress and embarrassment.However, a spokesman for the Vegetarian Society disputed the findings, saying: ‘What we see when people adopt a veggie diet in line with their values is they feel excited and positive about the contribution they are making.’The study appears in the journal Ecology of Food and Nutrition.

Truly believing she was investing in a happy ever after, she handed over an eye-watering £12,600.What followed was, well . . . nothing. No romantic dinners. No nights at the opera. Not even a shared pot of tea. She didn’t receive so much as a call from a potential Mr Right.When she demanded her money back, Ms Burki, who was attracted to the agency’s promise of discretion, found herself caught up in a high-profile court case that has been pored over — and, in part, ridiculed — on social media. Three months ago, Ms Burki won a High Court battle to recover her fees after the judge ruled she had been ‘deceived’ and ‘misled’ by Seventy Thirty. It was an empty victory.For not only did the company successfully sue her for £5,000 libel damages for writing a damning Google review, in which she described it as a ‘scam’, today she is still very much single.

So much so that she has stopped dreaming of her happy ever after.‘I’m finding it hard right now. I no longer have dreams. I used to dream of meeting someone, of having a future, when I went to these people. Now, I don’t know what’s next,’ she says.‘I wanted someone to share my life. I love spending time with my children, but I missed adult company. \u0027I missed the stimulation of a conversation, of sitting there with someone who cares about me, of sharing a bottle of wine with someone who says: “What happened to you today?” and who takes what you say to heart.‘But how do you meet a man who shares your interests and accepts that you are an independent, strong woman when you’re in your 40s?’Her story will resonate with thousands of successful women of a certain age all over the country.

This allows her to privately educate her two youngest daughters, while paying for sailing holidays in the Caribbean, trips to the theatre and heaven knows what else.But something is missing from her life, she says. ‘I’ve reached a stage where work no longer gives me the thrill it did. I want something more meaningful. Material things don’t matter so much now.’When Ms Burki moved from Cannes to London, she was, she says, initially excited about meeting new people. The day the mob put a hit on Johnny Carson:  P.I. reveals...Single mother, 21, who posed as lonely heart on Islamic...Buy it if you dare!

But the reality turned out to be very different.‘Most of the people I knew were married,’ she says. ‘The only things I was invited to were things with the kids. \u0027When you’re single, you don’t get invited to suppers where there are couples, as you’re the odd one out.‘The moment a woman orces her husband, she’s out, because the wives fear you might set your sights on their husband. \u0027My friends know I’m on my own. They knew I wanted a fourth child, but you’re not on their priority list. They’re not looking out for you.‘They think you have an adventurous life because you can go out for drinks when they have to go home to their husbands. But all I wanted was to go home to a husband, too.’Not that she readily confided in others about her loneliness. ‘You don’t want to seem needy. When I told one girlfriend how tired I was of doing everything on my own and that I wanted to be supported by a man who shared my interests, she said I should go to a pub in Chelsea where all these 60-plus single men drink.‘She said they were wealthy and I could hook up with one of them and inherit their house.

Is that how you look at me? Am I the sort of woman who deserves nothing better? Why can’t you set me up with someone my own age? Her husband’s colleagues were all hedge fund billionaires. They had crazy criteria for women — not to mention crazy sexual quirks.‘They wanted someone definitely younger, definitely slimmer, definitely taller. They didn’t want me.’Ms Burki, who says she is ‘5ft 2in and five kilos too heavy’, tried going out with single girlfriends, but it was never really her scene.‘I went to Annabel’s and other places in Mayfair, hoping to meet the right man, but I’m so tired in the evening due to everything I’ve had to do during the day and worrying about whatever might be going on with one of my daughters that I don’t have the energy to put on a fake smile and pretend to be this extrovert person.‘When you’re in your 40s, you’re not as brazen as you were. I’m no longer flirty and 30, so I don’t go to bars and say: “Here I am.” It feels desperate.‘How does an independent woman, who doesn’t seem to need a man, convince a guy you do need them?‘I know I scare people away because I’m too earnest — not smiley enough — and I have a dry sense of humour. In my experience, that’s a turn-off to men. A guy needs to be reassured and admired. They say they want a successful woman, but they don’t.’She adds: ‘Sometimes, I wish I was a man, who could go out to a club, have random sex with someone, then go home. But I’m not. It wouldn’t work for me. Sex has to be meaningful.’          When Ms Burki moved from Cannes to London, she was initially excited about meeting new people, but reality did not turn out that way and she was left disappointed Ms Burki had a handful of brief flings before enlisting the services of Seventy Thirty, but few of them were satisfying and none lasted.Overwhelmed by feelings of emptiness, she even consulted psychics, tarot card readers and astrologers, searching for hope. ‘You’re looking for answers,’ she says. ‘You want to be reassured things will turn out the way you want them to. I asked one psychic if I was going to have another child. They told me I was going to have a grandchild. I said: “Forget it.”‘I began to feel that I was beyond going out. I’d sit at home, reading or watching a film with a bottle of wine and convince myself I was happy. Wine numbs your feelings.\u0027It serves as a replacement for your loneliness, but the effect soon wears off. I don’t do it every night. I have to lose a few kilos,’ Ms Burki laughs.Once she relaxes, she is thoroughly good company, with a lively mind and dry, self-deprecating sense of humour. But, as she says, she can be ‘stand-offish’ when you first meet her. She’d hoped Seventy Thirty would grease the wheels of the initial awkward introductions.‘The idea that something can be pre-arranged by a professional appealed to me,’ she says.   Tereza Burki (right) hoped the dating agency, run by Susie Ambrose (left) would help her get past the awkward situations of new introductions but was not found a single match‘They pick the people and vet them, so you know who you are meeting and that their intentions are honest and they want the same thing as you.‘OK, so they may meet you and decide they don’t want a future, but they are out there looking for the same thing: a relationship that will end with living with someone, marriage and children, whatever.’She first approached the agency in October 2013 and visited its elegant, red-brick townhouse offices, where she was shown CVs of eligible bachelors on an iPad.‘They showed me a guy who was in a T-shirt, very fit, leaning against a Mercedes in front of a nice house. \u0027He had this air of nonchalance and well-being. He was about my age. I thought: “He looks nice.”‘I said: “But I’m short, I’m not very young and I have kids. Are you sure this man you’re showing me wants someone like me?” They said: “Oh yes. Your experience and intellect will really appeal to them.’’ Ms Burki dithered over whether or not to join the agency. ‘My gut feeling was telling me not to.’But the agency continued to email her on a monthly basis. After a fling, which didn’t last, with an American she’d met ‘by chance’ in Geneva, she decided to go back a year later and signed the contract.‘The psychological profile takes an hour,’ she says. ‘You bare your soul to these people and tell them your dreams and aspirations.’          The judge also agreed that claims there were a substantial number of wealthy male members actively engaged in the agency’s matchmaking services were falseCrucially, though, he agreed that claims there were a substantial number of wealthy male members actively engaged in the agency’s matchmaking services were false.In fact, the judge found that there were only around 100 active male members altogether, which could not be described as substantial ‘by any stretch of the imagination’. He concluded that Ms Burki was induced to enter her contract by ‘false’ representation and ordered Seventy Thirty to return her fee, along with damages of £500 for emotional distress.After the case, Ms Ambrose described Ms Burki’s expectations of Seventy Thirty as having been ‘lofty and unrealistic’. ‘She assumed it would be like internet dating, but we are a niche, exclusive agency, not a mainstream, mass-market online dating service,’ she said. ‘We are not going to have thousands of members because there simply aren’t thousands of single, wealthy, high-calibre prospects out there.’‘I should have been smarter,’ says Ms Burki. ‘What is it about us that we’re always looking for this perfect guy? We become so desperate that we want to believe whatever we’re sold.’ She shrugs.‘We have to keep trying to dig for truffles,’ she adds. ‘Perhaps I should start my own agency. \u0027Maybe dinners where a number of eligible people meet each other.

But then it can’t be easy when you are sharing a Buckingham Palace balcony with a sister-in-law like Meghan, who is hot off the Hollywood red carpet.While no ordinary woman can reasonably be expected to regain her pre-baby body for the third time so quickly, the burning question is how does Kate manage to look so great?GLAMOROUS GLADRAGSFollowing the birth in April of Prince Louis, Kate has only started performing public engagements over the past month.And it seems her five months maternity leave has given her time to think about an image revamp — as well as to study the form of her stylish sister-in-law.While Meghan may have got through an incredible 41 outfit changes during her first official foreign tour to Australia, at home Kate’s making sure her own outfits are just as eye-catching.She brought a touch of Hollywood glamour to a state dinner at Buckingham Palace last week when she wore a steel blue ruched Alexander McQueen ball-gown, her most daring to date.So could some of Meghan’s style be starting to rub off on her sister-in-law?The pair are certainly starting to share more designer labels.They are both fans of the Canadian brand Smythe, and this week Kate wore their new season £625 blazer for her visit to Coach Core in Essex, teaming it with pair of on-trend Aquatalia ankle boots and a roll-neck jumper.Since Meghan joined the Royal Family, Kate has also opted for more youthful, less matronly styles, such as the cap-sleeved, bright yellow, form-fitting Dolce and Gabbana dress she wore to Wimbledon — which could just as easily have been found in Meghan’s wardrobe.KINDEST CUT The first signs that Kate was back with a new image was her shorter hair cut.Celebrity hair stylist Jason Collier says: ‘Her hair looks a few inches shorter than when we last saw her, with some layers and lighter highlights added in for extra bounce and shine.‘Kate looks to have lightened her shade overall to give a sun-kissed effect. This is a great way to disguise any first greys her hair is naturally so dark that any grey strands would show up more noticeably, so the lightened locks are a clever move.‘The colour also lifts her skin tone, so overall it looks very fresh.‘Of course, Kate gave birth to her third child this year and is likely still to be experiencing the effects of post-partum hair loss, but her hair looks very thick and shiny.’  The Duchess (pictured at the Imperial War Museum) came back from maternity leave with a shorter haircut with some extra layers for \u0027bounce and shine\u0027 which lifts her skin toneCelebrity hairdresser Andrew Barton, creative director of the Headmasters salons, says Kate knows at-home conditioning is the key — and she does not stint.The fact that her hair may have thinned out a little during pregnancy may also have made it easier to manage — and he believes Kate’s skin tone is flattered by going two shades lighter and weaving in lots of subtle tones.‘She has got just enough length — it’s just a bit longer than shoulder length now, so it’s not too long that it gets in her way, but it can also be swept into an updo or tiara for formal occasions.’To keep her tresses shiny, Kate likes Kiehl’s Creme Silk Groom shampoo or Kerastase Nutriv Bain Oleo, brushed out with Mason Pearson bristle and nylon brushes, and held in place with L’Oreal’s Elnett hairspray.The tragedy that haunts Kate\u0027s family: How three young...Harry and Meghan¿s great Aussie day out!

Indeed, Kate has always viewed exercise as a non-negotiable part of her daily regime.Her appearance on the tennis court in Essex on Tuesday echoes her first solo appearance four months after the birth of Prince George.Then, she wore identical skinny jeans to take part in a game of volley-ball — and her Breton shirt rose up to reveal a stomach that was already wash-board flat.Her decision to wear a similar figure-hugging outfit this week shows how confident the Duchess is that she’s pulled it off again.A royal insider says: ‘Kate was concerned about the effects on her figure of a third child, particularly as she is also moving towards her late 30s. So she has made an extra special effort in toning up.’GOODBYE TO KOHL THAT Kate has instantly taken years off her looks by dispensing with the heavy kohl eye-liner which she was still wearing as recently as Prince Louis’s christening in July.Celebrity make-up artist Lauren Naylor says: ‘Kohl eyeliner around the entire eye can make them look smaller, and can be ageing, too.’Instead, taking a leaf out of sister-in-law Meghan’s book, Kate has switched to techniques to lift and open up her eyes by lining only the upper inner rim to reinforce the lash line and create a more subtle effect.          Kate has taken years off her looks by getting rid of the heavy kohl eye-liner she was still wearing as recently as JulyOn visits to Sloane Square department store Peter Jones, Kate picks favourite items from Bobbi Brown’s range, of which Meghan is also a fan.Her favourite items are Sandwash Pink lipstick and Saddle pencil to add definition to her eyebrows. Lauren says: ‘The colours she’s using give her complexion more warmth, so she’s glowing.ABS ATTACKTo HOME-in on her abs, Kate has been performing multiple sets of leg raises on a large mat, while resting her head on a feather pillow, according to a palace insider. This helps to bring the rectus abdominis — or ‘six pack’ muscles that separate in pregnancy — back together again.          The mother-of-three regularly exercises making sure she swims and works on her abs at homeKate is also said to like the Mutu System — a 12-week online programme of post-natal exercise to address this and also strengthen her pelvic floor.THAT WASPISH WAISTKate has a slender waist for any woman — let alone a 36-year-old mother of three.As well as eating well and exercising, she appeared to have gained barely more than 2st during her third pregnancy.Her secret is her on-going dedication to developing strong core muscles with regular post-natal abdominal exercises. While most mums have to trek to the gym, Kate is lucky enough to have the run of the state-of-the-art equipment at her Kensington Palace home.After the school run, she also visits her sister, Pippa, who recently gave birth to her first child, at her £17 million stucco-fronted mansion — which also has a high-tech fitness studio.The sisters are said to follow up their sessions, set to their favourite music, with a massage and a light organic lunch.Kate also enjoys plenty of spinning on her exercise bike, and cycles in the Norfolk countryside when she wants some fresh air.THE ARMS RACE Swimming plenty of lengths at the private pool at Buckingham Palace — a ten-minute drive from her private apartment at Kensington Palace — has also sculpted Kate’s lean arms.It’s also where she has taught her children to swim. An insider says: ‘Kate is a fast and effortless swimmer and has given George and Charlotte great water confidence.’Kate and William also have a private swimming pool at Anmer Hall, Norfolk, the private family home given to them by the Queen. On previous royal tours, Kate has told well-wishers she also keeps fit by ‘running after (the) kids’.Her other arm exercises are racing six-month-old Louis in his pushchair around the gardens of Kensington Palace — to his squeals of delight, closely followed by the family’s cocker iel, Lupo.STRIKE A POSEKate has concentrated hard on her posture. After the birth of Prince George, she has worked with personal trainer Louise Parker, who believes that every baby can take its toll.She has said: ‘Your posture needs a lot of auto-correction after pregnancy, so make sure you are opening up your chest, strengthening your upper back and your core.’Kate also looks long and lean, thanks to practising yoga.Although Meghan has the reputation for being the royals’ biggest devotee, Kate is also a keen follower of the discipline.While Meghan practises Vinyasa, which emphasises the smooth flow of movements, Kate follows Iyengar, which puts the emphasis on alignment and precision — and is also responsible for streamlining Nigella Lawson’s figure. As a result, Kate is more supple than she has ever been.WHAT A RACKETIt’s no wonder Kate looked so keen to pick up a tennis racket this week. As well as being the patron of The All England Club, home of the Wimbledon tournament, Kate is a mad-keen player.When in London during term-time, the family are regular players at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham, where there the dress code is that all tennis wear must be 80 per cent white. Kate has been spotted there perfecting her impressive serve.          Her family are regular players at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham and Kate is keen to get her eldest children playing tennis. Pictured Kate is joining a session as Basildon Sporting VillageShe has also worked hard to start George and Charlotte in the sport, saying that her eldest child already loves to ‘whack’ the ball.Observers who have seen the children on court say they are showing early signs of good hand-eye co-ordination.Kate is always up for a game of singles, too, against her husband.She has been overheard saying it’s one of the only sports in which she can beat William, who is also a keen all-round sportsman.GOLDEN GLOWMuch of Kate’s glow is down to plenty of exercise, fresh air and a consistently healthy diet. Her long devotion to sun protection has helped keep the first signs of ageing at bay.Instead, Kate gets a light glow from applying self-tan from the Xen Ten range — topped with a sweep of Bobbi Brown Shimmer Brick Bronze Shimmer.          Kate is said to wear ankle weights during gym sessions to help her keep her toned legsBlessed with good genes from her youthful-looking parents, Michael and Carole, it’s not thought that she has ever resorted to the Botox needle to keep any royal frown lines at bay.The Duchess is said to keep her complexion smooth with oxygen-infused products from Swiss skincare brand Karin Herzog.Since her pregnancy with Princess Charlotte, she has also been a devotee of rose hip oil to help guard against stretch marks.  PERFECT PINSThe 5ft 9in Duchess has always prided herself on her long, shapely legs. While they have always been strong, Kate’s legs have stayed toned, thanks to her regular half-hour running sessions. During her gym sessions, she also makes sure they get extra attention by wearing ankle weights while doing leg extension exercises to work her hamstrings. To avoid saddle-bags and to get the smooth silhouette that was on display this week, Kate also does sets of abductor and adductor exercises to target the inner and outer thigh muscles — as well as alternate lunges. THE QUEEN OF LEAN Despite having given birth to three children, Kate has barely gained a pound since her royal wedding day in April 2011.While she does not believe in dieting as such, she always makes health-conscious choices about what she eats, favouring smoothies.Kate is said to enjoy a green juice daily, often containing the algae spirulina, kale or spinach.She was also coached by lifestyle guru Louise Parker, author of Lean For Life: The Cookbook, after the birth of Prince George in 2013.Parker’s advice to clients is not to eat any white carbs until they have reached their goals. Recommended breakfasts include bircher muesli with oat bran topped with blueberries, snacks of oat cakes with peanut butter or hummus and lunches of lean protein and salads flavoured with garlic, ginger, herbs or lemon."},{"url":null,"title":"Hammond met betting giant curbs delayed","story":"    The row over the influence of the gambling lobby deepened last night after it emerged that Philip Hammond met one of the country’s largest betting firmsAnd his deputy, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss, had another ‘round table’ meeting with the firm in May.In addition, Treasury officials met representatives of the Association of British Bookmakers to discuss the Government’s review of gambling laws.Miss Crouch quit in protest at Mr Hammond delaying the promised reduction in the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) from £100 to £2.In her resignation letter, she expressed her anger at the gambling lobby, saying the decision had been taken following ‘commitments made by others to those with registered interests’.

He used a fake ID and his dinner money.By the time his mother and father Charles found out what was going on, he was losing around £1,000 a month.Mrs Ritchie, 62, a former consultant psychotherapist with the NHS in Sheffield, said Jack excluded himself from his local betting shops, but then started gambling online. He continued to gamble heavily after moving to Vietnam to teach English. Last November he threw himself from a roof in Hanoi.Mrs Ritchie said she hoped Tracey Crouch’s ‘brave’ decision would force the Government to act sooner. ‘People will die because of these delays,’ she added.                        Miss Crouch has campaigned for years on the evil of FOBTs, which are known as the crack cocaine of gambling. Her resignation statement said the delay could risk two suicides every day. The decision to slash the maximum stake to £2 followed a campaign by the Daily Mail.In the Lords, Labour spokesman Lord Griffiths criticised Mr Hammond’s delay, saying: ‘This is a victory for the bookies.‘What are their lobbying powers with the Treasury that they have been able to eke this progress out to suit their needs and to make huge profits from the result of their endeavours?’ Paddy Power Betfair is the UK’s third largest betting company.Treasury documents show that Mr Hammond invited a representative of the company to the Treasury on February 16 to take part in a round table event. Other companies, such as drugs firm GSK and Barclays Bank, also attended the meeting, held to discuss ‘European business engagement’.Miss Truss invited the firm to another round table meeting in the Treasury on May 9 for a discussion on ‘business and the economy’. Alongside Paddy Power Betfair were firms such as Heineken and Sky.In October 2017 and April 2018, Treasury officials met representatives of the Association of British Bookmakers. No ministers were present. Officials discussed the ABB’s submission to the gambling review on FOBT stakes. These meetings were revealed following a Freedom of Information request by Matt Zarb-Cousin from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling.Miss Crouch’s resignation on Thursday shocked Westminster. It emerged last night that a Commons vote on the secondary legislation needed to bring in the curbs on FOBT stakes was being delayed amid the threat of a rebellion by Tory backbenchers.Last night a Treasury spokesman said: ‘Treasury ministers, like all Government ministers, meet a wide variety of stakeholders in their work. These meetings are in line with civil service rules and are fully declared on gov.uk.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"KK UK Ku Klux Klansmen marching streets Britain drinking National Front","story":"    Gang dressed as Ku Klux Klan members outside a mosque in Newtownards, County Down. Recently the same Islamic centre came under attack after a pig\u0027s head was left on the doorstep and graffiti was written on the wallsFurthermore, my investigation into the identity of these hooded hatemongers, and their motives, has uncovered the disquieting presence of Tony Martin, a notorious Right-wing extremist based in South London and recently elected as leader of the racist National Front party, whose HQ is not in Ulster, but Hull.Martin, 41, and his English girlfriend, Sharon Mellor, 53 — a bottle-blonde darling of the British neo-fascist movement — admit to meeting the KKK gang in a pub, on the very night they paraded outside the Islamic centre, and even posing for photographs with them.This week, some members of this traditionally white, working-class, Loyalist Protestant community have been at pains to dismiss it all as a harmless pre-Halloween prank. One local resident pinned the offensive photograph in her window below a sign reading: ‘Dressing up is not a crime. We support ’Ards’ Boys.”Presumably this person hasn’t seen the recent Oscar-tipped Spike Lee movie BlacKkKlansman, which lays bare the horrific terror campaign waged by the KKK in pursuit of its dystopian ideological dream — to ‘purify’ America by purging the country of black and mixed-race people, Jews and Catholics, and create a country populated only by white Anglo-Saxons.And perhaps they hadn’t heard about the lynchings and the torching of homes by the KKK in the U.S. over the years. Nor of atrocities such as the bombing of a Baptist church in Mississippi, in 1964, which killed four innocent little girls and the murder of equally blameless Michael Donald, 19, abducted and taken to a lonely woods in Alabama, in 1981, then beaten to death and hanged from a tree.However, worshippers at Newtownards Islamic centre — which is based in a converted, end-of-terrace house and serves the town’s few dozen Muslims — certainly grasp the threat behind last Saturday’s ghastly showpiece, and are now deeply concerned for their safety.          Sharon Mellor admitted meeting the KKK gang in a pub, on the very night they paraded outside the Islamic centre, and even posing for photographs with them holding a cross and beerGiven that a severed pig’s head was left outside the Muslim prayer centre last year, and its congregation claim to have been videoed covertly as they arrive for Friday prayers, their fears are understandable. The Northern Irish authorities, mainstream politicians, churchmen and anti-Fascist groups are also united in the view that the incident constitutes a genuine ‘hate crime’ and the police have made it very clear they will investigate it as such.According to a new report by the Henry Jackson think-tank, Far Right terrorism and extremism — stoked by online radicalisation and violent rhetoric — have quadrupled during the past year in Britain and other Western nations.Security sources have reportedly told The Guardian newspaper that they know of 100 violent neo-Nazis and Far Right extremists committed to waging racial and religious war in Britain. At it again! Trump doubles down on calling the \u0027Fake News...Police investigate hate crime after gang dressed up as the...Father-of-one, 22, accused of being a \u0027fanatical\u0027 neo-Nazi...Share this articleAnd this week the BBC’s respected security correspondent Frank Gardner highlighted the rising threat from the Far Right, revealing four terror plots that have been foiled in the past year.Investigating the mounting threat from the Far Right has become such an onerous task that the police are to relinquish the lead role to MI5.So, were dangerously malevolent forces, rather than pranksters, behind the incident in Newtownards? My inquiries suggest it is entirely possible.There is also compelling evidence to suggest that this apparent attempt to instil fear in the town’s Muslim community, and stir up hatred towards them, could be linked back to mainland Britain.A video that has since emerged shows the mob making Nazi salutes as they march through town.           The gang went to a nearby Wetherspoons and pushed past a doorman when he tried to refuse their entry to the pub ‘If your car is black it gets stopped,’ shouts one of their number. From his threatening tone, he doesn’t sound as though he’s joking.Furthermore, when rampaging through Newtownards pubs after targeting the Islamic Centre, the gang seem to have commanded far more respect — perhaps fear would be a better word — than we might expect had they merely been raucous Halloween revellers.We might not think a burly pub doorman would be easily brushed aside, yet when the ‘bouncer’ at a Wetherspoon’s pub attempted to bar their entry, they simply pushed past him, according to a spokesman for the chain. More intriguing, however, is the presence of Tony Martin, whose repugnant NF party supports compulsory repatriation for all immigrants, and even their second and third generation, British-born family members.It just so happens that Martin, a former soldier now working as a builder and living in Croydon, has been spending a lot of time in Newtownards of late.He began visiting last February, when he started a relationship with Sharon Mellor, or ‘Shazza’, as she styles herself on a Facebook page littered with her expletive-ridden Right-wing rants. She lives in a block of flats barely half a mile from the targeted Islamic Centre.This week, Martin told me how they met during a Far Right demonstration at the TUC’s London headquarters earlier this year, to protest against the presence of Gerry Adams and other senior Sinn Fein party members — whose Irish Nationalist politics they despise — at a conference.Mellor, who hails from Gillingham, Kent, but moved to Northern Ireland 30 years ago to join the Ulster Defence Regiment, has boasted on social media of having tried to burn the Islamic centre down no less than three times. There is nothing to suggest this is true, and she now insists she was ‘joking’.          The gang dressed in pointy hoods and wearing white gown carrying wooden crosses drank in the pub in Northern Ireland Yet by sheer coincidence — as she and Martin would have us believe — they just happened to be drinking in one of the pubs visited by the white-robed gang, last Saturday evening. And, of course, they couldn’t resist being photographed with them.Rashly, she might now think, Mellor posted a picture of herself cuddling up to one of the KKK mob — a tall, well-built figure, clutching a beer bottle and a huge crucifix — on Facebook.Beneath it Mellor wrote: ‘Bumped into a few friends tonight … lol xxx’. Presumably she was joking again. The damning photograph was later deleted from her Facebook page. But not before it was seized upon by the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, who placed it on their website.Martin admitted to me that he also posed with the KKK gang, but said he had decided against publicising the photo in case it was ‘misconstrued’.Both strenuously deny that they were in any way involved in the sick stunt, however, and insist they don’t know the hooded men’s identities. Mellor described them as ‘random strangers — a few blokes dressed up for Halloween’.Ludicrously, Martin claimed their behaviour was no more offensive than that of the white man in Halloween fancy dress who made the news this week after being berated by a Tube passenger for wearing black greasepaint and an Afro wig to look like Jules Winnfield, the character played by Samuel L. Jackson in the film Pulp Fiction.          Under their frightening costumes one member of the gang was seen wearing bright red trainers as they paraded around the pub ‘Obviously the KKK have killed people over the years, but one of the Black Lives Matter activists shot five police officers in Dallas, didn’t he?’ he said. ‘People could be offended by any costume.’Artlessly, Martin then admitted that the NF stood to gain from being linked with the incident. ‘Getting a lot of publicity from this KKK thing will probably help us get a lot more members, because although the chattering classes are offended by it, most people are not really concerned, and it just reminds people we are out there,’ he told me, declining to reveal the size of NF’s current membership, which is believed to be minuscule.He also claimed the NF has a growing number of supporters in Northern Ireland, particularly from disillusioned Unionists, including hard-line Loyalist factions.All this is highly suspicious, we might think. Not least because — as the town’s Alliance Party national assembly representative Kellie Armstrong remarked resonantly — the Islamic Centre in Newtownards is unmarked and off the beaten track, and anyone who wished to find it would require good local knowledge.And because, as she also pointed out, the costumes worn by the gang can’t be bought in any fancy-dress shop in Northern Ireland, but appear to have been ordered from a specialist online store based in Dublin, which sells them — stained with fake blood, and complete with sword and chain — for 21 euros. ‘No, I don’t think this is a joke,’ she said flatly.Assuming anti-Islamist fanatics did orchestrate the incident, the wider implications are worrying. Latest figures from the Police Service of Northern Ireland show that the number of racist crimes and incidents has risen. In 201617 they surpassed sectarian cases — which have halved during the past 13 years — for the first time.          Sharon Mellor with her partner, Tony Martin, who is chairman of National Front right-wing group in HullThough the Muslim population in Ulster remains tiny compared to Britain as a whole — about 8,000 among more than 2 million — and there are only a handful of mosques, community leader Dr Raied Al-Wazzan says physical and verbal attacks, unheard of when he arrived in the province 28 years ago, have become commonplace.Meanwhile, again surely not coincidentally, Far-Right groups based in England are coming to regard Ulster as fertile ground and gaining a foothold in the province for the first time, according to Professor Peter Shirlow, Belfast-born director of Liverpool University’s Institute of Irish Studies.‘They are a growing menace,’ he said. ‘The peace process has seen immigrants come to work in what was previously a society 90 per cent made up of white people born in Northern Ireland. \u0027They make a great contribution but tend to live in areas under housing and employment stress.‘That has created the same sense as on the mainland — of British people being left behind and marginalised for far-Right groups to exploit.’Nowhere is this truer than in the town of Ballymena, where Britain First — which morphed six years ago out of the busted-flush British National Party — is aiming to drum up support from people disillusioned by the arrival of Eastern Europeans, rightly or wrongly perceived to be placing a strain on housing, school places and jobs.Significantly, perhaps, this party’s provocative tactics are redolent of those employed by the Ku Klux Klan. They include staging impromptu ‘mosque invasions’ and brandishing crosses on ‘Christian marches’ through predominantly Muslim areas. Whether they extend to posing outside mosques in KKK uniform is, of course, a matter for conjecture.However, like the NF’s Tony Martin, the BF leader, former Sevenoaks BNP councillor Paul Golding, 36, also beats a regular path to Ulster — frequently brushing with opposing local politicians (one of whom has accused him of intimidating him and his daughter) and with the law.          Though the Muslim population in Ulster remains tiny compared to Britain as a whole — about 8,000 among more than 2 million — and there are only a handful of mosquesHaving been jailed earlier this year at Folkestone magistrates court, along with his firebrand deputy Jayda Fransen, for harassing Muslims he wrongly believed to be involved in a rape trial, Golding now faces charges of inciting racial hatred at an anti-immigration rally in Ballymena. He is due in court on November 15.But whatever the true identity of the men beneath those pointy white hoods, the photograph that emerged this week came as no surprise to the veteran anti-fascist campaigner Dr Gerry Gable, editor of Searchlight magazine.For he knows from experience, of the neo-fascist underbelly that has long existed across the Irish Sea — pervading extreme Republican groups, as well as Loyalists — and of their close ties with like-minded groups on the mainland.‘The Far Right have a history of using Ireland as a backdoor to Britain, and now they are gaining ground around the world it seems they are trying to do it again,’ he told me. ‘That is why we would be foolish to pass this photograph off as a one-off stunt, and ignore it.‘You don’t just suddenly decide to go to an Islamic prayer centre dressed up as the KKK. \u0027I think these characters will turn out to be hard-line fascists. Dangerous people deliberately out to stoke hatred. \u0027That’s why it’s so important that they are unmasked, and we find out who was behind those white clothes.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/03/00/06091721000007D0-6348369-image-a-1_1541204174807.jpg","title":"PLATELLS PEOPLE Goopy Gwynnies not daft think","story":"    The fragrant high priestess of womanhood, Gwyneth Paltrow, tells us she is hitting the menopauseThe fragrant high priestess of womanhood, Gwyneth Paltrow, tells us she is hitting the menopause.She’s suffering wild mood swings, that make her ‘furious for no reason’, and hot sweats, despite being perimenopausal — the bit before the really bad stuff happens.As always with Gwynnie, help is at hand, if you can afford £70 a month for her herbal and vitamin treatment, curiously called ‘Madame Ovary’, available on her Goop ‘lifestyle brand’ website.Now, it’s easy to poke fun at her. She is, after all, very annoying. And she’s always flogging some right-on-trend miracle remedy to life’s travails. Some of them, as doctors have pointed out, are deeply dubious, little more than quackery.But to me, Gwynnie is the Donald Trump of womankind — maddening, preposterous, in your face . . . but quite often right.Despite her cringe-making announcement about her ‘conscious uncoupling’ from first husband Chris Martin, for example, their separation turned out to be one of the most amicable orces in showbusiness.Likewise, Gwynnie’s comments on her change of life are par for the course — intensely irritating and with a touch of her usual gobbledegook. ‘Menopause gets a really bad rap and needs rebranding,’ she says, before stressing that what society needs today is great examples of ‘aspirational menopausal women’.          Likewise, Gwynnie’s comments on her change of life are par for the course — intensely irritating and with a touch of her usual gobbledegookBut again, isn’t there some truth to what she says? Mention the menopause ten years ago — particularly in a career environment — and you’d have people reaching for the smelling salts.Yet 57 per cent of women suffer from its symptoms according to the NHS — and of those, 22 per cent say they can’t cope without medication.On the other hand, we have to keep things in perspective. For the majority of women it is not a torment, it’s just irritating.I’m one of the 87 per cent who did not suffer an emotional or physical breakdown as a result of it. We’re not all consumed by anger and hot flushes, but we should all feel compassion for those who are.Above all, modern women want to get on with our lives however it affects us. Which is why Gwynnie’s call for ‘menopausal, aspirational’ role models is not quite as daft as it sounds.   Eva so, er, comfyWhen Eva Herzigova first caused car crashes with her Hello Boys!

A series of 32 mini-quakes, all so slight that the tremors are virtually undetectable, have left the locals, if not shaking from reverberations, shaking with anger and fear.As Tina Rothery, a 56-year-old grandmother and former copywriter running a 24-hour a day protest to halt fracking at the site, said this week: ‘On this coast, people are going to bed scared. They are afraid of living in a manmade earthquake zone. At first, some thought we were wrong. Now, after the quakes, they realise we are right.’Beside her, Anne Powers, an 86-year-old former teacher from Manchester, is waving her walking stick ferociously at the security staff guarding the site’s gates.‘This is about doing something right for the next generation,’ she says, adding, ‘I won’t be alive to see them.’Fracking may have had triumphant claims of success in the States, particularly by Trump supporters, but the people of Blackpool are not convinced.Politics aside, however, the facts are impressive. The U.S. has unlocked underground reserves of oil and gas across 20 or more of its states.Oil production is increasing faster than at any time in the country’s history, even shaming the output of Saudi Arabia.Three quarters of America’s gas is now produced by fracking, with the result that domestic energy bills are being slashed.In fact, America has so much oil and gas to spare that it is exporting the stuff.Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, told the Guardian newspaper recently: ‘The U.S. is on course to be the world’s undisputed oil and gas growth story — and it’s because of fracking.’Then there’s the work boom, even in states that don’t have fracking. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says that the fracking industry has created 1.7 million new jobs already and there will be twice as many as that by 2035. What, you might ask, is there not to like?Quite a lot, insist the anti-fracking campaigners. They tell hideous, unprovable, tales of inflammable water coming out of taps because the liquid is contaminated by methane gas, a by-product of fracking. They also say mini-earthquakes have increased near fracking sites, which the U.S. Government does not deny.Most of all, the anti-fracking brigade argue that solar, wind and wave energy is better for our health and the environment than either ‘dirty coal’ or risky fracking. So why don’t we go down this route instead?They are the same arguments used by Tina Rothery and the rest of the mainly middle-aged band of female activists at the fracking site on Preston New Road near Blackpool. They are gaining support here and the driver of every fourth or fifth car driving by hoots their horn in solidarity since the earthquake scares.Judge slams fracking protesters for ‘treating the public as...Cuadrilla get go-ahead to start fracking in Lancashire as...Share this articleYesterday’s timely discovery of gas on the site could not have come at a better time. For Cuadrilla, the energy company running the drilling operation which also helps fund the research of North West Energy Task Force, has been under increasing pressure from campaigners.Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, said: ‘This is a good early indication of the gas potential that we have long talked about.’He added: ‘It provides early encouragement... of a significant source of natural gas to heat Lancashire and the UK’s homes and offices, while reducing our ever-growing reliance on expensive foreign imports.‘We have the potential to make a major difference to the UK energy supply and economic prosperity.’And not a moment too soon.For so keen was Cuadrilla to get the go-ahead to test fracking on Lancashire soil, that it signed up to stringent Government rules which mean that if there is a tremor deep underground of more than 0.5ml, akin to the vibrations of a passing car, a red light is triggered and drilling has to stop for 18 hours. This has happened four times.The ground near Blackpool was responding well to the injection of water and chemicals which open up pores to release the gas. However, the injection of sand, to hold the cracks open and let the gas flow out, was difficult without triggering the red signal that stops drilling.But the problem is that the threshold of 0.5ml (local magnitude) is far lower than that used in other countries, such as Canada.Mr Egan points out that if any other industry had to halt work when it triggered the same level of vibration, then ‘you would never get a wind farm or Crossrail built and many HGV’s would be off the road.’Indeed, the vibrations at Blackpool were smaller than those that can be caused by quarrying, artillery training, mining, tunnelling, underground trains, and pile-driving.There was a 3.1-magnitude natural earthquake on September 15 at 6.39pm near Newton Aycliffe in County Durham. That was several thousand times more powerful than the fracking tremors at Blackpool.Yet, according to British Geological Survey experts, nobody in Durham reported feeling it.This week Mr Egan was quoted in the Financial Times saying he wanted a rethink. ‘We are at the point now where we are saying that noose is so tight we’re just about to choke,’ he added.A warning also came from Dr Brian Baptie, a scientist at the British Geological Survey which helped draw up the red-light rules. He says the low threshold could make fracking economically unviable and halt the scientific tests at the site.And with every day that drilling is stopped, the cost to Cuadrilla is £94,000.           \u0027Fracking toxins cause cancer and birth defects\u0027: An anti-fracking campaigner blocks the road in LancashireHovering in the wings is the new fracking tsar Natascha Engel — appointed by the Prime Minister only weeks ago – who has backed the red-light system.However, she used her first interview in her new post to accuse anti-frackers of stifling debate, acting irrationally and trying to scare the daylights out of ordinary people.She believes fracking will create tens of thousands of jobs, provide Britain’s energy needs for 50 years and generate enough cash to ‘solve the social care crisis and save the NHS on its own’.Miss Engel first investigated fracking when drilling was proposed in her former North East Derbyshire constituency where she was the Labour MP.‘Mothers who had heard scare stories would be in my office weeping saying their children were going to die,’ she said. ‘They had been told that flames would leap from kitchen taps and their houses would collapse in earthquakes.’Alarmed at this, she set off to find out for herself, heading for a fracking site in Yorkshire.‘When I drove there I could see a huge steel rig and garish piping in the distance. I thought ‘‘Blimey. It’s massive.’’‘It turned out to be the theme park, Flamingo Land, one of the biggest rides in Europe. The frack site was so small that I drove past it’.Indeed, fracking has left local politicians of all persuasions scratching their heads. Lancashire County Council turned it down and Labour-run Blackpool Council doesn’t want it either.Even the Tories here are cautious. The resort’s Conservative leader Tony Williams, said this week: ‘We know that people around here are worried. We are also doubtful the promised jobs from fracking will ever materialise or help locals. Everyone wants Britain to be self-reliant on energy, but we question the dangers.’In the face of this impasse, the Government jumped in two years ago. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, then Communities Minister, approved plans for testing fracking in this country. He said the industry would support 64,000 new jobs and provide a new source of domestic energy.Cuadrilla, in a recent report, revealed that during the last quarter of 2017, spending in the Lancashire economy from its gas exploration operations has increased by more than £2 million to a total of £6.8 million.The total full-time and contract jobs which have been created now stands at 55.Cuadrilla also made £161,000 in community payments last year, some to people who live near the drilling site.In Blackpool they still get 18 million visitors a year, 99 per cent from Britain, who come for short stays or a night out.Yet fracking enthusiast and local hotelier Claire Smith says Blackpool needs more than just tourism.‘We have a lot of unemployment in this area. Tourism is what we do and we do it really, really well,’ she says. ‘But the upshot of that is a lot of employment is seasonal and involves only mid to low-end jobs.’ Fracking, she believes, could change all that.In the streets near the Grand Theatre where visitors were piling in on Wednesday night to see jazz icon Georgie Fame and some original band members of Sixties rock group, Manfred Mann, few agreed with her.A woman in her fifties was sitting on a bench smoking and had just finished work at a stall selling T-shirts. ‘What do you think of fracking?’ I asked her. She got up and started shouting. ‘F*** fracking’.Then she pointed to the empty shops which lined the pavement. ‘We need tourists here,’ she said. ‘They are not going to come when they have to drive in past a gas drilling site.’In the coffee bar opposite the Grand Theatre, three young men working behind the counter echoed her sentiments.‘We’ve had earthquakes here, just the other week. Jobs? You need to go to uni’ to do geography for the fracking work. The only ones hired from Blackpool will be cleaners and security staff. The rest will be brought in from abroad. It won’t change things for us.’Tomorrow the Blackpool Illuminations, a fantastic array of 3D and tableaux lighting along the promenade, closes for the winter. It is the moment that the jobless figures in the resort go up.Even when the summer season is in full swing, one in ten are without work here.Surely, new industry on the doorstep would help cure this resort’s troubles, whatever Tina and her anti-fracking activists have to say.The largest earthquake since Cuadrilla started fracking was 1.1ml. The British Geological Survey said this tremor was felt by just one person locally.And that person was living in a caravan at a camp close to the drill site, which is the stronghold of the activists themselves.This curious fact was reported in the local newspaper without a hint of suspicion.It’s enough to make you wonder if Blackpool is burying its head in its own Pleasure Beach sands.           This graphic shows how gas is driven out of shale deposits by pressure and pumped to the surface in fracking process"},{"url":null,"title":"Increased success IVF treatment causing drop number adoptions","story":"    Anthony Douglas, chief executive of Cafcass, the Government agency that represents children’s interests in family courts, said improvements in IVF is causing adoption rates to decreaseIn 1978 around 12,000 children were adopted in Britain each year, but last year there were only 4,350 children adopted by permanent new parents - a drop of almost 20 per cent in just two years at a time when the number of children in care rose to over 76,000. Following the Baby P scandal social workers were persuaded to remove more children from potentially dangerous homes, meaning the number of kids in care rose 20 per cent since 2008. Anthony Douglas, the chief executive of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass), who was himself adopted as a child, said the growing success of IVF means fewer people will consider adopting children.He told the Telegraph: \u0027IVF used to be around seven per cent successful and successful and now it\u0027s around 30 per cent.Czech Republic\u0027s PM hints that his country may follow...Seven puppies dumped in a trash bag at just a few hours old...Austria joins US and Hungary in backing out of UN migration...Can Donald Trump change the 14th amendment on birthright...Share this article\u0027So as a choice, adoption is competing with lots of other ways of having children.\u0027When I was adopted there was absolutely no support, the zeitgeist was he\u0027s better of not knowing.

Constantly checking social media, making it impossible to concentrate on a task at hand? Disconnecting and eliminating disruption could be just what you needFrench artist Paul Cézanne once remarked: “It’s so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.”Today, the challenge is not so much to begin a task, but to complete it. Digital innovators make a virtue of disruption, but their innovations have also had a more literal impact on our lives. Creative technologies have proliferated – you can make an album in your bedroom, write and publish a novel and create and display your artwork – but so have the number of channels vying for your attention.Any project you begin runs the risk of frequent distraction from multiple sources such as the constant, nagging hum of social media updates, group notifications and message alerts.There is no denying the power mobile phones hold over us. There’s even a phenomenon known as “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is the perception that your phone is buzzing when it’s not.It is a daily challenge to shut off the deluge of stimuli and try to focus, to centre yourself and be imaginative. It was the philosopher Aristotle who first put forward the idea of the tabula rasa: the young mind as a blank slate. In the literal sense, nothing relates to this more than the process of beginning to work on an empty page.Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at University of Plymouth, wrote a paper in 2009, where she supported the use of doodling as a cognitive process and aid for reducing daydreaming.Pen and paper are the original, and perhaps the ultimate creative platform, providing a physical connection between the mind and a tool for expression. They fuel the imagination and solidify thought.“There was a study (pdf) that compared students writing on paper and those writing notes on a keyboard, and the former came out better in tests. If you’re typing on your computer, whether you get notifications or not, you’re tempted to look in case there’s something there. You’re pulled away in case there’s an email or something might be happening on Facebook. That doesn’t exist if you use a pen and pad. Those notifications are really disruptive, it’s not just reading them, it’s the time it takes to refocus on the task. That’s a powerful reason to write on paper, whether it be real or digital.”What if there was a medium that provided a bridge between physical writing or drawing and the capability of a digital device, but with none of the disruption? Well, there is. reMarkable is a paper tablet that’s so natural and adaptable that it makes notebooks, sketchbooks and printouts redundant. It offers a paper-like reading, writing and drawing experience in a tactile device that filters out the digital noise around you.“There’s a digital epidemic going on right now. Far too many of us are addicted to checking our social media accounts several times per hour, or worse,” says Magnus Wanberg, founder and CEO of reMarkable. “This is forming our habits in a negative way when it comes to our ability to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. We have based our entire product and company on helping people focus. While most tech companies focus on artificial intelligence, at reMarkable we work to enhance human intelligence. This is why we designed the reMarkable tablet with no distractions or notifications.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

Could there be a more provocative title than that given by the exiled novelist to his latest satirical onslaught on the country of his birth? For, with China Dream, he co-opts the rhetoric of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to tell the story of a politician who is driven mad by memories of his own corruption.Xi first used the phrase shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist party in 2012, and Ma has responded “in a rush of rage” with a short, ferocious novel about the way turbo-capitalism and authoritarianism have combined to inform a Chinese dream that excludes all but a chosen few. “I wanted to give myself the challenge of encapsulating everything in as few words as possible,” he says, wryly adding that it will be interesting to see how the Chinese authorities react to the novel, given that they’ve outlawed so many “key words” online – “even the name Winnie-the-Pooh is banned because people joked that Xi Jinping resembled him”.A momentary silence falls as we consider the surreal possibility of the “paramount leader” being forced to ban his own slogan. But the reality, Ma acknowledges, is that censorship is now so all-encompassing that the novel will very probably not be allowed to exist in Chinese, even in Hong Kong, which has historically provided a toehold for work by dissident authors banned on the mainland.In a tranquil London cafe, close to the home he shares with his translator and partner Flora Drew and their four children, the risks this slight, 65-year-old writer is taking are hard to comprehend. Despite living in the UK for 17 years, he does not speak English. It’s not as if he hasn’t tried, says Drew, who translates our interview, but he has a stubborn devotion to his mother tongue and remains more engaged with goings-on in China than those in his adopted country. “Living in the west allows me to see through the fog of lies that shrouds my homeland,” he writes in the foreword to China Dream. During the interview, he invokes Dante’s Divine Comedy: “It’s only through being expelled that the poet gets to see heaven and hell and purgatory.”It was a perspective forced on him from his earliest days, as one of five children born into a well-to-do family in the provincial city of Qingdao in 1953. A childhood in which he had already shown promise as an artist came to an abrupt end with the start of the Cultural Revolution. He was 13 years old. His art teacher was persecuted as a “rightist” and his grandfather, a landlord and tea connoisseur, was executed. At 15, he joined an arts propaganda troupe, beginning an adult life that would take him through various industrial assignments to a job as a photojournalist. He married a dancer and had the regulation single child. Then a photography prize brought him to the attention of the authorities and he was transferred to work for the foreign propaganda unit of the Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing.There, living in a “one‑bed shack”, he connected with a buzzy young community of writers and artists. Officially, he worked as a journalist. Unofficially, he made and occasionally sold paintings. “Mostly they were stolen, but a man from the US embassy bought one for $40,” he recalls. “My hair was encrusted with oil paint and the walls were papered with my paintings.”In 1983, just as he turned 30, he hit the crisis that would upend his life. Divorced from his wife, who forbade him to make contact with his daughter, he was arrested for “spiritual pollution”. Though Ma was released, his shack was ransacked and his canvases ripped up. “I never painted again,” he says. “I saw what a fragile medium it was, and how vulnerable to abuse and persecution, and I asked myself what was I going to do for the rest of my life?”In his attempt to answer this question he converted to Buddhism and set off on a three-year journey across China on foot. At first, he was afraid even to record what he witnessed in his notebook, in case it fell into the wrong hands, but gradually, he says, “I saw that through literature I could paint my own reality. I could record history.”He arrived in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa to find a people whose traditions had been corrupted by poverty and political oppression even as they celebrated the 20th anniversary of their “liberation” to the status of autonomous region. In 1987, Ma poured his impressions into a collection of short stories, belatedly published in English as Stick Out Your Tongue. It was immediately banned by the Chinese censors, sending him into an exile from which he has never permanently returned, though until six years ago he was allowed to visit China, and continues to keep in close contact with friends and family.He turns up for the interview with a dramatically bandaged thumb, the result of an accident while building a shed in his garden, the explanation of which leads on to one of his latest frustrations. He had written a letter to one of his brothers inviting him to come over to help, he says, “but during this time there was a huge demo of disgruntled veterans demanding higher benefits, so the whole town had been sealed off and surrounded by armed police. No information was able to get in or out, so the letter has probably been handed over to the authorities. What happened there shows how today’s China is more extreme than anything George Orwell could have imagined, because these events don’t even reach public consciousness: it’s as if they never happened.”Erasure of memory is the abiding theme of Ma’s work, whether through the literal motif of an unconscious man in his epic 2008 novel Beijing Coma, set around Tiananmen Square, or through the allegorical pursuit of a recipe for “Old Lady Broth of Amnesia” to which the municipal leader Ma Daode devotes himself in China Dream, tormented by a past in which he drove his own parents to suicide by denouncing them. “The process of dragging back memories that are being constantly erased, especially from my position of exile, makes even more important to me the primacy of memory,” Ma says, “and how it not only involves a nation’s sense of history but a person’s sense of self.”His satire is always firmly located in violations of the human body. Stick Out Your Tongue told stories of ritual rape and multi-generational incest. In his 2013 novel, The Dark Road, aborted late-term foetuses are carried around in plastic bags or boiled in Cantonese restaurants to make potency soups for men. The fourth of China Dream’s seven episodes takes Ma Daode to a strip club, where VIPs have orgies in Mao’s private room with women who are identified only by numbers. The reason for this, he explains, is because “totalitarianism not only seeks to control the thought but also the body in which those thoughts are housed”.“As a writer, when you are trying to describe your characters, there’s a visceral connection to their being. But in my exploration of the body I’m always trying to show that in these systems, when a regime is trying to hurt a person’s physical being, at the heart of it is an attempt to crush their soul. Sometimes, the body can survive but a lot of the time it becomes no more than a carcass.”Red Dust, his semi-fictionalised 2001 account of his life-changing three-year journey, introduced another persistent theme, betrayal. It recounted how he was twice betrayed by an actor girlfriend, whom he, in turn, considered denouncing to the film studio that employed her, out of jealousy over her infidelity. None of his characters is without blame, but neither are they entirely evil. Even Ma Doade in China Dream attempts to warn protesters that they will be killed if they refuse to move out when bulldozers arrive to clear their homes for redevelopment.Ma relates his story quietly and urgently through Drew, keeping his own record of the conversation in spidery Chinese script. The couple met in 1997 when she was working on a TV documentary about the handover of Hong Kong to China and he was one of the few local people who agreed to speak. He invited her to a poetry reading and gave her all his books to read she stayed on to finish them, and by the time she left they were together. He moved briefly to Germany after the handover before joining her in London. She has translated everything he has written since. Does she worry that his repeated attacks on China may put him in danger? “This is the first time I’ve felt concerned, because there’s a brazenness to the behaviour now and they can do it without any backlash at all,” she says.But the couple have kept faith with the best of the country, sending their 15-year-old son to study martial arts at a Shaolin monastery and to spend time with his Chinese family. Ma plans to travel to the Hong Kong literary festival this month, to present his novel in English. “I refuse to be afraid,” he says. “The disregard for truth is infectious. It also explains the rise of Trump. We need to protect concepts of humanity, and freedom can’t be taken for granted. We have to remain constantly vigilant.

As a device for understanding ourselves and the world, nothing else comes close. Poetry is language at its keenest, and the poetry of these islands is our greatest achievement.Accordingly, the laureateship should be the highest office in poetry and the laureate should be  of those ideals. It should be awarded to a poet of true recognition, a poet admired by both their fellow poets and by the public, a poet who is both expert and enthusiast, and a poet who is an accomplished practitioner of the art as well as its champion and ambassador. No one else will do. It should be a poet who listens more than they talk, who reads more than they write, who thinks more of other poets’ work than they do of their own, and who knows and cares deeply about the poets of the past, because there are more of them than us and they are better. If you put the laurel crown on your head and you haven’t read the whole of Beowulf or the Iliad, or don’t know who wrote Lycidas, or can’t recite a poem by Sappho or Emily Dickinson, or can’t name a poem by Derek Walcott, then you are not worthy of the role. Prepare to be embarrassed at your first interview. The great majority of the best poetry ever written is freely available so not to have to read it – even just to disagree with it – is inexcusable. The laureateship requires experience and dignity. We’re not looking to appoint the mayor of Toytown or a mascot for our everyday aspirations. Or someone who has published four books, sits on five committees, has judged six prizes and is a nice person, or someone who is a shop-steward for contemporary values first and a poet second (or third).If you’re still in the running at this stage, you also need to be someone who will get out from behind the keyboard and the dusty tomes, come down from the ivory tower or the sunlit garret or the senior common room, and be prepared to go into the schools, prisons, communities and hospices. In fact you will probably have been doing that for thirty years. And you should happily go to the theatres and festivals and nightclubs to see and hear live poetry being spoken and performed. And you should have a long-term project in mind, like Andrew Motion’s Poetry Archive or Carol Ann Duffy’s award for new work. And you should be thinking about how to encourage and promote the poets of the future, because there will be more of them than us and they will be better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd53a757bdfb1f0d4c3a8ba8d571435bdf3e9e5/0_1566_2533_1520/master/2533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49b44aa1a8e36f12b860f6585c193105","title":"david cameron legacy shepherds hut","story":"The former prime minister was said to be planning a political comeback. The only possible response is hahahahahaha“David Cameron eyes return to frontline politics.” God, why couldn’t that sentence stop after the word frontline? Why does “politics” have to ruin everything? I suppose it’s because Cameron is more of the type who’d have been drinking wine back at the chateau in the first world war. “We’re right behind you!” brays General Melchett at Baldrick on the eve of sending his men over the top. “About 35 miles behind you,” mutters Blackadder.Having said all that, I do hope our former prime minister’s forthcoming memoirs are entitled David Cameron’s War, with a cover picture of him doing a thousand-yard stare in a White Stuff fleece. (Out of shot, the back of it reads: “Val d’Isère 2018 – THE POWDER AND THE GLORY BOYS!!!”)And so to an eye-catching report in the Sun, in which a “friend” of Cameron does a spectacular drive-by on him, unintentionally or otherwise. According to this mate, Cameron is toying with a return to politics, and fancies being foreign secretary. It’s rather difficult to know precisely what to make of a story in which almost every quote sounds like it was said for a dare. “David is dedicated to public service” “David is “bored shitless” David “has often said he wouldn’t rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally”. To which the only possible response is: ahahahahahahahahahahaha. I mean, I wouldn’t rule out opening a $300m action movie, but I guess I’m just a glass-half-full kinda gal. The glass contains liquid LSD.Even Cameron’s more achievable goals appear to be eluding him. He still seems to be in his £25,000 shepherd’s hut, writing this wildly called-for book of his, with the publication date now pushed back again to some unspecified date next year. Perhaps the shepherd’s hut could be towed to some remote snowy location, where a captive Cameron would be forced to write the book readers would like to read as opposed to the one he wants to write. It’s only a vague idea. I think I saw a movie about it once.Either way, Cameron is beginning to feel like the George RR Martin of political memoirists, except without any actual fans. The author on whose novel series Game of Thrones is based has famously delayed and delayed the release of Winds of Winter, the conclusion to his epic, to the point where the TV series has overshot the books and will wrap it all up before the source material gets there itself. Perhaps the same could be done for Cameron. Surely at some point the public can’t wait any longer and a couple of pervy telly producers will have to step in and finish it for Dave, with some post-imperial self-castration and the dehumanising rape of a couple of UK economic regions. Hey – it was consensual by the end.As for layout, it is fashionable for gentlemen scribes to adorn their frontispieces with some quotation from Heraclitus or Bowie or whoever. But it would perhaps be apt if Cameron’s featured only that hilariously clunky and portentous line from Game of Thrones: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” Cue titles, and a little mechanical House of Chipping Norton rising up from a map before getting completely torched by a passing dragon. “When you play the game of thrones, you – oh.”Speaking of bazillion-dollar-an-episode TV dramas, what ghastly news of Dave’s worthy foe, Arron Banks. I am shocked to learn that the motorbike insurer and anti-elitist diamond mine boss who bankrolled the provisional wing of the leave campaign is under criminal investigation. The Electoral Commission this week confirmed it has asked the National Crime Agency to investigate whether one of Banks’ Isle of Man-based companies was the illegal source of £8m in Brexit campaign funding.On the plus side, this feels like a great series two arc for the landmark US TV adaptation of The Bad Boys of Brexit – Arron’s searingly searing account of how some bad boys did a Brexit. It wasn’t so long ago, you may recall, that Arron and the rest of the Nigel Farage entourage – the enFarage, if you will – were claiming to be off to LA to ink a deal with a major studio to adapt this opus for a $10m-an-episode six-part series. This was due to have begun principal photography in early 2018. According to the ’s well-briefed report on the matter: “Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey or Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch have been tipped to play Mr Farage.”Another creative project that seems to have had its start date postponed, there. However, I do hope plans are being made to adapt it for the 2019 HMP Frankland panto. Perfectly possible that Spacey could still star. As for the showrunner, perhaps Banks himself might be on hand to take the reins.Or perhaps not. It’s like that old insurance proverb: you come at the GoSkippy king, you best not miss. Naturally, Banks has had something to say on the matter of his elevation to suspect. I usually enjoy Arron’s press statements, which sound like he honked them into a car speakerphone while flooring his Vauxhall Cavalier on the way to a suppliers’ meeting in a BizSpace on the Avon ring road. But this one ends with a poorly punctuated attempt to create a false equivalence with the political donations of … oh dear, “foreign national George Soros”. Well, I wonder what all that can mean.Yet for all of Banks’s artless grotesquery and all Cameron’s artful civility, there is something rather fitting about the pair representing the two sides of the event that sundered the nation – and not simply because either would hate the comparison. They are two chancers, both alike in dignity, with Banks just the Moriarty to Cameron’s Barratt Holmes.Over two years since Cameron ran out on his mess, what strikes you more than anything is his smalltimery. With the obvious exception of the giant, epoch-defining balls-up he made on his own terms, he is almost without other legacy. There is just … nothing much there, with the exception of gay marriage, which you might reasonably have expected an alternative-timeline Labour government to have done anyway. Austerity will always be regarded as a George Osborne-owned project. But listening to the chatter and the chuntering at Tory conference this year, I had to remind myself that Cameron had ever been prime minister. Even in his own party, it is as if the Cameroons never happened.Maybe his book will change all that. Or maybe it will confirm there was even less to him than ultimately met the eye. Maybe he is sitting in his £25,000 wheeled shepherd’s hut right now, wondering about the best “way in” to his own story – still unable to come to terms with the fact that history is only ever going to be able to judge him as another very bad boy of Brexit indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29df010bbf56dda84d03531a122c9bf5e4a4aacc/0_18_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=048f627d49896c7581de4c75b5c2531b","title":"the guardian view on arron banks where did the money come from","story":"Western democracies are vulnerable to subversion and murky offshore wealth can be used to support far-right populists. Is that what happened with the Brexit vote? It has been a year since the Electoral Commission, which regulates party and election finance, announced its investigation into Arron Banks, the biggest financial backer of the 2016 Brexit campaign. In response, the businessman sarcastically tweeted “Gosh I’m terrified”. He now has reason to be. This week the regulator\u0026nbspsaid\u0026nbspit had grounds to suspect that some of the £8m with which he funded the unofficial Leave.EU campaign came from an offshore company.The regulator says a “number of criminal offences” may have been committed the National Crime Agency is on the trail. A graver allegation is being considered: whether Mr Banks was not the source of the funding for the Leave.EU campaign. If true, this begs the question: did the money itself come from a foreign source? Mr Banks denies receiving any “foreign donations”. Yet this is a serious allegation.All this poses big questions for the nature of the decisions that this country faces. Britain held a referendum in 2016 that indulged ignorance and irresponsibility, abandoning the considered judgment of representative democracy. Our electoral laws proved ill-equipped for the manipulation of social media. The referendum campaign was unedifying and the outcome was not legally binding. MPs accepted the result and Britain is on its way to leaving the European Union. But the campaign was not deemed so fraudulent that it would damage voters’ trust in our democracy.Mr Banks spends money and time trolling British politics. He has helped destabilise Britain with Brexit and political parties by funding Ukip. He is currently trying to have pro-remain Tory MPs deselected. The wit and political instinct is his own. But is the money? It might be that Mr Banks is simply a rich, clever opportunist that he spotted, and nurtured, a growing disillusionment with elites that he knew traditional structures were dissolving and that parties forged in another age had begun to look obsolete that as a political entrepreneur he could fund a startup to shake things up. This looks like a generous interpretation.Western democracies are vulnerable to subversion. Murky offshore wealth can be used support proxy political actors, who often trade in far-right populism. Nowhere is that being more thoroughly exposed than in the work of the US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is examining links between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government. Mr Mueller has indicted or secured guilty pleas from 32 people. It was reported that Mr Banks and his inner circle were of interest to Mr Mueller’s investigation. All a witch-hunt, said Mr Banks.If it is found that crimes have been committed then Mr Banks ought to face the consequences. But Leave.EU was not the designated Brexit campaign. That was Vote Leave, which is appealing against a finding of wrongdoing. It is one thing to show that electoral law has been broken. It is another to show that a foreign-funded campaign was so effective that it could mobilise a large enough group of voters who would have not been mobilised otherwise. That is why senior Tories ought to have come forward to give criminal investigators political backing to pursue Mr Banks. Ministers could have done this by saying the allegations were grave and that justice must run its course. If it is conclusively and authoritatively shown that the referendum was manipulated and the result unsafe, the headlong rush to leave the EU ought to be paused. We are not there – yet. Ministers are rightly wary of appearing to interfere with the poll result in 2016. But they must also ensure that elections cannot be stolen and that votes are not robbed of their meaning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d0bf3bc8841959ddced4e1cd19b30eaadfa1dc/325_426_3081_1849/master/3081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=587a17fed0a2562b37df07bb0fa25c46","title":"meet the ebay doers 15 budding businesses ready to go big","story":"Chosen from hundreds of inventive, intelligent entries, these 15 emerging startups are on their way to bigger and better things – eBay and the  Labs have teamed up to help take them thereWe had a theory: that everyone’s got a brilliant business idea in them. We tested it out, asking you to tell us yours. And we were right a barrage of budding or would-be businesses came in. Inventions inspired and outlandish. Things of beauty and utility. Problems solved, gaps filled, and a whole host of things we didn’t know we wanted, but do now.Hundreds of ingenious ideas from imaginative, interested people. And a few that may not make it out of the pub – but not many.We whittled those down, putting the favourites in front of our judging panel – Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Touker Suleyman, eBay’s Kirsty Keoghan, and the ’s Hamish Nicklin – who together chose 15 people, or pairs, with the strongest ideas, plus the passion and commitment to take them forwards. These 15 became the eBay Doers – joining our 10-week incubator aimed at helping people grow those bright ideas into burgeoning businesses with workshops, funding and expert mentorship from entrepreneurs. Say hello to …Johanne-Marie Bonsu – Eden \u0026amp Jo (plant-based face masks)Bonsu’s beauty range has been three years in the making. “I’d been beauty blogging for a while and readers would always ask me if I sold products,” she says. “I took a while creating different blends – all plant-based and handmade,” she says. After launching this summer, Bonsu wants to use eBay’s help on her marketing strategy. “I’d love to get to the stage where Eden \u0026amp Jo is a really trusted brand.”Mentor Ade HassanHellen Stirling-Baker – Small Stuff UK (ethical wooden toys)Stirling-Baker has big plans for Small Stuff. Having started out selling handmade clothes, she now plans to launch wooden toys with a meaningful legacy. “The wood is from a sustainable forest in Scotland. Each toy comes with a certificate of origin.” After taking time out due to postnatal depression, she is looking forward to getting her new toys on eBay. “I want to create products that make people say: ‘I love the ethos behind that brand.’ And it’d be great to hear my little boy say: ‘My Mum did that.’”Mentors Adam and Sinead MurphyCatalina Hoyos Loarer and Ildut Loarer – Pap Yay (paper puzzle block toy)A play on “papier”, Pap Yay was born out of a shared love of design and a desire to find an alternative to the plastic tat touted to new parents. “We wanted to create a beautiful product parents didn’t have to hide,” France-born Loarer explains. “That also leaves space for the imagination, challenging children of different ages.” Boosting their savings with a Kickstarter campaign, the couple currently work out of their Hackney flat. They look forward to seeing how the doers scheme will help them manage big orders. “It’s been an amazing experience so far,” says Loarer. Mentors Adam and Sinead Murphy.Catherine Riney – Our World Travel Logs (printed travel logs and notebooks)After 20 years in business management, Riney decided to act on her idea last year. “I’ve lived in three different countries and I do feel like a citizen of the world,” she says. Aimed at helping travellers engage with their journeys and destinations, Riney hopes her sustainable travel logs will help people think about their impact on the world. “I’m starting a campaign #WeHaveNoticed about positive things people have done around sustainability. I believe everyone can make a difference, however small.”Mentor Cathy McCartyColin Sinclair – Snail Offence (snail-repelling copper fences)“We tried everything, from radiator brush bristles to cat fur,” says Sinclair of his quest to stop slugs and snails decimating his plants, without killing them. “They’re like little ninjas.” After trialling several prototypes, including a windmill that lifted the culprits away, Sinclair came up with the copper fence – an attractive, ingenious alternative. He hopes the scheme can help them reach a wider audience. “Now it’s about building the brand.” Mentor Cathy McCartyAmy Paris and Laura Carr – The London Sleep Company (sleep cosmetics and journal)Working in a high-pressured law firm, Paris struggled with her sleep, and would concoct cosmetic blends to help. Testing them out on colleagues, The London Sleep Company was born. Two years of research later, Paris and her fiancee Carr are ready to launch a range. When it comes to a five-year plan, the pair are dreaming big. “We want to be a one-stop sleep shop,” says Paris. “We’d like to add bed linen, and be sold in any sector where sleep is important. To have a mentor’s input to help us will be invaluable.”Mentors Clare Haines and Melissa BurtonMichele Duplessis and Shannon Teague – Pop ’n Sprinkle (sprinkle-on popcorn flavours)The motivation for Duplessis’ and Teague’s business is simple: “We’re obsessed with popcorn.” Moving to London from South Africa, the friends were confused to find just two flavours on offer at the cinema. “In South Africa, you have at least five sprinkle-on flavours,” says Duplessis. Spotting an opportunity, they worked with a manufacturer to develop six flavours, which they’ve been selling online. The next challenge is to build brand awareness and take Pop ’n Sprinkle into the retail market.Mentors Claire Haines and Melissa BurtonEd Spurr – Acorn vases (green gifts)Allowing customers to grow elegant living oak trees from acorns at home, art dealer Spurr’s self-designed glass vases stem from a combined love of beautiful things and nature. First conceived as gifts for his artists, Spurr feels the vases will have wide appeal. “They’ll be interesting to design enthusiasts, tree lovers, botanists, horticulturists and also families with children,” he says. “I think it’s wonderful that from this piece of wood you can grow a tree that’ll become 500 years old.” With the support of eBay he wants to spread his message worldwide. “I’d love people to use social media to share the beautiful trees they’ve grown and start a conversation, one country to another.”Mentor Joanna DaiCatherine White – Sweet Chestnut Designs (Celtic‑inspired head jewellery)After working in the City and a stint as a truck driver, White longed for a more creative job. Studying silversmithing at Glasgow School of Art, she’d already had success selling “sparkly tiaras” but wanted to try something new. She came up with a Celtic bridal circlet, which a friend convinced her to put on eBay. “It sold straightaway,” says White. “That was 2012, and they haven’t stopped selling.” White is now looking for support with packaging and shipping. “I’d like to expand more into America,” she says.Mentor Joanna DaiLindsey Fairbairn – Ledro Design (inidually designed decals)Teaching assistant Fairbairn started her wall sticker business from her home in Chichester. “I was looking for something creative,” she says. “My degree is in design, and I love to craft things, so I came naturally to the idea.” Often personalised, her vinyl illustrations were an instant hit online. She hopes the scheme will help her find the support to scale the business. “I want to employ someone to manage the customer side of it, so I can concentrate on creating more products that’s where my passion lies.”Mentor Gabi CoxLuke Damian-Grint – Bone Shades (Bone-conducting smart sunglasses)Damian-Grint’s innovative glasses use Bluetooth technology to link your phone to a bone-conducting speaker, so users can take calls and use voice-command via vibrations through their skulls to the inner ear. Some similar products are sold in the US, but Bone Shades are unusual in that they run on Google systems, so the tech is always updating. Damian-Grint has started taking pre-orders and, with the scheme’s support, he eventually wants to expand into other products. “I’d like to build it into a technology fashion brand sold in major retailers globally.”Mentor Walter GleesonEmma Orr – Ambassadors of Science (slime kits and science experiments)Looking for a new way to engage her students, Orr decided to shake up her lessons. “I started running science workshops,” she says, “and created a slime kit.” These proved so popular she took the kits online, developing equipment for basic science experiments. Now, Orr has given up her teaching job to pursue her passion full-time. “All my time is spent on this,” she says. Orr hopes the scheme will help her expand as she develops a Halloween box and preps for the Christmas slime rush.Mentor Walter GleesonSimon Basil – Built by Basil (artisan gear knobs from recycled skateboards)Car gear knobs made from old skateboards might not sound like an obvious idea, but it’s certainly a popular one. A fan of Reddit, Basil shared a video of himself making the accessory on the site and, to his shock, it gained more than 400,000 views in a matter of hours. The orders soon started rolling in. “I sell to people who like customising their cars, which is a massive market,” says the former engineer from Lymington, but he’d love some support. “You can’t beat speaking to someone face to face and fleshing out a problem.”Mentors Mo Bro’sDavid Long – Babouche Golf (handmade personalised golf head covers)A trip to Marrakech inspired Long to create his range of golfing accessories. After commissioning a leather maker in the souks to produce a cover for him, he brought it back to his home course. “Everyone loved that it was nothing like the branded covers on the market,” he says. He now stocks 22 styles and sees eBay as the ideal platform for scaling up. “The scheme has given me the impetus to give this everything, because it’s not a side hustle, it’s my future.”Mentors Mo Bro’sEach of our Doers has been paired with an expert entrepreneur to offer advice and guide them through the scheme.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

We are projected to post a significant deficit this year without enough resource to cover the loss,” stated the letter, first published on the Guido Fawkes website. “Alongside structural problems we are facing competitors in student discounts, trading support and policy and strategic support. We have faced challenges to all three of these income streams but rarely to all three at the same time.“It’s important that we respond to this competition collectively and collaboratively as a movement, if we are to continue to protect the interests of students and students’ unions.“If we’re right and our income streams suffer as much as we predict we’re looking at a £3m deficit for the group in this and future financial years. Because there are not sufficient reserves to cover this amount we are taking urgent action to stabilise our position.”The NUS said in its statement: “The boards, officers and executive team are agreed that we need to deliver fundamental corporate, democratic and financial reform by summer 2019. This means there will be a range of proposals brought to a strategic conversation meeting in November 2018 for consideration and refinement with the help of our members, and subsequently to national conference 2019 to be voted on by our members.”Members were told that the union had taken advice on how to remain solvent in the short term. “It looks likely this will include a combination of borrowing against the building we own, making cuts to staff and turning off some of the activity we deliver. This will free up some cash but it will not address the underlying governance issues,” Martin and Robinson stated in the letter.The NUS group includes its commercial arms, such as NUS Services and the NUS’s student discount card, Totum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2115111a1601e6d85ed650cb2e96fa1a16abf8d1/0_340_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c727300dfb24e3027af862594f4abdb","title":"gdt european wildlife photographer of the year 2018 in pictures","story":"A hunting wolverine, rainbow lake and delicate ice trees are among the winning images selected by the Society of German Nature Photographers.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

But will it halt harassment on set?Introducing the recent series opener of India’s top-rated talk show, Koffee With Karan, the director-producer-personality Karan Johar championed Bollywood’s new-found “girl power”: 12 months of successes – such as the taut spy thriller Raazi and the raucous bridal comedy Veere di Wedding – that were led and authored by women. His guests, accordingly, were distaff royalty: reigning queen Deepika Padukone, newly radiant after surviving January’s trial-by-fire film Padmaavat, and beaming princess Alia Bhatt, Raazi’s immensely talented young lead. Reclined on Johar’s Nortonesque couch, Bhatt was offered a cuddly Sophie’s choice between her much-Instagrammed cats and beau Ranbir Kapoor Padukone raised a suggestive eyebrow after asked what she first notices in a man.If the show’s peppy tone was enjoyable, it felt strangely removed from the grim claims emerging on social media from women occupying the film industry’s lower ranks. India’s #MeToo movement – initiated in early October and gathering rapid pace online – cast a looming shadow over this week’s Jio MAMI Mumbai film festival, the event’s 20th. As creative director Smriti Kiran told me at the festival’s bustling Juhu hub: “#MeToo started to escalate two weeks before the festival, and we are one of India’s leading festivals, so everybody was looking at us. They wanted us to take responsibility. We wanted to take responsibility.”Sleeves were duly rolled up, red lines established. Two features and three shorts were struck from the programme after allegations were levelled against key creative personnel another feature, the critically admired Balekempa, was withdrawn by producers following an anonymous Facebook post that accused writer-director Ere Gowda of sexual assault. At last Thursday’s opening ceremony, set against the majesty of old Bombay’s towering Gateway to India, festival director Anupama Chopra apologised to “all the people we have disappointed” while hoping “that the decision we took, to stand with the women who have raised their voices, will lead to an environment that is constructive, inclusive and just”.Furthermore, the change in the schedule provided room for a run of female-driven films highlighting the renewed ersity and strength in non-mainstream Indian cinema. Leena Yadav’s Netflix-bound feature Rajma Chawal addressed a recognisable father-son generation gap Priya Ramasubban won hearts with Chuskit, featuring a young paraplegic adapting her wheelchair to her Himalayan home. And emergent Assamese talent Rima Das, whose Village Rockstars is India’s submission for next year’s foreign film Oscar, made two big splashes: first by toppling into a rooftop pool during the opening night party, then with her latest, Bulbul Can Sing, a hard-hitting take on shaming culture.For Kiran, the selection speaks to new ways of thinking: “We used to be a nation that only produced films about big ideas – poverty, dissent – and the focus would seldom be on the inidual, because it was always on the collective. As an Indian, I feel we place so much emphasis on the family unit that the inidual gets shafted, and it’s important to nurture the inidual if you want society to benefit.” Wider exposure to international cinema, rarely screened even in cosmopolitan Mumbai, may have played its part. Roughly 100 festivalgoers queued for five hours to see Palme d’Or-winner Shoplifters the prize for hardiness, though, surely goes to the fellow who queued for 10 hours for the dubious pleasure of experiencing Gaspar Noé’s Climax.Discussion remains to be had about the winds suddenly freshening India’s once-patrician film culture. The campaigning Delhi critic Anna MM Vetticad published a piece for the Quint warning of what might need addressing for greater parity – not least the whispered allegations about predations by several revered luminaries. Even Kiran admits #MeToo snuck up on her predominantly female team: “The movement started in the west way before ours did, and we didn’t think ours would start so soon. We thought it would take 20 more years. So when you think it’s going to take that long, you can imagine how far behind we must be.”The festival closes on 1 November with Steve McQueen’s Widows: more strong women, doing what has traditionally been a man’s job. Beyond that, confesses Kiran, a much-needed holiday beckons. Then, however, the work resumes: “We’re fighting for basic things: respect don’t pounce on me don’t ogle, it’s rude … The narrative around feminism, and wanting things, is to our extreme disadvantage. People turn around and say you hate men. I’m like, ‘No. Why? What is wrong with you?’ So I think, first things first, we need to get the basics right. Forget about big things happening. We’re not starting from ground zero. We’re six feet under. So let’s get to ground zero.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b87d6e273fe1cee448c70a0dc4fdb7ba1504d0a/1_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd8958c4c9fcbd8ea713da546ce3113a","title":"five english clubs named in super league plan chelsea manchester city united arsenal liverpool","story":"• Leak claims Chelsea among those seeking to create tournament• Real Madrid and Barcelona also involved, report Der SpiegelFive English clubs are among 11 so-called “founding members” in a proposal for a European Super League to start in 2021, according to documents released by Der Spiegel on Friday.The German magazine – as part of the latest Football Leaks revelations – claims Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are among the clubs who have been in negotiations about a new competition to replace the Champions League in three years’ time.A draft of a “binding term sheet” sent on 22 October 2018 by the firm Key Capital Partners to Real Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, appears to show the English clubs would be joined by Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Milan as founding members with a further five clubs – Atlético Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Marseille, Internazionale and Roma – appearing as “initial guests”.According to Der Spiegel, the 11 founding teams could not be relegated and would be part of the league for the first 20 years. The date by which the 16 clubs are to sign the “binding term sheet” is listed as November 2018.When contacted by journalists working on the leaks, Real Madrid and Key Capital Partners declined to comment on the document.Bayern, when asked for a comment, said the club was aware of “neither the existence nor the content” of the draft of the “binding term sheet.” Furthermore, he added, Bayern “as a matter of policy, does not comment on confidential discussions”.The 11 founding clubs, according to the document, would register a company in Spain to market, organise and execute the European Super League under its full control. The competition would have a group stage and a knockout round. There is also a suggestion that a second league under the European Super League could be created.Last year the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, accused Europe’s top leagues of attempting to “blackmail” the governing body and told leading clubs he would never allow the creation of a European super league. Ceferin accused “some leagues” of trying to hold Uefa to ransom and “some clubs” of agitating for a closed super league.“To some clubs, I shall say it calmly and dispassionately, but firmly and resolutely: there will be no closed league. Quite simply, that is not in line with our values and ideals,” he said in 2017.“We will never give in to the blackmail of those who think they can manipulate small leagues or impose their will on the associations because they think they are all powerful on account of the astronomical revenues they generate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7873a8304b52f1a5e42241219c8d075e2dcac426/0_8_1695_1017/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=725cdc99cf595483a6e5ace45179a2c4","title":"me and sister dont get on what can we do annalisa barbieri","story":"Try to work out what’s at the bottom of it, says Annalisa Barbieri, and start acting like adultsMy sister and I are in our late 20s and have never been close, while me and my mother being close is a source of friction. Recently, our relationship has turned from distant and tense to violent and now nonexistent.As teenagers we went in different directions. I flourished and worked towards my ambitions, got excellent grades, and praise from my parents. My sister seemed remote and uninterested. This seems to have continued.She has had success within her own field and enjoys a much more generous salary than I could ever achieve. I always congratulate her on her successes and ask about her life, yet it feels one-sided. She can frequently be hostile and belittling. I always try to be the bigger person, but am left hurt and angry, so I keep my distance.This came to a head when we both moved back in with our parents temporarily and had an argument that turned physical. Over the next week, she ignored everyone, then left.I felt she owed me and my parents an apology for the way she treated everyone. I couldn’t understand where all this hatred and anger had suddenly appeared from. But now, a few months later, my sister has got in touch with my father. Me and my mother feel betrayed. My father says he just wants everyone to get along, but has not confronted her about what happened.I can’t accept that he is willing to resume contact, and find myself retreating from my relationship with my dad, which I really value. It feels as if he is choosing her over me.Your father isn’t choosing her over you, any more than your mother is choosing you over her. It sounds like your family has never learned to be a group of four – there’s a lot of stratification. I don’t condone your sister’s violence – that was wrong – but you say in your longer letter that you shouted at her that “no one wanted her there”, which was also very wounding. There’s clearly an enormous amount of hurt in your family. You say you don’t know where this hatred and anger has suddenly appeared from, but it will have been festering for a long time.It isn’t obvious who is the eldest and who the youngest. I’m guessing there’s a very small age gap. It’s worth finding out what happened when child number two was born. Did the first born feel pushed out? Did the second born feel they had upset the family dynamic? Those early years can inform current behaviour patterns.Parents of young children can, often unconsciously, make or break sibling relationships. Siblings can, as the family psychotherapist I consulted, Dr Reenee Singh (aft.org.uk), said, “reflect what’s going on in the generation above”. In other words, with your parents, who don’t seem to be handling this in a very confident manner. Were they always like that?But how you and your sister get on now is your responsibility: you are adults, yet you are acting like young children. Your sister not asking anything about you is a classic way of one sibling rejecting the other. What you need to do is step away from the family dynamic and discover who you both are as adults – and see things from each other’s point of view.How do you move forward? You will have different narratives of your childhoods, and you will each need to allow the other to tell their side.“You may want to consider writing your sister a letter, owning your part in the argument and your own feelings,” Singh said. “You can explain how you feel without blaming. ‘I felt upset’ rather than ‘You upset me’. Apologise for your part in it.” Singh suggested it may also be worth looking at your parents’ own sibling relationships and the way they were parented – both can provide useful answers to your dynamic with your sister.“Of course, your parents should be able to have a relationship with both of you. The unit can’t just consist of you alone and your parents.”I got the feeling that’s what you really want, and you will need to dig deep to acknowledge why that might be.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

A white paper setting out the government’s plans for post-Brexit migration was expected to be published later this month, with the emphasis on attracting high-skilled workers.Rudd said on Friday she hoped “changes will be made” at the Home Office after a report found senior civil servants failed her at the height of the Windrush scandal.She stepped down in April after wrongly telling the home affairs select committee there were no targets for removing illegal immigrants.The report by the prime minister’s adviser on ministers’ interests, Sir Alex Allan, found officials repeatedly gave her the wrong information and failed to clear up the problem in time to allow her to correct the record when she appeared before MPs on 25 April.An executive summary of the report, published by the Home Office on Friday, criticised two senior officials for the way Rudd was told there were no targets, something put down to “crossed wires”, with other errors then meaning the mistake was missed.The officials, Hugh Ind, then the head of immigration enforcement, and Patsy Wilkinson, one of the Home Office’s top civil servants, have not faced any disciplinary action and have both moved to different government jobs.In the report, Allan criticised Ind for a “less than satisfactory performance” and said Wilkinson, as the manager of an exposed official, would have been expected to “play a more proactive role”.Rudd told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There are elements of this report which just show that, unfortunately, that area of the department did not have a grip on what was going on.I hope that there will be changes made as a result of this report so that people get a better service from immigration enforcement.”Rudd questioned why the report had been “sat on for nearly six months” and claimed she had been targeted by a series of leaks while she was home secretary. “There were a series of leaks during the past year at quite a high level that were definitely intended to embarrass me,” she said.Downing Street said May, who preceded Rudd as home secretary, accepted Allan’s findings. “Clearly, the report has raised some difficult and important issues, and the Home Office has rightly said that they’re going to learn from those,” May’s spokeswoman said.But she rejected any suggestion of concerted efforts by civil servants to undermine ministers. “It is about a specific set of circumstances involving a small number of iniduals,” the spokeswoman said. “There is nothing to suggest such issues are widespread across either the department or the civil service.”The PCS civil service union reacted angrily to the suggestion that officials should be held responsible. “It is galling how Amber Rudd cannot seem to take responsibility for the policies of the department she was in charge of as home secretary,” said Mark Serwotka, the PCS general secretary.“To attempt to shift blame on officials and overstretched, under-resourced Home Office staff for the mistakes during her time as home secretary is shocking. The hostile environment she oversaw and a culture of bullying and discrimination that was allowed to take place is to blame, not hard-working staff.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faaed71988f6065cc3cc5be9d83d267c52195a4f/0_88_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2999c0e3e2c3c1c9c470d93992436131","title":"david cameron does not want political comeback say friends","story":"Friends say ex-PM has been unhappy with speculation he wants to be foreign secretaryFriends of David Cameron have insisted he harbours no immediate ambition to return to frontline politics and has been displeased by speculation he would love to be foreign secretary in a future Conservative government.One said the former prime minister intended to “purposefully stay out of politics” for the foreseeable future – well beyond Brexit next spring – and that he was pursuing a portfolio career after “pretty much” completing his delayed memoir.The book is due out next autumn, a year later than planned, leaving Cameron to concentrate on a mixture of commercial and charitable work, including setting up a UK-China investment fund and a “blue belt” clean ocean initiative launched this week with the former US secretary of state John Kerry.But Cameron, according to the friend, remains “a believer in the idea of public service” should a suitable public role emerge in the future, although there is little sign that Theresa May would be accommodating.No 10 would only say on Friday that it was “up to him” if Cameron wanted to return to public life, giving no indication that it was a prospect that would be welcomed by his successor.The denials emerged a day after the Sun reported that Cameron was bored and fancied a return to the cabinet whenever a new leader succeeded May, prompting a torrent of criticism from former political opponents.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, tweeted: “No David please stay in retirement you caused enough damage last time.” Her fellow Labour MP Anna Turley said: “The sense of entitlement is unreal.”Cameron’s post-political career has so far seen him take a different direction to other key figures from the coalition period, who have landed lucrative jobs in the private sector after government.George Osborne, who was Cameron’s chancellor, is now the editor of the Evening Standard newspaper in London and has also taken on a lucrative advisory role with the US investment firm BlackRock, which in 2017 was paying him £650,000 a year for working one day a week.Last month it emerged the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg had been appointed head of global policy at Facebook, advising Mark Zuckerberg as the company deals with growing political scrutiny.Cameron is understood to still be distressed by Brexit, which followed his decision to hold the EU referendum, and by the current state of the Tories, where anti-EU MPs are arguably more powerful than ever.He is widely understood to support the “Norway for now” soft Brexit option, rejected emphatically by May but supported by a handful of former allies in parliament, such as Grantham and Stamford MP Nick Boles, a long-time friend of Cameron. It involves the UK remaining in the single market by staying in the European Economic Area. May and hard Brexiters claim it would leave Britain a rule-taker.Cameron has been paid £800,000 by Harper Collins for his memoir, which will tell the story of his life from childhood but with a focus on the period after he became Tory leader in 2005.He resigned as an MP in September 2016 saying he did not want his presence to become a distraction for May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9dffb157411ea29a48a5d1c4c74e3757e491177/0_143_2663_1598/master/2663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baab3d73f2969982b18b72c6c75b5e04","title":"majority in all labour seats back second referendum study says","story":"People’s Vote campaign polling contradicts perception that constituents want quick BrexitA majority of voters in all seats held by Labour support a second referendum on Brexit, according to an analysis released by the People’s Vote campaign as it steps up its lobbying of opposition MPs.The campaign commissioned a YouGov study based on polling of 26,000 people in the hope of persuading Labour MPs to vote for a second referendum if May’s Brexit deal is rejected and the party cannot force a general election.The effort is aimed in particular at Labour MPs in constituencies that supported leave, many of whom still say that the primary message they hear from constituents is they want the UK to get out of the European Union as fast as possible.“It’s no surprise to me that my constituents feel that they have been failed in the negotiations and are changing their mind on Brexit,” Phillips said. “If I had to pick who decided my fate between Theresa May or the people in my community I’d pick them every single time.”The support of Labour’s 257 MPs will be critical if a second referendum is to pass the House of Commons, and even now strategists at the People’s Vote campaign concede “there is not currently a majority in support of a People’s Vote at Westminster”.Their belief is that MPs would first have to vote down whatever deal May brought back from Brussels, before the idea of a second referendum to break the deadlock could gain traction. But the hope is that the research will give Labour MPs food for thought.Jeremy Corbyn’s party agreed a policy at its conference under which it would measure up May’s deal to see if it would protect jobs and workers’ rights. If the deal failed that test, Labour would vote against it when it was sent to the Commons for ratification after the prime minister concluded the orce talks with Brussels.Labour would then seek to force a general election by calling a confidence vote, and only if that failed would it consider the option of a second referendum, an idea that was enthusiastically championed at conference by the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer.YouGov used a multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) technique, polling 26,000 people to build up a statistical model of key demographics, including age, gender, education, race and social class. The theory is that it becomes possible to produce a model for every constituency in the country.Peter Kellner, a former president of YouGov, said that the MRP approach indicated a hung parliament in last year’s election. He added that his former employer’s data showed that “very few voters with strong views on Brexit – whether for or against – have changed their mind since the referendum”.Quieter members of the electorate – those “who do not necessarily speak to MPs on the doorstep” – were the ones who had changed their minds, Kellner added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a1c0b940930fdb03188e478b114e916f4c137da/0_27_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c703173be8c10e916d2618517fb2449","title":"uk and ireland signal irish border brexit deal could be agreed soon","story":"Senior politicians say recent progress in talks could resolve the backstop imbroglioThe British and Irish governments have signalled that a Brexit deal is very close after a flurry of official talks and visits on both sides of the Irish border, and a positive statement from the Democratic Unionist party after a separate meeting with the Brexit secretary.Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, and David Lidington, the UK Cabinet Office minister, said on Friday evening that recent progress in negotiations could resolve the backstop imbroglio and produce a deal this month.Their upbeat assessment came as Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, which props up the Tory government and has threatened to block Theresa May’s deal over the Irish border issue, also indicated a deal appeared close.Foster said: “Goodness, we have been here on a number of occasions and I think we are close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland, that is what we want.”Only two weeks ago, the party was threatening to vote against the budget and other domestic legislation if the Brexit deal did not reflect its position.Lidington said Downing Street would stand by commitments it has given on the Irish border and was committed to resolving final difficulties as quickly as possible, paving the way for an orderly withdrawal from the European Union.He was speaking to reporters after a joint meeting of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference which sought to kickstart talks on the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland.Coveney said negotiating teams had worked hard to allay British fears over the backstop, a device intended to avert a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in the absence of a Brexit deal.Neither side gave specific detail but Coveney hinted that the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was willing to accommodate certain British concerns,adding that London needed to show more flexibility.Informed sources, however, indicated that a deal over a customs-arrangement for the entire UK was a “live issue” which would assuage fears over a hard border.Ireland’s justice minister, Charlie Flanagan, and the UK’s Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, also attended the Dublin meeting.Foster spoke in Belfast after meeting the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, who earlier on Friday visited Warrenpoint Port to see the border for himself before meeting Northern Ireland parties at Stormont.The DUP leader said there was no need to return to the “border posts of the past” when the UK left the EU, but reiterated her party’s opposition to any arrangement which differentiated Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.“We want to see an exit from the EU that is sustainable … one that works for everyone in the UK and indeed one that works for our neighbours in the republic of Ireland as well,” she told the BBC.Nigel Dodds, the DUP’s leader in the House of Commons, who also attended the meeting, struck a harder tone in rejecting any new regulatory checks between the UK and Ireland.Dodds also raised a new issue over the European court of justice. “If Northern Ireland is subject to EU single market regulations, then it will also be subject to the ECJ in some form as the arbiter of those regulations. This position leaves Northern Ireland a rule taker from Brussels but also importantly it creates a democratic deficit on an important part of our economy – agriculture and manufacturing.”Raab reiterated that the government would not sign up to anything “that would threaten the economic, the constitutional, let alone the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom” but refused to rule out any new regulatory checks at the Irish border, suggesting a possible showdown between the government and the DUP. “We are engaged in a negotiation process,” he told reporters.Raab’s visit to Warrenpoint Port was the first of any UK minister to a Northern Irish port since the 2016 Brexit referendum.Warrenpoint is one of the five main sites of seabound exports and imports between Northern Ireland and Britain which, at low tide, is just a few hundred metres from the republic. “He was engaged and the most knowledgeable I have see on this roster of people we are meeting in relation to Brexit,” said one local business leader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0bba0255a23f70e93ffeb2d469b00e025685fb3/0_693_2718_1631/master/2718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3939fa69a5ae49053e08411501106c2","title":"turing lovelace or franklin your choices for the new 50 note","story":"Readers discuss the scientists they would like to see on a new £50 note after the Bank of England asked for nominationsAlan Turing seems a popular choice here and rightly so.

This new species has been named Lavocatisaurus agrioensis.“We found most of the cranial bones: the snout, the jaws, a lot of teeth, also the bones that define the eye sockets for example and, in that way, we were able to create an almost complete reconstruction,” said Jose Luis Carballido, a researcher at the Egidio Feruglio museum and the national council of scientific investigations.Parts of the neck, tail and back were also found.“Not only is this the discovery of a new species in an area where you wouldn’t expect to find fossils, but the skull is almost complete,” added Carballido.The remains belonged to an adult about 12 metres long, and two young of six to seven metres.The paleontologists say the dinosaurs moved around in a group and died together.“This discovery of an adult and two juveniles also signifies the first record of a group displacement among the rebbachisaurus dinosaurs,” said the study’s lead author Jose Ignacio Canudo of Zaragoza University.The area in which the fossils were found is unusual for dinosaurs as it would have been a desert with sporadic lakes in that era.Sauropods were the biggest creatures ever to walk the planet. It is believed that Supersaurus could reach up 33–34 metres in length and Argentinosaurus might have weighed up to 120 tonnes.They were herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails, massive bodies and small heads.But the discovery in the province of Neuquen, published in the scientific journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, remains a huge surprise.“While one can imagine that this group of sauropods could have adapted to move in more arid environments, with little vegetation, little humidity and little water, it’s an area in which you wouldn’t be looking for fossils,” said Carballido."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cb72583617329756a8d704f0d55126810af9c45/0_107_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0021712aca3dbfc0de3533dea0d934b","title":"brad shields england south africa test twickenham","story":"England’s flanker has never been to the venue where he makes a home debut against South Africa on SaturdayIt is a great piece of sporting trivia: name the England rugby international who has played at Wembley but has never visited Twickenham, until now, in his life?Brad Shields’s only previous Test caps both came in South Africa in June but exactly two years ago he could be found at the home of football, clad in the black and white hoops of the Barbarians as they drew 31-31 with the Springboks. Little did he guess, as a provincial player based in New Zealand, that he would one day face the same opponents in the white shirt of England. What a journey it has been for the 27-year-old.The bearded Kiwi-raised flanker may resemble a member of ZZ Top but his story also has echoes of ACDC: it is a long way to the top if you want to ruck and maul. As recently as last year he was turning out for the Hurricanes against the British \u0026amp Irish Lions and nursing faint hopes of becoming an All Black. To suggest his life has been turned upside down is an understatement.Forwards: Maro Itoje v Eben EtzebethItoje and his second-row partner George Kruis offer the only experience in England’s pack. Itoje needs to reproduce his club form for England against Etzebeth, who seems revitalised after an injury-ravaged year.Backs: Owen Farrell v Handré PollardAs he finally gets a shot at 10, Farrell will be hoping for a first win as a fly-half against the Boks. Pollard (pictured) is a solid defender and tactical kicker and has been the first choice under Rassie Erasmus.Overall record: England 14 wins, South Africa 25 (plus two draws)No one is more thrilled than his English-born parents, Nigel and Danielle, originally from Hull and Essex respectively, although Brad has encountered one or two culture shocks since arriving at Wasps this summer. There are not a whole heap of terraced houses in New Zealand and the concept of a washing machine in his kitchen – “I’m not used to washing the clothes next to where you do the dishes and cook the food” – has come as a surprise. There has been little sign, too, of the English silver teaspoons he recalls being proudly displayed on his grandmother’s wall, nor the chip butties his family used to enjoy on Sunday afternoons during his childhood years. “I’m still waiting for those chip butties but I’ve had a few bacon butties and baps so I’m there or thereabouts.”Rather more pressing is the need to hit the ground running against a formidable South African back five who will make no allowances for the emotion that will flood through him when he experiences the anthems at Twickenham for the first time. “It will be one of those days where there is a lot of emotion going through. It is perfectly normal to have a bit of feeling because it means you care. Twickenham is the sort of stadium everyone wants to tick off their bucket list. There will definitely be ‘pinch me’ moments but it is how you channel that to bring the best out of yourself. By the time the first whistle comes it is just about doing your role and the best for the team.”His years of service in Super Rugby, with its regular trips to South Africa, also mean he knows precisely what to expect from Saturday’s visitors. “It’s pretty obvious what they are going to bring. A massive thing for South Africans is their emotion and their brutality. They want to be the dominant forward pack. Even some of their big backs want to be that dominant force. If we can match or better that at the set-piece that will go a long way taking away some of their good play.”Alongside back-row colleagues Tom Curry and Mark Wilson, it will inevitably fall to Shields to make endless tackles and to haul himself back up off the floor even when his body is screaming for mercy. Now that the former Hurricane has ticked Wembley off his bucket list, Twickenham fulfilment is his next goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de4df617a409a50b2a25ac4f2140b7675ef595b/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b00b079b6b38f4edc2071bb4b3b5d4ff","title":"sandpaper saga in the bin as australia and south africa focus on the present","story":"One-day series could end up being more about bowling than batting, and Steyn’s return will make it a pace duel to enjoyIt’s inevitable that with South Africa visiting Australia’s shores in November, there would be questions about the ball-tampering episode from Cape Town the previous March. But in the end, it would be hard to find anyone who cares less than the South Africans.For one thing, they’re here for limited-overs cricket. There are only five players in the squad who played in that previous Test series: the captain Faf du Plessis, wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, opening batsman Aiden Markram and fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi.For another, they never thought the ball-tampering thing was that big a deal in the first place. Some people have implied that du Plessis is a hypocrite, given he’s been charged with tampering twice himself. But he was the first to point that out in Cape Town, saying openly that his team was in no position to criticise. He also stated that he thought the whole issue had been overblown, and sent Steve Smith a personal message of support following his suspension.If there were any residual ill-feelings from the likes of Rabada about the bad-tempered Test series, this is also a very different Australian line-up. The only players from the South Africa tour are the fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc, who weren’t much involved in on-field disputes, and Shaun Marsh, whose verbal tendencies make the average monk look chatty. The feuds of the past don’t need to be carried on by those in the present.Instead, it will be a new series and a new challenge for an Australian team that has struggled to find any mojo in either of the white-ball formats. The 50-over side endured a 5-0 thrashing in England in June. The T20 side lost a triangular tournament to Pakistan in Zimbabwe in July, and has just lost 3-0 to the same team in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). There is a 50-over World Cup next year, and nothing is clicking for Australia.Having the aforementioned bowling attack available on home pitches will certainly help, even if rotation policies mean they probably won’t all play together. Nathan Coulter-Nile is the other quick, who was impressive with bat as well as ball in the UAE. Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa make up the spin component.The big question is how the batting fits together. Glenn Maxwell, Chris Lynn and Travis Head are a dynamic trio, but there will presumably be room for only two of them. Aaron Finch and D’Arcy Short are the only regular openers. Marsh’s two centuries at first drop in England led coach Justin Langer to guarantee his spot. Marcus Stoinis has to be picked as the seam-bowling all-rounder at six. So that leaves two spots for the other three batsmen.Lynn and Short are the two that selectors are trying to nurture as 50-over players, having made recent teams mostly on their T20 exploits. Lynn has shown promise after top-scoring in the domestic 50-over competition in September, while Short is still working out how to change the pace of his game and what to do when he’s bogged down. If he struggles, Head could also return to opening the batting, which he’s done with some success before.As for South Africa, the return of Dale Steyn to assist Ngidi and Rabada will make this series a pace duel to enjoy. Steyn is 35 years old now but has had plenty of time out with injury in the last couple of years, which may just have freshened him up for a new tilt. AB de Villiers decided not to push on until the World Cup, but Steyn is determined to do so.The varied wrist spin of Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi will also be a challenge for Australian batting that has struggled against the middle overs of spin. But South Africa’s batting also looks a bit thin these days without the stalwarts like de Villiers and Hashim Amla in the order.Du Plessis will lead Markram, de Kock, and the powerful David Miller, but otherwise will be relying on the inexperienced Reeza Hendricks and some bits-and-pieces players such as Chris Morris and Farhaan Behardien.\u0026nbspIt should be a series about the bowling far more than the batting, but any batting performances of note might count for more because of that. With that World Cup looming, every game from here matters for the players hoping to make it. That will be the focus from both sides now, rather than any shared history about sandpaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b420a2bd3ed500b5186e0faeb58c2731390fa033/0_177_4683_2810/master/4683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17ee0869b1da554aed12d82785702357","title":"usain bolt experiment proves to be the fad it was from the outset","story":"The sprinter’s football dream is over – for now – and the benefits of the experiment are negligible In unveiling the news that eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt would be coming to Australia to pursue his dream of becoming a professional footballer, Central Coast Mariners CEO Shaun Mielekamp stressed the Jamaican would be treated the same as any other player.It was wishful thinking. Bolt’s entity is not just greater than that of the entire Mariners organisation, it is greater than the entire A-League. There was no entourage or ostentatiousness, but it did not take long to notice the leverage Bolt held in the partnership.It was partly the Mariners’ fault. Before the 32-year-old had even arrived in the country, Mielekamp ulged that a glut of potential sponsors had been on the phone and new members were being signed up off the back of the announcement.And slowly the club started to indulge him. First, there was the lightning bolt insignia mowed into the pitch at Central Coast Stadium, followed by the news he was headed to France for a sponsorship event that had been pre-arranged before he signed with the club. Then came the televised friendlies, fully equipped with “Bolt Cam” that followed the player’s movements and reactions even when he was sat on the bench. The ongoing reassurance that Bolt’s trial was “indefinite” also did little to suggest that Bolt was being treated like any other player.Despite this, time was always of the essence. This was a narrative the Mariners could not control. With the A-League season approaching and no friendly matches to test himself in for the foreseeable future, it was no surprise to see pressure ramped up on the Mariners to offer Bolt a professional contract.Such is the power of Bolt, the leak of an offer from Malta’s Valetta FC – and his subsequent rejection of it – was the only spark required to force the Mariners into action. Within a week, the club had offered him a professional contract, albeit for a vastly inferior sum to what he expected. They did so without alerting their coach, Mike Mulvey, who downplayed the possibility of Bolt being able to compete with the club’s existing options in attack.Bol was also caught off guard, despite assurances from Mielekamp that the Jamaican was “coming here for the right reasons” as there are other clubs “who offered millions more than he’d be able to earn on a contract with us”. Wishful thinking. The decision to stay away from team training while a deal was thrashed out signalled the experiment was coming to an end.The struggling A-League side were clearly overwhelmed by The Bolt Show and the effort to make the world’s fastest man an inconspicuous member of the squad was, again, wishful thinking.But the Mariners were not taken advantage of and the club said the experiment had been “mutually beneficial”. Mielekamp said the only regret he had was that “maximum potential wasn’t achieved”.Bolt will likely move on to another club – with the media circus again in hot pursuit – leaving the Mariners to consider the benefits of the past two months. But outside some short-term commercial rewards, his impact has been negligible.Bolt’s arrival was not a moment of progression for the club. It was instead the fad that many people thought it was going to be when he signed. And the Mariners, after having had their moment in the global spotlight, will now go back to being the Mariners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab4ffd9f3ec596028f99e402b002a7db5cc6027/0_203_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26528b365a99e6dfbc3613617326d9ce","title":"sportwatch all blacks v japan a league wnbl and more live","story":"40 min: Lovely stuff!

What he finds ‘frightening and debilitating’ now, though, is leaving the EUMark Gatiss is recalling an early memory, rocking back and forth on the sofa as he talks. It is an “extraordinarily vivid” moment from when he lived opposite a psychiatric hospital in County Durham. The institution was central to his childhood, a “colony” in which his mother and father worked, where he went to swim, to trampoline, to see films. Except, on this occasion, he was left on one of the wards with his brother to wait for his parents. “I must have been around five. There was a boy rocking on a bed. As I remember it, he had an empty eye socket. He had his thumb in it and he was just rocking – like this.”Gatiss takes his thumb to his eye and rocks some more. It is a baroque vision, creepy enough to make you squeal, and befitting for one of the creators of the stage show and TV series The League of Gentlemen. As Gatiss says: “You can’t get more northern gothic, can you?”It is clear he enjoys playing up the northern gothic. His Twitter tagline reads: “Actor. Writer. Strangler.” In person, there is no hint of gloom. He is sweet and sunny, an optimist by his own admission. Still, an unprosperous northern childhood and those years of observing mental illness – and the world’s responses to it – continue to serve him at the age of 52. He is currently in Nottingham, in rehearsals to play the titular lead in Alan Bennett’s 1991 play, The Madness of George III, at the Nottingham Playhouse. The play – which was adapted for a 1994 film, The Madness of King George, starring Helen Mirren and Nigel Hawthorne – dramatises the monarch’s mental illness.Since the TV version of the League – which followed the tormented outcasts and oddballs of the fictional town of Royston Vasey – landed in 1999 and earned Gatiss and his co-stars a legion of fans, he has helped to create some of the most popular shows on TV. These include the revived Doctor Who (as a writer and an actor) and Sherlock, a reimagining of Sherlock Holmes as a 21st-century detective, which he co-created with Steven Moffat and in which he stars as Holmes’s brother, Mycroft. In between, he has worked on films and written books and plays. His stint in Nottingham follows a nationwide tour of the League, an Oscar-tipped film (The Favourite) and The Dead Room, a yet-to-be-aired Christmas ghost story starring Simon Callow, which he wrote and directed. After The Madness of George III, he will team up with Moffat again for a BBCNetflix adaptation of the vampire classic Dracula. “I do work hard and I think that’s a good thing,” he says. “Work hard, be kind, that’s my motto.” Filming for Dracula will start next year, but Gatiss does not plan to act in it. He will not be drawn on who will be cast as the vampire, but says he and Moffat thought carefully before deciding to set the series in its original period, the 19th century: “We said when we started Sherlock that we briefly got custodianship of the keys to Baker Street and we felt: ‘It’s our go.’ So, we wanted to have ‘our go’ at Dracula and with that we wanted to do all the treats – a big, spooky castle and the rest of it.”Sherlock was set in the modern day for the opposite reason: “We felt it had become so swamped with Victoriana that people had lost sight of what it was – which is essentially a flat-share story of two unlikely friends, one of whom solves crimes. That was the really exciting thing, to just go back to basics.” While the series has been a runaway success, there have been criticisms: one  article lamented that his Sherlock was morphing into James Bond it vexed Gatiss so much that he sent the  a rejoinder in rhyme, outlining the differences between his hero and Ian Fleming’s.There have been other charges of “unfaithfulness” in Gatiss’s adaptations, but he is adamant about his right to play with an original story. “I feel very strongly about not just drearily reproducing the book. You are duty-bound to think: ‘Here’s an idea, why don’t we flip this round,’ especially if people know it well. It doesn’t spoil the original. No one burns the manuscript … the Tardis would never have left the junkyard in the 1960s if it wasn’t about change.”And what greater change than a female doctor? The new series is the first with which Gatiss has not been involved since Doctor Who relaunched in 2005. How does he feel about Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor? “First, it’s lovely that I’m enjoying watching it on a Sunday night and not knowing anything about it. I have even tried to avoid the trailer for the next time. And I have said for a very long time that there should be female Doctors. As soon as you watch it, you say: ‘Of course, why not?’ All you need, ever, is for the right person to be playing the part. Jodie is instantly likable, funny, delightfully odd.”If that is the case, can we – should we – stop at Doctor Who or extend a gender-blind, colour-blind policy to all period dramas? It depends how literal we want to be, Gatiss says, but he balks at the prospect of a female Bond. “Doctor Who is an alien with two hearts who lives in a dimensionally transcendental phone box and can periodically change his or her appearance. James Bond is a man. There’s no way out of that. It becomes a very reductive argument. If you want to create a really kickass new heroine or hero, then do something else.”If you were to create a female Bond, he adds, would you then follow Fleming’s blueprint of making her a sexist lothario? “What is it about James Bond you want to change? Is it just the sex or is it everything else? In which case, you’ve got a different character anyway.”Gatiss was not long out of studying theatre arts at Bretton Hall College in West Yorkshire when he co-wrote the League with Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, whom he met there. It has been a long, loyal partnership, even though they went their separate ways – and thrived – before returning after 13 years to take the show back on the road. “We never fell out, we just stopped doing it,” Gatiss says. “We had been doing it virtually day in, day out for 11 years. So, we decided to do other stuff. The extraordinary thing about the tour was that it felt like no time had passed, which is what great friendships are about.”The League began as a stage sketch show in 1994, when standup was more dominant in comedy. Gatiss and the others were enlisted to fill a slot at a fringe festival. “We did it for five nights and it went down really well. I remember a friend of mine saying: ‘You should do something with this.’” They did – and won the Perrier award at the Edinburgh fringe in 1997. “We did what made us laugh. All the things we loved ranged from proper horror to the horror of embarrassment Alan Bennett, Victoria Wood, Mike Leigh. It was very much about our northern upbringings, too – we were identifying our own experiences of the world of the north. It was real anger and despair and oddness.”It is not just the rising intolerance of the “immigrant” outsider that he fears, but also the erosion of other liberal, humanist values. As a gay man – he is married to the actor Ian Hallard – he has never felt personally threatened in London, where he lives, “but you go out of London and it’s very different. You go to certain parts of the country and you think: ‘I would modify my behaviour here.’”The regions around his birthplace were the heartland for leave voters, but Gatiss is proud to have grown up in the north and in a working-class household: his father was the chief engineer at the psychiatric hospital and his mother was a carer and secretary. “I think my background did me an awful lot of good. There’s a very good line from Doctor Who: ‘Never lose sight of your horizons.’ There’s nothing wrong with coming from one place and moving to another place, but it’s good to know that and honour it. And also to acknowledge its flaws – it doesn’t have to be perfect.”Brexit upsets him immensely. He speaks of it in irate exclamations and bloody analogies: “Brexit, to me, is like slitting your own throat and going to bed saying: ‘I’ll see how I am in the morning.’ I’m a sickeningly optimistic person and that’s what worries me about how depressed I am about it all. The temptation is to totally disengage because it’s so frightening and debilitating, but if you do that they’ve won.”The Madness of George III is at Nottingham Playhouse until 24 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3ebb58abd2788408c16d38439d1bb080e9c62/390_0_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee5ad4ea0e8de1d6b91edff41dfa3f5","title":"darcey bussell strictly steps back in time in pictures","story":"In her new book, Evolved, the Strictly judge and former Royal Ballet star gives an intimate account of her career, alongside photographs of her rehearsals, performances and fashion shoots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcc93b69f02e07c620bd8d2ec0c79aa0630e2be/0_129_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b40f7acde6a096bb7bf063307d9ac0","title":"today in focus takes you behind the guardians headlines podcasts of the week","story":"’s new daily show aims to tell the paper’s stories in a fresh and engaging way.

Campaigners had planned to protest during her appearance.“This is an important victory for anti-racists,” said Kate Douglas from the Oxford branch of the Stand Up To Racism campaign group, which was behind the planned protest. It said the cancellation “shows that anti-racists can make a difference if they organise and mobilise”.Weidel was due to give a speech to the Oxford Union next Wednesday before facing questions, rather than participate in a full debate. Kristina Kämpfer, a University of Oxford PhD student, co-authored an open letter calling for the event to be cancelled or for its format to be changed in order to subject Weidel to more “comprehensive scrutiny”.She said: “I fully support the value of free speech but I think the union needs to be aware of the quagmire that’s caused by inviting people like Alice Weidel.” Kämpfer added that the institution had placed itself in the position where it was forced to choose between handing a platform to the far right or denying it one and allowing Weidel to present herself as a victim.The Oxford Union said: “Alice Weidel has cancelled her planned trip to the UK next week due to concerns with the security arrangements for aspects of her travels and engagements. We regret to inform members that she will therefore not be speaking at the Oxford Union.”The institution’s president did not respond when asked what specific security concerns had been raised and whether they had been passed to the police. Weidel and AfD failed to respond to a request for comment and questions on the same topic.Thames Valley police confirmed it had been working with the Oxford Union on security for the event but was unable to say on Friday evening whether or not it had received any specific complaints or information about security threats.AfD has made major political inroads since its formation in 2013, becoming the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag. It has capitalised on some Germans’ fears over the recent arrivals of refugees and other people from mainly Muslim countries.There were reports that Weidel had written that Germany was being “overrun by culturally alien peoples such as Arabs, Sinti and Roma”. She reportedly blamed that on the government being in thrall to the allied nations that won the second world war “whose task it is to keep down the German people”. Weidel denied writing the email, which the newspaper Welt am Sonntag said predated her membership of the party.AfD has been heavily criticised because of senior members’ links to rightwing extremists, after they marched alongside members of the Pegida group in September. In response to previous criticism, AfD has said it is a “democratic party which stands up for the constitutional state. The AfD fights against extremists who abuse authorised protests in order to advertise their anti-democratic world view”.Weyman Bennett, the joint secretary of Unite Against Fascism, said the far right was on the rise globally. “Far right and fascists seek the prestige of institutions like the Oxford Union to legitimise their racist views. Wherever racism is given credibility, it emboldens racists to launch attacks, as was the case in the horrific murder of 11 Jews at their synagogue in Pittsburgh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93a20dcf0a45aa8a578b9b4f743d6858dd7b961a/0_130_4947_2969/master/4947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68c00fe827524f1798d57fd7bd95641b","title":"iran sanctions us european humanitarian supplies","story":"British, French and German ambassadors jointly tried to persuade US to outline how humanitarian supplies could be guaranteedEuropean governments have so far failed to persuade the Trump administration to guarantee Iranian imports of basic foods and medicine after the imposition of blanket sanctions next week, according to diplomats familiar with the negotiations.The sanctions – on oil, shipping and banking, lifted after Iran agreed to strict curbs on its nuclear programme in 2015 – are to be reimposed on Monday six months after Donald Trump walked out of the nuclear deal, with more than 700 new banks, companies, iniduals and vessels being added to existing blacklists.Humanitarian supplies are officially exempted from sanctions, but in the past risk-averse foreign banks and companies have avoided all transactions with Iran for fear of being penalised, leading to severe shortages of life-saving medicines and food staples in the years preceding the 2015 agreement.“There’s no doubt that the lives of thousands of patients will be at risk,” Ahmad Ghavideh, of Iran’s haemophilia society told the  by phone from Tehran.“Any delay in supply of medicine, particularly in the sector I work in, will have catastrophic consequences,” said the head of the NGO. “My worry is not for today, but in six months’ time when our supply runs out. They claim that the imports of medicines are exempted from sanctions but in practice, because of banking restrictions, we don’t have access to medicine or ingredients needed to make them internally.”The UK, French and German ambassadors to the US – the three countries are co-signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal – made joint visits to the treasury and state departments in September in an effort to persuade the administration to produce a “white list”. This would give clear guidelines about what channels European banks and companies should follow to conduct legitimate transactions with Iran without fear of future penalties.“We are expecting our American friends to make some gestures on humanitarian goods,” Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to Washington said this week. “Of course humanitarian goods are not sanctioned. But the fact is the banks are so terrified of sanctions that they don’t want to do anything with Iran. It means that in a few months, there is a strong risk that there will be shortage of medicine in Iran if we don’t do something positive.”Araud said it was not enough to exempt humanitarian goods from the list of sanctions. “You really need to be more positive and to say how to do it. If you don’t say how to do it, the banks will not do it. So we are waiting for a technical answer,” the ambassador said at the Hudson Institute think tank.Asked about the administration’s response, Araud said: “As for humanitarian issues we have not actually received an answer.”“The whole idea of a white list is frowned on by the administration,” another European diplomat said.On Friday, the state department’s special envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, who met the European ambassadors in September, appeared to rule out making special provisions for humanitarian goods, beyond formally exempting them from sanctions.“The burden is not on the United States to identify the safe channels,” Hook told reporters. “ We have done our part to permit the sale of humanitarian goods to Iran. That is our part. That is our role. Iran has a role to make these transactions possible. Banks do not have confidence in Iran’s banking system … That’s Iran’s problem it is not our problem.”The three European parties to the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), strongly oppose the Trump administration’s decision to violate it and are seeking to insulate European companies doing business with Iran from US sanctions by the creation of a “special purpose vehicle” that would provide a channel for trade in euros.The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, issued a joint statement with the British, French and German foreign ministers on Friday saying they “deeply regret” the reimposition of US sanctions and would continue working on ways of keeping legitimate trade with Iran going.“Our collective resolve to complete this work is unwavering,” the statement added.Briefing journalists about the coming sanctions, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he did not think the European effort to bypass US sanctions would work.“I have no expectation that there will be any transactions that are significant that go through a special purpose vehicle based upon what I’ve seen,” Mnuchin said. “But if there are transactions that have the intent of evading our sanctions, we will aggressively pursue our remedies.”European diplomats say there is a debate going on within the administration on the issue of humanitarian supplies, with some officials in the state department warning that the US risked being blamed for Iranian civilian deaths if more is not done to guarantee deliveries of medicines and basic necessities.They said the hardest line came from the White House, which relished the pressure it was putting on Iran. On Friday, Trump tweeted a photograph of himself in the style of an advertisement for the Game of Thrones fantasy TV series, with the tagline: “Sanctions Are Coming, November 5”.Although the administration is not officially pursuing regime change in Iran, one European diplomat said that is ultimately the aim of the national security adviser, John Bolton.“Bolton believes the regime will collapse,” the diplomat said. “So the discussion we try to have with this administration is what happens after, and it has never led anywhere so far.”Trump explored the possibility of holding a secret meeting with the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN general assembly in 2017, but Rouhani rebuffed the proposal. The US president is said to be no longer interested in talks, believing that economic isolation will force Tehran into concessions without the need for negotiations.Ellie Geranmayeh, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations said: “The administration has told the Europeans: we are not going to go the extra mile in reassuring European companies on this front.“I have spoken to a number of European pharmaceutical companies and they say their banks have flagged they are going to struggle to deal with any payments from Iran,” Geranmayeh added. “This is not consistent with the Trump administration’s declared policy that sanctions are not against the Iranian people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd02f0b69e9dc6ccc29ba65d0a2747ecabc08718/0_0_1886_1132/master/1886.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95ea3802006b17e267f462a25ac82b11","title":"plan create worlds biggest nature reserve antarctic rejected","story":"Environmental groups say Russia, China and Norway played part in rejecting planA plan to turn a huge tract of pristine Antarctic ocean into the world’s biggest sanctuary has been rejected, throwing the future of one of the Earth’s most important ecosystems into doubt.Environmental groups said Russia, China and Norway had played a part in blocking the proposal, with the other 22 members of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the organisation set up to protect Antarctic waters, backing the proposal.The 1.8m sq km reserve – five times the size of Germany – would have banned all fishing in a vast area of the Weddell Sea and parts of the Antarctic peninsula, safeguarding species including penguins, killer whales, leopard seals and blue whales.Experts said it would also have played a key role in tackling climate change, as the seas around the Antarctic soak up huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. But following days of talks in Hobart in Tasmania, the CCAMLR rejected the plan, which needed unanimous agreement to pass.Environmental groups, who had mobilised 2 million people in support of the plan, reacted with dismay.“This was an historic opportunity to create the largest protected area on earth in the Antarctic: safeguarding wildlife, tackling climate change and improving the health of our global oceans,” said Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace’s Protect the Antarctic campaign.“Twenty-two delegations came here to negotiate in good faith but, instead, serious scientific proposals for urgent marine protection were derailed by interventions which barely engaged with the science.”She said that rather than put forward “reasoned opposition on scientific grounds, some delegations, like China and Russia, instead deployed delaying tactics such as wrecking amendments and filibustering, which meant there was barely any time left for real discussion about protecting Antarctic waters”.The UK government backed the plan, with an Foreign Office delegation present for the talks in Hobart, Tasmania. Minister Alan Duncan said: “It is not in our gift to do this unilaterally. It is subject to an international treaty which requires wider agreement with other countries. At CCAMLR, these proposals were rejected due to objections from others.”He said the British government would continue to press for the creation of ocean sanctuaries in the Antarctic in the years ahead.Last month, the UN warned there were only 12 years left to prevent climate catastrophe.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, had told the  he was “fully behind” the creation of the Antarctic sanctuary, which he said would be a key moment in the effort to protecting the world’s oceans.She said that although the scientific evidence was clear, “diplomatic efforts seem to be more concerned with expanding fisheries than with conservation”.She said that meant it was more urgent than ever for the public to join the fight and put pressure on politicians to safe the oceans before it was too late, adding: “If bodies like the Antarctic Ocean Commission continue to fail in their mandate to conserve the ocean, they’re clearly unfit for purpose and aren’t part of the solution. Instead we must look to the historic negotiations taking place at the UN towards a Global Ocean Treaty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f86617624785d439c2d978b376c0cde406742d/245_257_4929_2956/master/4929.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2839d05d24c85d3f272205b100632c9","title":"china is committing ethnic cleansing in xinjiang its time for the world to stand up","story":"Beijing needs to be held to account. On Tuesday, a UN meeting provides other nations with that chance Now is the time to act on China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang. China’s efforts to destroy the ethnic Uighur identity through mass internment camps and militarised surveillance must be raised loudly and clearly condemned during a UN human rights review of China on Tuesday in Geneva.Countries afraid of standing up to China on their own can speak out on 6 November on a UN platform, known as the universal periodic review (UPR), where all countries equally take turns to be scrutinised by their peers about every four years. The UPR tests UN member states’ commitment to promoting and protecting human rights, but more pragmatically, it gives governments a shield to protect themselves when speaking up.These countries are at less risk of China angrily cutting economic or political ties if they criticise its policies in Xinjiang as a part of a UN process. As peers, their opinion carries more weight with the Chinese government than the NGOs, journalists, and academics who have been sounding the alarm for months. A clear, collective voice from dozens of countries at this critical juncture in China’s crackdown on Xinjiang could make the Chinese government pause and rethink its approach.So far, governments have been slow to react to the human rights disaster in China’s far western Xinjiang region. Its sheer scale demands immediate international action. An estimated one million Uighurs and other Muslims minorities are believed to be held in extra-legal detention centres in Xinjiang because of their ethno-religious identity, with torture and ill-treatment rife in the camps. Authorities in partnership with tech companies have developed and deployed dystopian surveillance technologies to turn the rest of Xinjiang into an open-air prison.Step-by-step the Xi Jinping regime has crossed thresholds unthinkable years ago, with little repercussion. The government detained nearly every single human rights lawyer over a single weekend in July 2015, imprisoned China’s only Nobel peace prize laureate until he died in custody in July 2017, and earlier this year, abolished presidential terms limits, paving the way for Xi to become dictator for life. The Han-dominated Chinese Communist party is now confident that the only way to govern Xinjiang is to eradicate the distinct Uighur identity in the name of countering terrorism. This cannot continue.It’s no coincidence that China’s crackdown on Xinjiang comes as Xi is promoting his signature trade policy, the Belt and Road Initiative, which relies on Xinjiang as a core land route. Countries expecting to benefit from increased development along the route should be aware of the potentially destabilising effects of China’s crackdown in the region.Under Xi, China has shed the foreign policy constraints dictated by former leaders and deliberately stepped forward to play a leading role in global affairs. A responsible, rules-based stakeholder would be welcome to play a prominent role in international governance, but the Chinese government is intent on changing the rules to suit its brand of rule by one-party iron fist.However, as China tries to step into this leadership role, it is still susceptible to public opinion and international criticism. That is why the government felt compelled to launch a propaganda campaign in recent weeks, abruptly changing its tactic of denying the existence of re-education camps to rebranding them as “humane” job training centres. But the Chinese government must never be allowed to normalise mass extrajudicial internment of an ethnic minority. Governments need to push back and seize the unique moment the UPR offers to make a stand.The goal of the UPR is ultimately to improve the human rights situation in all countries. For that to actually happen, powerful countries need to be held accountable. Tuesday’s meeting provides an opportunity to shine the spotlight on Xinjiang and collectively tell China enough is enough. UN member states taking part, especially those along the Belt and Road path and Muslim nations, should all inidually raise Xinjiang and make clear, unequivocal calls for China to end its abusive policies. The Chinese government needs to hear from its peers that it cannot commit ethnic cleansing.What’s happening to Uighurs and Muslim minorities in Xinjiang is about the future of China and the wider world. Some of the policies and technologies used in Xinjiang won’t stay there. They’ll spread east across China and eventually find their way overseas.Frances Eve is a researcher with the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Casey\u0026rsquos comments verbalised what people think, says those close to the communityMary Robinson says Travellers were demonised during presidential campaignUK\u0026rsquos Brexit secretary stops short of ruling out customs checks conducted in Irish SeaParty leader says increase in D\u0026aacuteil seats from six to double digits \u0026lsquoabsolutely achievable\u0026rsquoSite will include shopping centre, office space, a hotel totalling 90,000 square metresHead of British Academy speaks of concerns for humanities, social sciences and movement of researchersPetition had called for ICGP to hold meeting to discuss provision of abortion servicesFour students propose renewable energy solution for the agricultural sectorSimon Coveney and David Lidington at British-Irish Intergovernmental ConferenceJonathan Keogh, Thomas Fox and Regina Keogh convicted of killing in north Dublin in 2016Con Cunningham (83) carried out \u0026lsquoa grievous breach of trust\u0026rsquo, judge saysMichael Wall (40) gets three-year suspended sentence after sale of brooch at Sotheby\u0026rsquosLifeng Han\u0026rsquos behaviour could be explained by \u0026lsquocultural differences\u0026rsquo, court toldMargaret Glennon (49) who went missing in 1995 and James Gallagher (18) who went missing in 1999 now identifiedFather-of-seven said it was a \u0026lsquomoment of madness\u0026rsquo over previous altercation between childrenTechniques now routinely available are more precise, easier to deploy, quicker in getting results, and less expensiveCervical cancer campaigner was offered palliative chemotherapy but decided on new drugHigh Court told woman, in her eighties, will vigorously oppose allegation at criminal trialStep-brother (54) was teenager during time of assault on victim then aged 6 to 8 years"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684717.1541205196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey outlines political ambitions somewhat incoherently","story":"Outlining his political ambitions, Mr Casey said he still aspired to the office of the Taoiseach but whether he would make it there by 2020 was “hard to say”.The businessman and former television “Dragon” who caused consternation with his remarks on the Travelling community, said he was not intent on leaving the political stage but had difficulty setting out a concise strategy for his next campaign.Although this approach appeared lost on his audience, Mr Casey said he would be targeting seats in Monaghan, Limerick, Clare and Kerry, where he secured support for his presidential bid. He also did not rule out starting his own political party.In an often uncomfortable interview, Mr Casey was confronted by members of the Travelling community in the studio audience who criticised his position on their right to a distinct ethnic status. In response, he said discrimination was abhorrent to him and that “I have nothing to apologise for”.He appeared to accept an invitation to visit Pavee Point, the centre representing the Travelling community. However, he stood by his earlier comments that their community could be accommodated in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.“I made a suggestion that there is plenty of room in the Phoenix Park. If Travellers wanted to, why not give them . . . there’s 1,100 plus acres there, there’s loads of room, you could make it a beautiful place for them to stay,” he said, adding that they could go for five years and “get education”.“Have you any self-awareness at all,” asked someone in the audience.Earlier on the same programme, former president Mary Robinson said a tendency to “demonise the other” had flared up during the Irish presidential election campaign.She had been asked her views on the surge in popularity of Mr Casey following his remarks on Travellers.“And I think that can flare up as it seems to have done in this election. I think it happens and it happens with populism.”Ms Robinson said she had not followed the election very closely but was glad to see Michael D Higgins returned to office for another term, saying that while he had initially said he would not run he seemed to have found he had more to offer in the role.During her appearance last night, she addressed a wide range of political subjects, remarking on how US president Donald Trump was a bully whom she had not met and had no particular wish to.However, she said as the newly appointed chair of the Elders – an international organisation of public figures noted as elder states people – she would meet with the US president.“And I would shake his hand and I would try to reason with him. But I would be very sceptical about the whole basis of that reasoning,” she said. “What I see of where he’s at and just how preoccupied he is about himself. It’s all about him. Even when he goes to funerals even when he goes to commiserate with people, it’s about how they treated him. Come on.”Ms Robinson also addressed climate change, noting Ireland’s need for policies in the area and confirming her newly acquired status as a pescatarian.On that note, she mentioned the recent move by Bord na Móna to lay off hundreds of employees, a move she said was right but that would disrupt the lives of many in the midlands. “We have time to have a better, safer, healthier, renewable energy future. And I admire Bord na Móna for taking a tough decision,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684516.1541188255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu and british very close to reaching deal on irish border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste \u0026 Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Simon Coveney with UK minister for the cabinet office, David Lidington. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe European Union and the British government are “very close” to reaching a deal on the Irish border that will pave the way for a Brexit withdrawal agreement, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Theresa May’s de facto deputy prime minister have said.Mr Coveney and David Lidington, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said a Brexit withdrawal agreement was “very close”.The pair were speaking after a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Dublin which was also attended by Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley.The Tánaiste said he believes a Brexit deal can be concluded by mid-November, the provisional date for a special summit of the European Council to sign off a withdrawal agreement.Mr Coveney said a lot of progress had been made in recent week, but added: “We are not quite there yet.”He said some further movement was needed on the UK side to find a legal wording on the backstop that can be “sold on both sides of the Irish sea”.The backstop – the guarantee that no matter how future trade talks between the EU an UK go there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland – is the main obstacle remaining to an exit deal.Sources said Mr Coveney and Mr Lidington will speak by phone over the weekend and there has been speculation in British political circles that Mrs May could present a final deal to her cabinet as soon as Tuesday.However, Mr Lidington refused to be drawn on this.London has rejected the EU’s interpretation of the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland effectively within the European single market and customs union. This would mean checks on goods between the North and Britain.Mrs May’s government has proposed that the UK as a whole would remain in the customs union for a period after Brexit. This would remove the need for customs checks between the North and Britain, though regulatory checks in areas such as animal health and food safety would still be needed.The EU had been willing to discuss this, but had so far insisted that it could only be finalised after the UK leaves the EU, as the future shape of the relationship between the two sides is fleshed out.Reports this week have suggested that the EU may now be prepared to go further and may include some outline details of the proposed EU-UK customs union in the formal withdrawal agreement.Sources suggest that Mrs May now has to make the political leap to conclude a deal.Mr Coveney said Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, “has shown the capacity to try to produce new thinking and new ideas to try to accommodate, where possible, British concerns”.He said the issue of the Border has been complicated by Mrs May’s position that the UK is leaving the European single market and customs union.“I think we are very close to resolving it, I certainly hope we are,” the Tánaiste said.Mr Lidington said there has been “movement on both sides” in the last few weeks.“We certainly, as Simon says, (are) very close to resolving it,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Nick BradshawLabour leader Brendan Howlin expects there will be a general election in the first half of next year and said he would not be entering into any pre-election pacts with other parties.“We obviously are facing a general election sometime in the coming months, my own judgment on it is that it will be sooner than the European or local elections, which we know are scheduled for May of next year,” he told reporters ahead of the start of the party’s annual conference in Dublin on Friday.Mr Howlin said his party would be campaigning “on a very clear Labour party policy platform” and that representatives would be setting out the party’s “red-line issues” during the weekend conference.“The bottom line is our focus this weekend is on policy formation. We’re not in the business of simply brokering deals, we’re in the business of advancing policies,” he said.Mr Howlin said the party was preparing 23 candidates selected to challenge for Dáil seats as well as 43 others seeking election to local authorities. He said there were other areas throughout the country where candidates were yet to be selected.“The bottom line is we want to ensure we maximise our vote. We also want to make sure as many people as possible are given the opportunity to vote for a Labour candidate,” he said.Following the State’s economic collapse and the EU-IMF bailout, Labour won 37 seats in the 2011 general election and entered a coalition government with Fine Gael. The party took much criticism for budgetary decisions made during the following five years and won only seven seats in the 2016 general election.Mr Howlin said Labour “of course” had an expectation of how many Dáil seat it could win and that he believed “we will be in double digits after the next election and I think that’s absolutely achievable and will be achieved”.About 1,000 party members and supporters are set to attend the party’s 70th annual conference.In his opening remarks to delegates, Mr Howlin asked members “who would have any confidence in this Government” given “what have they delivered”.He said the minority Fine Gael administration had inherited an economy “that was well on its way to recovery” but seemed not to know “how to use the opportunity they have been given to make the necessary changes to improve people’s lives”.“They are conservative in every sense of the word,” he added.Mr Howlin used his speech to criticise Minister for Transport Shane Ross and Peter Casey, who finished second to former Labour TD Michael D Higgins in the presidential election.Mr Howlin said “it’s all the more difficult to travel across Ireland” with Mr Ross as Minister for Transport and that his claim he had nothing to do with the proposed BusConnects plan for Dublin was “just one example of how the current Government is a shambles”.Meanwhile, he said Mr Higgins ran a campaign in contrast to Mr Casey’s “Trump tactics”. He said the business man had been “grabbing headlines by picking what vulnerable group to bully next”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684623.1541189688!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord %C3%A1ras openness michael d and seven more years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t President Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina after last weekend’s result was announced. Photograph: Tom HonanSo the dogs have the paws under the presidential table again and the sitting tenants have the lease renewed for another seven years. No doubt the messages of goodwill were flying through the letterbox at Áras an Uachtaráin, but we won’t be told about them because the Áras rarely discloses anything about what goes on behind the hall door.It has always been thus, but maybe our re-elected First Citizen will make good on his campaign promise to introduce more transparency where the working of the office is concerned. It’s was already overdue well before his time. And not just on the expenses front.Because it is already in the public domain, we know that the European Commission wished Michael D Higgins all the best, sending warm congratulation on his second term and wishing him “every success for the years ahead”.Commission president Jean Claude Juncker sent a nice letter. “Your understanding of the power of words to hurt or heal and to empower or ide is the mark of a true statesman. Your commitment to equality and sustainability as the guiding principles of your mandate will help to ensure a positive future for your country” he wrote. “I have very fond memories of our conversation in June and I look forward to your continued support and friendship.”The letter was dispatched on Monday, the same day that reporters in Brussels were wondering if the commission would be sending its congratulations to another new president, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.But, of course. A spokeswoman confirmed that Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk would sign a congratulatory letter to the far-right politician who has been dubbed the “Tropical Trump”.It would, however, be somewhat different in tone to the one which winged its way to Áras an Uachtaráin. “We respect the democratic choices made by the Brazilian people. Brazil is a democratic country with solid, strong institutions,” she said. “And we expect all future presidents to continue to work to consolidate democracy for the greater good of the Brazilian people.”No mention of fond memories, though.Former Greek foreign minister Yanis Varoufakis was delighted with the Irish result. “The people of Ireland are exceedingly lucky to have Michael D Higgins as their President. He is the nearest we have to a philosopher-president, combining remarkable erudition with the realistic humanism progressive politics so desperately needs today” he tweeted.But what did Vincent Browne think? Varoufakis knew the answer, retweeting Vincenzo’s tweet a few days before the election.“What is surprising in this Presidential campaign is not that Michael D has such overwhelming support, but that ANYBODY would indicate support for the Dragon windbags. There is NOBODY in Ireland better suited to be President for the next seven years than Michael D.”Lots of world leaders sent messages to the Brazilian president. It’s what they do. They don’t tend to keep these things a secret. We’re not sure our international friends ignored Micheal D Higgins or sent him lavish congratulations because the Áras is unable to disclose whether he got any such communications from fellow world figures.According to an Áras spokesman, these would be “private messages”. Maybe nobody wrote or called. Maybe he was snubbed by the likes of Macron and Merkel and Trudeau. Maybe Trump sent his good wishes to the people of Iceland. Maybe Putin sent a puppy. Who knows? But they tell us Downing Street sent a tweet. Tell us something we don’t know. Normal service has resumed at the Áras.The Minister for Justice was happy on three counts on Thursday. He snuck out of the department and took a half-day off. His youngest daughter Sophie graduated from the Dublin Business School with first-class honours in social science. And it was his birthday.The graduation ceremony took place in the RDS and Charlie Flanagan look every inch the proud Dad. Then it was back to Iveagh House for Friday’s British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. Nice photo, though.Louth TD Peter Fitzpatrick, late of Fine Gael, was on his local radio station during the week talking about the new Garda Commissioner’s recent appearance before the Dáil’s justice committee.Michael Reade of LMFM asked why Fitzpatrick didn’t take the chance to ask Commissioner Drew Harris, who is a former deputy chief constable of the PSNI, what he knows about the IRA murder of sheep farmer Tom Oliver in 1991.Fitzpatrick has been vocal in his calls on Sinn Féin to come forward with information about the crime. Six years ago, the new Commissioner gave evidence in closed session to the Smithwick Tribunal, naming a member of the IRA army council who ordering the killing.Reade asked Fitzpatrick why he didn’t ask Harris what he knows about the crime? “This is the head of the police force in this country who says he knows who killed a local man.”When the TD replied he didn’t get the chance, he was reminded he spoke for about 25 minutes. “You asked about cameras on uniforms and different issues and there was no rush on you, you had a lot of time and a lot of opportunity and for whatever opportunity you didn’t ask about Tom Oliver.”The TD, who left Fine Gael over the abortion issue and is now going to run as an Independent in the next election, got a little flustered by Reade’s tough line of questioning. At this point, listeners who may not have been paying attention to this interview on a very serious subject might have pricked up their ears.“I will definitely get Drew Barrymore to come down to county Louth and to meet the Oliver family,” declared Peter.Perhaps Peter had been watching ET the night before. Or Charlie’s Angels.Although judging by that howler, it was probably Scream.Labour’s Brendan Howlin stopped on his way to his party’s national conference on Friday morning to collect a possible successor to his leadership. The chosen one certainly possessed the one trait which Labour Party leaders seem to possess in abundance – prickliness.In recent memory, they have all been rather thin-skinned. Precious and prickly, although some more than others. Dick Spring set the bar high and those who followed did their best to emulate him. The pretender to Howlin’s throne had to be put in a crate for everyone’s safety.Surprisingly, it wasn’t Alan Kelly. That’s not to mean this won’t happen to him before the conference is over. Brendan collected a hedgehog. It ambled into a Labour councillor’s house in Wexford during the week looking for a nice place to see out the winter.Cllr George Lawlor took care of the seriously underweight hedgehog which wasn’t strong enough to hibernate and needed to be fattened up. Once it was ready to travel, party leader Howlin was enlisted to help in re-homing the prickly critter. He took it in his car to Hedgehog Rescue in Rush, via Leinster House, in a cat carrier.We understand the animal made strenuous efforts to escape when it entered the car park, thinking that it had reached the perfect hibernation destination. To be fair, the Dáil was in recess all week. Brendan successfully delivered his charge to the sanctuary, along with five boxes of kitten food as a donation towards the upkeep of the residents.Peter Casey missed a trick during his election campaign when talking about his dismal effort at winning a Seanad seat two years ago. He only got 14 votes. Actually, he didn’t. He got 14,000 votes. This is because one vote in a Seanad election is worth 1,000 votes for counting purposes. This is because the electorate is very small but the list of candidates for each panel is relatively large.As the PR system is used, it is mathematically easier to allocate seats with each vote puffed up by the power of 1,000. This can be misleading for people who are unaware of the fiendishly complicated method used to elect our senators. It also gives a nice ego boost to members of the upper house who can look at the completed data and imagine that they powered to their seats with tens of thousands of votes when they only got 30 or so first preferences.While Casey continues to get an inordinate amount of media attention and is loving every bit of it, Sinn Féin would rather forget the presidential election. However, party leader Mary Lou McDonald showed she has a sense of humour when she showed up during the early stages of the count wearing a scarf festooned in poppies.Her candidate, Liadh Ní Riada, who performed below party expectations, came in for stick from colleagues when she intimated in an interview that she would be prepared to wear the poppy emblem if elected president. Either that, or Mary Lou got dressed in the dark.Either way, she ditched the poppies by the afternoon and appeared before the cameras wearing a plain red scarf. It’ll all be forgotten before long. A president has been elected and the short ersion of the campaign is over. People will quickly go back to worrying about more important things.But in seven years time, do we really want a repeat of the shenanigans of 2018? Anybody not connected to a political party but with aspirations to a stint in the Phoenix Park should start work on their campaign now. And the television and radio head-honchos should sit down and work out a better way of holding presidential debates.They didn’t work this year. Six people in a studio, all expected to talk about other candidates’ policies and other candidates’ visions, generated some heat but very little light. Perhaps next time out, inidual interviews should be considered before descending to the traditional free-for-all. Standing at a lectern reading out clichéd syrupy soundbites is also pointless, unless it involves a drinking game where you have to take a swig at the mention of words like “pillars” and “conversation” and “share” and “inclusiveness”.And anybody who is ambitious for Ireland or passionate about our shared belonging should be ruled out immediately."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684650.1541191595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stacey abrams hopes to make history in state with oppressive legacy","story":"Republican Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams squared off over voter suppression during the first televised debate (October 23rd) in the Georgia governor election. Video: C-Span\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams with Oprah Winfrey at the Cobb Civic Centre in Marietta, Georgia. Photograph: Jessica McGowanGetty The rain was torrential but the atmosphere was electric. In an empty parking lot on the outskirts of Macon, a town about 130km south of Atlanta, crowds gathered on Friday to catch a glimpse of the woman who is seeking to become the next governor of Georgia.As 44-year-old former state representative Stacey Abrams stepped off her campaign bus in the pouring rain, veteran congressman John Lewis introduced the woman who many see as one of the Democrats’ big hopes in the midterm elections.Lewis, a giant of the civil rights movement in the 1960s who has represented Georgia’s fifth congressional district for more than 30 years in Washington, hushed the crowd.“I’ve seen unbelievable change in this state and all across the south,” he said, “but we have an opportunity to change things more than ever before. We’ve got to go to the polls and vote like you’ve never voted before.”As the cheers erupted, Abrams came to the microphone. In steady, confident, tones, the person who hopes to be the first female African-American governor in the history of the United States told her story.She recounted the tale, one that is likely to enter political folklore if she wins the gubernatorial race next Tuesday, about her first visit to the governor’s mansion.She had been invited to meet the governor after she was named high school valedictorian – typically the student who achieves the highest grades in class.But when she got to the gates with her parents after arriving by public transport, the security guard refused them entry. “He doesn’t ask for our names, he looks at my parents and he looks at me and he says, ‘this is a private event. You don’t belong here’,” she recounts. After her parents intervened, he eventually reconsidered.“I’m telling you this story because I don’t remember meeting the governor of Georgia,” she says. “I went inside that building but I couldn’t tell you what I ate, who I met inside . . . You see all I remember about that day was a man standing in front of the most powerful place in Georgia looking at me and telling me I don’t belong . . . But with Macon Bib county standing behind me on November 6th, we are going to open those gates wide in the state of Georgia, we are going to open those gates wide,” she says, to roars of approval.Although 36 governors’ races are on the ballot next Tuesday, nowhere are the stakes higher than in Georgia, where Abrams is hoping to make history. A victory would be particularly significant in Georgia – a state with a terrible legacy of slavery and segregation stretching back to the cotton plantations of the early 19th century.Over the last two days, Oprah Winfrey has canvassed door-to-door with Abrams in greater Atlanta, while Barack Obama was due to appear with Abrams on Friday night.Polls show that the race is neck and neck. A Fox 5 poll on Wednesday put Abrams slightly ahead at 48.1 per cent compared to 47.1 per cent. But under the Georgia electoral system, candidates must reach a 50 per cent threshold or else face a run-off, which could push a final result into December. Further, there are concerns that the Libertarian candidate on the ballot, Ted Metz, could take votes from the other two candidates, depriving both of a majority.In a sign of Republican concern, the party has been pouring resources into the state in recent days.As Oprah soaked up the limelight on Thursday, vice-president Mike Pence was campaigning for Abrams’s opponent, Brian Kemp, in Augusta and Savannah, lambasting Abrams for tapping celebrity endorsements.Donald Trump will also make a campaign stop here in Macon on Sunday, a last-minute announcement that forced Kemp to cancel the final televised debate between the candidates.Nonetheless, despite the energy around Abrams and changing demographics, Georgia remains a fairly reliable red state.Georgia has not voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since Bill Clinton carried the state in 1992, with Trump beating Hillary Clinton by about 5 per cent. Like many urban areas across the country, the state’s main cities, such as Atlanta, Savannah and Augusta, tend to vote Democrat.Abrams’s supporters are also concerned about voter turnout.The gubernatorial race has been tense. Abrams has accused Kemp of trying to suppress the minority vote by putting thousands of voter registrations on hold in his role as secretary of state for Georgia, a position he has held since 2010. \u0026nbspKemp says he is simply trying to prevent voter fraud. He is unapologetically pro-Trump, a stance that Republicans hope will motivate voters in this conservative state.\u0026nbsp“I’m Brian Kemp. If you want a politically incorrect conservative, that’s me,” he says in one of his campaign ads.Republicans have tried to paint Abrams as a radical, reminding voters that she once helped burn the state flag – then dominated by the Confederate symbol – on the steps of the state Capitol.But Abrams has presented herself as a bipartisan moderate who during her seven years as the minority leader in the state legislature worked with Republicans, sometimes to the chagrin of her own Democratic colleagues.Here in Macon, Abrams highlights healthcare and education as some of her main priorities if she wins on Tuesday. She talks about her background growing up in Mississippi and her five siblings, which include a federal judge, an anthropology professor and an evolutionary biologist.But it is her brother Walter, who suffers from schizophrenia and drug addiction and has been in and out of prison, who truly motivates her, she says. “Walter is just one of thousands of Walters wandering the streets of Georgia, and if we don’t know a Walter, we might be a Walter,” she says, as she describes how the health system has failed him.Finally, she calls on everyone in the district to get out and vote on Tuesday. \u0026nbsp“We need every ballot in the box so that we fill them to the rafters, so there is no question that voter suppression worked . . . This is our election,” she says to applause. “Amen,” shouts one elderly man, holding his “Abrams for Governor” sign, with tears in his eyes.Will there be a backlash against Trump?

Photograph: Joaquin Sarmiento AFPFor years he was one of the top tailors in the left-wing Farc guerrilla group: carrying his sewing machine through Colombia’s jungles on the back of a donkey, he was the man who kept the Caribbean fronts dressed and battle-ready. “They would say, we need 600 uniforms. Or a thousand tents,” says Diosenel Criado, who during his time with the rebels went by the alias Omar. “Camouflage was hard to get, but someone would smuggle it through. I would sew with my gun hanging right beside me.”  – logistics were everything. Always on the run, outnumbered and outgunned, the rebels needed to be sure their food, clothing and camps were good. Criado spent more than a decade with the rebels, whose acronym once stood for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, sewing their rucksacks, army fatigues, tents. But a peace deal signed with the government at the end of 2016 saw 7,000 armed rebel soldiers give up their guns and move into reintegration camps. Criado was among them. He brought that sewing machine – which he had kept for all those years – and is now setting up a peacetime sewing venture in a remote part of northern Colombia. Although camps like this one in Pondores, La Guajira, were meant to be temporary, many of the rank-and-file soldiers who came here to hand over their weapons have decided to stay on. Today, it’s home to some 200 former combatants trying to figure out what a life in peacetime might look like for them. In the middle of the day, the heat is unbearable, the atmosphere lethargic. A series of prefabricated houses lines a dusty footpath. There are shared bathrooms and tiny stoves in each house. One woman who spent 40 years in the guerrilla movement tells us they suffocate sleeping inside at night and that they are all putting on weight from the transition from mountain warfare to civilian life. Since the fighting stopped, many ex-combatants have been studying, choosing to finish their high school programmes or take professional training courses. They receive a basic budget from the government to cover their needs. But the biggest question for most is how long they will be able to stay here and what they are going to do next . Some want to work in tourism, others hope to farm. But such projects face roadblocks, with either uncertain tenancy on the land or questions over how they will be supported in endeavours entirely new to them. Walk into Criado’s workshop and everything seems cool, calm and orderly. It’s the only place in the camp with air conditioning. UN-donated sewing machines line the desks, thread and fabric are spread neatly over the tables. He cuts the cloth using the cardboard models he was given by a government training agency his female guerrilla recruits chat quietly as they sew nearby. “I wanted to start this project from the moment we came here,” says Criado (49), who found out he had become a grandfather after the war. “This food, this money the government gives us, it is not going to last forever. And when this ends? We need a way to live.” The team works hard on its new projects. The clothes are smart and precisely made: sweatsuits, dress shirts and domestic worker uniforms. The problem is that Criado does not have any sizable orders. The biggest one he has had to date was to dress a team of ex-combatants at a nearby farm. He travels the region trying to make contacts, chasing up promises of further orders, but business is slow. “People have said ‘we will bear you in mind’,” says Criado.The success of Colombia’s peace deal – which ended the longest-running war in the hemisphere – will live or die on whether ex-Farc rebels can find a way to make a living away from the violence. But experts say this less glamorous part of the demobilisation and reintegration process has not received the attention it needs.The government in Bogota remains at war with another left-wing group, the ELN, and is battling drug-trafficking mafia groups that could easily soak up those with a background in insurgency and a sense of disenfranchisement with the peace deal. “Colombia has a lot of organised-crime groups and guerrilla dissident groups, and they’re hiring,” says Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, adding that finding work in the normal jobs market may be tricky for ex-combatants from a group many Colombians considered a mere terrorist group. “Business owners worry that iniduals who spent years on the other side of the law will not be ethical employees,” he says. The United Nations has expressed concern over “shortcomings” in the reintegration measures currently in place, with a recent memo from the in-country verification mission warning that “today, more than ever, renewed government support for productive reintegration is essential”. Colombia’s newly elected president Ivan Duque has promised to do more, but as he was a sceptic of the peace deal while on the campaign trail there have been questions over how far his commitment to some parts of the deal will go. Back in Pondores, that leaves this group of ex-combatants wondering what their future holds. Many say that those who have lived through war do not want to go back. But they also say that they need more help. “We want to go forward with the peace process. The world needs to know that we are committed. But for reintegration we need to have a project,” says Franklin Ruiz, an ex-combatant who wears civilian clothes and a Farc baseball cap. “We came from the jungle, a clandestine life, we come here and it’s another world,” he says. “I was in the guerrillas for 40 years. It’s not easy for us to change.” *This article was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting "},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

The works to upgrade the ageing system will affect services on major lines including the West Coast, Great Western, Great Eastern, the Midland Main Line and the main route into Merseyside.Network Rail has defended the works, saying the £148 million it is spending over the Christmas period will lead to a more reliable and efficient service for passengers.It added that Christmas was the best time to carry out the work because passenger numbers across the network were usually 50 per cent lower than normal.Affected lines and servicesHowever, the scale of the work is likely to cause mayhem for millions of travellers trying to reach friends and family, The Times reported last night.Heathrow and Gatwick, the two busiest airports in Britain, will be closed to rail travellers or face significantly reduced services for periods of the Christmas break, while new track at Heathrow will mean no trains will travel between the airport and Paddington from Dec 23 until Boxing Day.The Great Western Railway to the South West will also be affected by the works, while work at London Victoria station will mean no Gatwick Express services to the airport from Sunday, Dec 23, until New Year’s Day. Passengers will be required to travel from London Bridge instead.Darren Shirley, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: “All passengers should benefit from the improvements to the railways being made over the Christmas break, which should cut disruption and delays in the longer term. It will be frustrating for people travelling over Christmas that their plans will be altered. They should make alternative arrangements for their Christmas getaways now.” Trains on the West Coast Main Line, including those operated by Virgin Trains, London Northwestern, London Overground and the Caledonian Sleeper, will be affected by work at Euston from Christmas Eve to Dec 30.Trains to Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield will all be affected.The Great Eastern Main Line which serves Essex, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk, will also be hit by work outside London Liverpool Street.A spokesperson for Network Rail, said: “Taking on and delivering these huge transformational schemes at this time of year minimises our impact on passengers who, so research shows, understand the need for such activity . . . We strongly advise passengers to plan ahead.”Plans for world\u0026#39s largest ocean sanctuary in Antarctic blockedTrump says \u0026#39I think we\u0026#39ll make a deal with China\u0026#39 on tradeThree dead after shooter opens fire in Florida yoga studioNew homes should be \u0026#39beautiful\u0026#39, Government adviser says as he warns skyscrapers are \u0026#39mutilating\u0026#39 skylineBoy stabbed at tube station in London\u0026#39s second teenage knife death in 24 hoursPrince Charles to lead restoration of seven historic buildings for his 70th birthday\u0026#39Low-level\u0026#39 paedophiles could avoid jail terms under new guidanceRising success of IVF has caused a collapse in adoption, says head of organisation for children in careBBC scraps Radio 4 religious programme Something Understood due to budget cutsOfcom halts BBC iPlayer expansion and calls for public interest testAmber Rudd aims for Cabinet return after being \u0026#39exonerated\u0026#39 on WindrushBoss of taxpayer-funded green charity sees pay soar 50pc to £232,000Donald Trump said black people were \u0026#39too stupid\u0026#39 to vote for him, his former lawyer Michael Cohen claimsWhite poppy sales soar, as MP criticises \u0026#39disingenuous\u0026#39 trendTate Modern tells neighbours complaining that visitors stare into their flats: \u0026#39Put up some curtains\u0026#39Gwyneth Paltrow aims to \u0026#39rebrand\u0026#39 menopauseChristian woman cleared of blasphemy barred from leaving PakistanLocal Labour branch rejects motion condemning the Pittsburgh synagogue massacreOprah joins campaign trail for Democrat candidate We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/11/02/TELEMMGLPICT000179693991_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"prince charles lead restoration seven historic buildings 70th","story":"Prince of Wales at Dumfries House, which he helped to save for the nation in 2007The Prince of Wales is to help preserve seven historic sites in honour of his 70th birthday, as his charity sets to work on “high impact” projects to regenerate communities across the country.The Prince’s Foundation, where the Prince serves as founding president, has announced it is seeking seven key sites to preserve buildings and traditional skills, following int he footsteps of Dumfries House.The Scottish house, saved for the nation by the Prince in 2007 and now a training centre for a new generation of craftsmen and women, will serve as a model for the project nicknamed “7 For 70” ahead of the Prince’s birthday on November 14.Today, the Foundation announces four of the seven successful...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

provide a near-infinite supply of resources for humanity.Commercially viable asteroids include those containing minerals like gold, silver and platinum, which could be mined and transported back to Earth.\u0026nbspIn 2015, the US government recognised this potential by legalising asteroid mining and moving\u0026nbspaway from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that banned it.The acquisition of Planetary

US government on the international legal dimensions of outer space.Ethereum smart contract functionality is a natural solution for private-ordering and commerce in space – the only domain of human

The then Tesco boss had just collected the Management Today Most Admired Company and Most Admired Company Leader awards. He was the king of retail, responsible for propelling Tesco to dominance. I asked Leahy what was the pivotal moment, when Tesco began to defeat the competition? He said it was when employees were ordered to think only Tesco, they could no longer refer to something Sainsbury’s, the market leader, had done and how they could ape it. From now on, it was just Tesco. The policy led to the Tesco Clubcard, Tesco  and other innovations, and, after a while, to Tesco’s hegemony. I was thinking of this in relation to Jack’s, Tesco’s new discount chain. Perhaps I am missing something but I cannot see the logic for it. Jack’s is a distraction, a gimmick, one that will not make any difference to Tesco profits and may even end up eroding them. Jack’s: Everything we know so far about Tesco’s new discount storeTesco’s new discount chain Jack’s will be ‘cheapest in town’ Tesco\u0027s Jack\u0027s has a silly name but it\u0027s a better bet than Asbury\u0027s Jamie Oliver is the new face of TescoLet’s believe, however, that Tesco, which went downhill towards the end of the Leahy reign, endured a slump, and is now being revitalised under Dave Lewis, really does see Jack’s as vital to its future prosperity. If so, they appear to have forgotten the Leahy lesson.Jack’s is clearly an attempt to follow the German discounters, Aldi and Lidl. But what Lewis and his cohorts have created is confusing. It’s called Jack’s, in deference to Tesco founder\u0026nbspSir Jack Cohen. He was a great “pile it high, sell it cheap” operator, so for a Tesco budget label, that makes sense. However, in a clear slug at the Germans and their sourcing, Jack’s boasts that “8 out of 10 products are British”\u0026nbspand as backup, there are Union Jacks everywhere. Presumably, based on research showing that some consumers aren’t thrilled with Germanic produce, Tesco has decided to strike a blow for Britain. But that does not make sense, either, because more than enough shoppers are completely content with Aldi and Lidl’s wares. The effect in a Jack’s is to feel like a declaration of war, with Aldi and Lidl firmly installed as the enemy. From the off, Tesco is fighting on someone else’s terms, not its own. And that goes against the Leahy doctrine. Then there’s the size. Tesco is aiming to have 12 stores by Christmas. That equates to a couple of hundred thousand square feet versus a total UK footprint for Tesco of 35 million square feet. Jack’s is a blip on Tesco, so small as to be immaterial. That’s the number of Jack’s stores Tesco is aiming to open eventually, according to reportsEven if Jack’s reached 90 outlets, thought to be the masterplan, that would be insignificant against Tesco’s 3,000. Why bother? Why ert so much effort and management attention on something that does not matter? Being so tiny brings with it another problem. It’s not worth suppliers having a dedicated production line for a mere 12 stores. So Jack’s own-label goods must be Tesco own-label repackaged as Jack’s. Not only does that open up the prospect of cannibalisation, as shoppers who would otherwise purchase the Tesco item buy the same one more cheaply at Jack’s, but the Jack’s margin is being drastically slashed. \u0026nbspNow comes the appliance-of-science bit. Anyone who supposes Aldi and Lidl just push out stock at low prices is wrong. There is calculation in every single thing they do.A fascinating article by advertising planning guru John Lowery (he’s advised Lidl among many others) sheds much light on how they operate. Lowery toured the first Jack’s, at Chatteris, with ex-Lidl boss, Ronny Gottschlich. First they meet iced doughnuts – hundreds, if not thousands, of them. How many can the people of Chatteris eat? But there are no plain and chocolate doughnuts. They’re out of stock. As are the ready meals, but, says Ronny, “The fridge is on. They’re wasting electricity.” Gottschlich produces his ruler and measures the shelf depth. There’s 94mm at the back that is empty, doing nothing. That translates into redundant metal, and cost. All over the store there is Jack’s own label. “That means they can’t get as close to mimicking the brands that they’re trying to gain sales from.” Out comes the stopwatch. It takes an assistant 11.2 seconds to rip off the lid of the box of cooked ham. In Lidl, the perforations are deeper and the packaging\u0026nbspcomes away more easily, in a maximum of 5.3 seconds. Which means the worker can get on with another task. Same with the bleach bottles. In Jack’s, the labels all face the front. Someone has arranged them like that, but such decorative precision takes time. In Lidl, they’re not, “Because it’s a waste of man-hours. The shoppers know it’s bleach. You could be doing something else… like manning the tills.” There are two sizes of\u0026nbsptrollies. “Why? It increases costs.”Gottschlich discovers that four out of five staff at the Jack’s previously worked in a Tesco. “There you go. They’ve learned to turn the packs round at Tesco. It will take months to knock that kind of behaviour out of them.”In obsessing about Aldi and Lidl, in creating Jack’s, Tesco is ceasing to be Tesco. And forgetting the instruction of its former brilliant chief.Chris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational communications advisory firmShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When Margaret Thatcher more or less put an end to council house building in the 1980s a great deal of their stock of homes was transferred to housing associations to be managed and maintained. Housing associations have also been able to access grants from government to increase their supply of new homes. But the volumes of new homes they have built each have never matched those built by councils in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because the government grants have never been large enough to enable them to do it. Their grants were cut severely by George Osborne and David Cameron. In recent months Theresa May’s government has been saying that they will get more resources. But this revelation that some of their grants will be erted to councils to build will come as another blow to the sector and may undermine trust in ministers’ promises.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said the news was “concerning”.“If lifting the cap on council borrowing comes at the expense of housing association delivery, that would be concerning,” said\u0026nbspJames Prestwich, the NHF’s\u0026nbsphead of policy.\u0026nbsp“However, we’re confident that more council building shouldn’t have to mean housing associations will build fewer homes. This isn’t a zero-sum game, and there is a lot to be gained from cooperation between housing associations and local government.”“Ministers should reset funding for low-cost homes to the £4bn it was in 2010, as Labour has long argued. This scale of investment could see both housing associations and councils building genuinely affordable homes at scale again,” said shadow housing secretary John Healey.Government figures show that between 2015 and March 2017 the AHP distributed just over £1bn of funding to create 42,878 affordable rent and affordable home ownership homes in England.The government says a total of £9.1bn in capital grants is available under the current AHP\u0026nbspover the next three years. Ms May announced a further £2bn of funding for the AHP in September, but this is reportedly\u0026nbspto be money for the next phase of the programme, which doesn’t begin until 2022.Councils were significant house builders between the 1940s and the 1970s. Margaret Thatcher brought that to an end in the 1980s and transferred much of the stock of council housing to be managed and maintained by housing associations.The latest official data shows the housing association sector started construction on 23,890 new homes in the three months to June, with annual new starts of all new homes running at 160,020.Ministers have said that they want to deliver 300,000 new homes a year in England.More than a\u0026nbspmillion households\u0026nbsphave been on social housing waiting lists for at least a decade.In her forward to a green paper on social housing in August, Ms May said: “We need to get back to the scale of new social housing that will deliver a real difference to communities.”An HMT\u0026nbspspokesperson said: “We’re committed to increasing the housing supply by 300,000 homes a year on average. Removing the cap on how much councils can borrow to build houses is vital to ensuring there is a variety of homes available. Councils are likely to use their own land and resources for development, which is why we do not expect the removal of the cap to affect other types of development.”Dan Wilson Craw of the Generation Rent pressure group said: “Lifting the cap on councils’ borrowing is just one part of the strategy we need to boost the building of social housing. Providing more grant funding is another, as it pays for itself in the long run in lower housing benefit payments.”Josh Ryan-Collins of UCL’s Institute of Innovation and Public Purpose, said the biggest obstacle for the provision of new council housing was the land market.“Ongoing austerity means local authorities still face strong incentives to sell off their land – or what’s left of it following years of privatisation – \u0026nbspto fund vital services rather than use it to build affordable housing. The land market remains rigged in favour of private developers given the rules around selling land at market value. Lifting the local authority borrowing cap is the first step in the other direction, but it’s a small step given the wider context.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

His company was criticised\u0026nbspfor shifting its tax residence from the UK to Switzerland in 2010, before moving back six years later. \u0026nbspMr Ratcliffe has said he would invest £600m to begin output of his new off-roader from 2020-21, saying he would prefer to build in Britain despite cheaper alternatives in countries such as Germany where the workforce is already trained and Ineos could use existing sites.“We’d have to build new in the UK so to balance that playing field, because you’re talking about hundreds of millions to build a facility... it does need some government support,” he said when the plans were first announced in 2017.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if even Star Wars can flop,\u0026nbspMarvel could certainly begin to lose steam. Here\u0027s a few cards it can play to stop that happeningClick to followThe Independent‘s Of The Galaxy’ was a huge commercial hit – but can it last?Bad luck superhero haters: there’s another of Marvel’s\u0026nbspcostumed crusaders at\u0026nbspyour\u0026nbsplocal multiplex\u0026nbspin the form of Venom.\u0026nbspThe hype machine is also moving into high gear for Captain Marvel, even though that’s not\u0026nbspscheduled to drop until March. There have been contradictory reports about whether Venom, starring Tom Hardy, is going to be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe (MFCU) or not.\u0026nbspSony holds the rights to Spider-Man and several linked characters, but struck a complicated deal with Marvel Studios, and ultimate owner Disney, to bring the web slinger into the MCU, which resulted in the wildly successful Spider-Man: Homecoming\u0026nbspat $880m\u0026nbsp(£685m) global gross. A sequel is due next year.\u0026nbspBut, depending on the box office, Venom could become part of a separate Sony Marvel universe. It would likely major on anti-heroes, which might be a lot of fun. Much depends on the film’s gross.Jake Gyllenhaal to play the villain in Spider-Man sequelBefore we look at the future, it’s worth reflecting on just what a remarkable creation MCU is from both a financial, but also a critical, perspective. Marvel Studios has put out 20 interlinked films so far, featuring seven inidual characters and one team (s of the Galaxy), which it has then brought together in three Avengers movies (four if you count Captain America: Civil War) with the fourth (and final?) outing due next year. What’s more, it has done it with mostly “B”\u0026nbspcharacters.\u0026nbspThe comic book publisher’s prior practice had been to licence its top properties to others. This is how Sony got Spider-Man, and Venom, and 21st Century Fox got the X-Men suite of characters, and the Fantastic Four.\u0026nbspDespite this, not since Captain America, back in 2011, has an MCU film failed to gross more than $500m globally. Six have broken the $1bn barrier and Avengers: Infinity War raked in twice that.\u0026nbspCritics sometimes grouse about the popularity of superhero movies, and the stranglehold they hold over multiplex screen space and the global box office, but they’ve been remarkably kind to the MCU’s output when it comes to their reviews.\u0026nbspAll its movies have been certified fresh by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with scores ranging from 66 per cent (Thor: The Dark World) to 97 per cent (Black Panther), an achievement unmatched by any other major franchise.\u0026nbspIf you find Tomatoes’ binary “freshrotten” system too simplistic, how about Metacritic? It puts together a weighted average of critics’ reviews to create a “Metascore”, and also separates films into five bands (two red, one amber, two green).\u0026nbspAll but three of Marvel’s films boast a green, “generally favourable”\u0026nbspor better rating, with Black Panther’s 88 again at the top (indicating “universal acclaim”).\u0026nbspIt just wouldn’t do to have the Best Film Oscar going to a superhero flick, so the Academy has created a gong for “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film”. It’s already been dubbed the Black Panther award.\u0026nbspThe Dark World again brings up the rear, its score of 54 rating puts its reviews into the “mixed or average”\u0026nbspband.\u0026nbspBut compare that with rival franchises. That 54 low point is still better than any of the three Fox Fantastic Four filmsWarner Bros has produced five movies in the much younger DC extended universe, just one of which (Wonder Woman) has garnered “universal acclaim”\u0026nbspwhile being “certified fresh”. They’ve all grossed more than $500m (I’m charitably excluding the disastrous Green Lantern here, which everyone tries to forget about) but not one has breached the $1bn barrier. “Troubled”\u0026nbspis a word that is frequently applied to the project.\u0026nbspDeadpool’ has been\u0026nbspFox’s best grossing superhero flick so farAlthough Fox’s 11-strong X-Men slate has produced several critical hits, it has still turned in three “certified rotten”\u0026nbspduds alongside them.\u0026nbspIts best gross of $783m, meanwhile, came courtesy of the R-\u0026nbspor 15-rated Deadpool, something no one really expected upon the delightfully anarchic movie’s release.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that I’m not allowing for inflation here, and the first X-Men film was released back in 2000, but even had I done so, the X-movies would struggle to hold a candle to the MCU. \u0026nbspThe critics who have speculated (plaintively sometimes) about superhero fatigue setting in got some ammunition courtesy of the (relatively) disappointing opening for Antman \u0026amp The Wasp.\u0026nbspBut that film has now grossed in excess of $100m more than the franchise’s first outing at $620m and counting, which isn’t too shabby for a second tier franchise with a light (for a superhero flick) production and marketing budget.\u0026nbsp“Never bet against Marvel,” said Forbes, reporting on the numbers. And given all that, why would you?In a word, gravity. It has even started to weigh on even a Star Wars franchise that managed to sell three bad movies to an adoring public and looked all but bomb proof until audiences shrugged their shoulders at Solo: A Star Wars Story, which now, shockingly, looks set for a loss despite enjoying mostly positive reviews.\u0026nbspSo Marvel’s job isn’t going to get an easier.\u0026nbspBut it still has cards it can play...This one is blindingly, glaringly obvious. Launching the MCU with mostly middling characters, in terms of public perception, was a big risk. Marvel then doubled down by producing some highly successful films starring heroes that were largely unknown outside of the comic buying public such as Antman, the s, even Dr Strange.Yet in spite, or perhaps because of, a willingness to roll the dice, even on a superhero who’s main power is shrinking in a movie featuring a fight on a Thomas the Tank Engine toy railway that results in Thomas suddenly growing to giant size and exploding out of a house, Marvel has proved remarkably conservative with respect to its leads.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.33 Superhero films set for release between 2016 and 2020 Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Release date: 6 May 2016.

It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016. Following the success of Days of Future Past, Apocalypse will follow the young X-Men team as the battle against Oscar Isaac’s titular villain as he gathers his four horsemen Magneto (Fassbender), Angel (Hardy), Storm (Shipp), and Psylocke (Munn). Expect carnage and no Wolverine. Release date: 5 August 2016. The first ‘supervillain’ film, Suicide Squad is also based in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe, where Batman and Superman live) and will introduce the world to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker. One of the more exciting upcoming DC films that’s for sure.Release date: 4 November 2016. Benedict Cumberbatch will debut in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, where Captain America and Iron Man live) as the Sorcerer Supreme. The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017. Kicking off 2017 is the Lego version of Batman, who will lead his own spin-off, having already featured in the amazing Lego Movie. Will Arnett voices the titular character, while Zach Garfianakis - from the Hangover - will voice The Joker. But will he better than Leto?Release date: 3 March 2017. Having not starred in X-Men: Apocalypse, Wolverine will return to the big screen in a solo film which was recently made R-Rated following the success of Deadpool. It is expected to be Hugh Jackman’s last outing as the titular character.734 7. s of the Galaxy Vol. 2Release date: 5 May 2017.

Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017.

The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War.

It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero.

Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020.

There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020.

Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade.

When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017).

The next s outing is rumoured to focus not on\u0026nbspChris Pratt’s Peter Quill, but\u0026nbspmore on the character of Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, who is of Domican and Puerto Rican descent but is bright green in the films.\u0026nbspApart from the fact that this is the right thing to do, a more erse roster ought to be good for the finances.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, if you’re going to shell out more than $200m in production costs, plus the same again (at least) for the marketing, you need a global audience. The domestic gross just won’t cut it.\u0026nbspTories, Ukipers and Trumpkins can cry about all they want, but the world is a pretty erse place. DC’s Suicide Squad provides another example of how lucrative ersity can be. It had Will Smith at the head of multi-racial cast, with Viola Davis as one of the main antagonists.\u0026nbspDespite the disdain of the critics, the film pulled in a more than healthy $750m, and might have done better had it secured a release in China and not been hampered by a 15 rating in countries like Britain and Australia. Deadline Hollywood nonetheless ranked it as the tenth most profitable movie of 2016. ‘Nuff said.\u0026nbspIt’s not that they’ve been, well, bad. But the MCU’s villains mostly haven’t been particularly memorable, at least not until recently.\u0026nbspIt might be asking a lot to find something that rivals the late Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as The Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight. That sets a very high bar.\u0026nbspBut there’s room for improvement. Beyond Tom Hiddleston’s multiple outings as Loki, I struggle to recall all that much about the others, having seen every MCU film on multiple occasions. They do rather merge into one another.\u0026nbspBut there are signs that that too is changing for the better.\u0026nbspJosh Brolin’s Thanos provides a black hole for the dizzying array of characters featured in Avengers: Infinity War to orbit, and helps bring together what might otherwise have served as a rather aimless series of spectacles.\u0026nbspA study in understated menace, what makes him stand out is his utter conviction that his genocidal vision is right and moral, by contrast to the nihilist portrayed in the comics.Tennant gets his evil on as Kilgrave in ’Jessica Jones’ (Netflix)Then there is the charismatic revolutionary Killmonger (Michael B Jordan). There are many, myself included, who found themselves rooting for him as much as for the Black Panther he faced off against.\u0026nbspOnly his methods, and carelessness towards the civilians getting in his way, make him a villain.This is a good sign, but Marvel’s going to need more multi-faceted and layered baddies if it’s going to counter the feeling of, oh, I see, another superhero flick. I dunno, fancy a game of Fortnite?\u0026nbspPS: If Marvel has any sense it will find a way to resurrect David Tennant’s Kilgrave, who made the first season of Netflix’s Jessica Jones so compelling. His cameos also livened up the disappointing second outing. Now there’s a truly memorable villain. Which brings us neatly to...I’m probably on a hiding to nothing with this one – Marvel Studio’s president Kevin Feige, who deserves much of the credit for the monster that’s been created, has been notably lukewarm about the prospect of bringing it\u0026nbspto the silver screen. Marvel has multiple properties, hosted by multiple broadcasters.\u0026nbspABC’s Agents of Shield started out shadowing the films. The show’s lead character Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) appeared in the first Avengers movie, Thor and two of Iron Man’s three outings. He will show up in the 1990s set Captain Marvel too. Samuel L Jackson, who plays Nick Fury in the movies, also turned up in the show a couple of times.\u0026nbspBut it went on to erge and one of its stars, Chloe Bennet, notably expressed her frustration at the films’ failure to acknowledge the show.\u0026nbspYou could be forgiven for thinking that the mostly successful Netflix series featuring “street”\u0026nbspheroes trying to save their neighbourhoods rather than the galaxy, are set in an entirely different universe.\u0026nbspThey’re grimy, 15 rated, and violent. That violence feels much more real than what is depicted in the films. When people get hit they get hurt. They end up in hospitals. Rosario Dawson’s Night Nurse sometimes has to patch them up.\u0026nbspDeadpool showed how successful taking a 180 degree turn can be. It was produced for just $58m, about a quarter of what it costs to get a top line superhero flick done, and there were no 3D\u0026nbspcameras around on set either.\u0026nbspThe global\u0026nbspgross of the wildly successful ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’The Defenders, in which four of the Netflix stars teamed up for a mini series that, sadly, added up to less than the sum of its parts, occasionally gets mentioned as a possibility for a film, albeit a distant one.\u0026nbspPerhaps that will change if superhero fatigue starts to set in and the studio has to think about something genuinely different to tickle audiences’ palates. Disney’s own streaming ambitions add a further ingredient to the TVfilm crossover stew. \u0026nbspThis is a card the studio really shouldn’t play. When story takes a back seat to spectacle, the film suffers. Warner’s first DC Universe outing, Man of Steel, was ruined by director Zack Snyder indulging in a spectacle laden battle between Superman and General Zod, which smashed up the city of polis. It was jarring –\u0026nbspthe comic book character would have done his damnedest to protect the city –\u0026nbspbut worse still, it was kind of boring.\u0026nbspThe first trailer for Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is hereRuby Rose to star as lesbian superhero Batwoman in new seriesSupergirl to get television’s first ever transgender superheroThe same is true of X-Men: Age of Apocalypse. The hotly anticipated return of Brian Singer, who got the franchise rolling with the critically acclaimed first outing, also majored on spectacle, and the resultant film ending up a disappointing mess after an encouraging start. Story rules. Write that out 10,000 times. Then write it out again. \u0026nbspIf superhero fatigue really does start to set in, there’s always the X-Men – which will be under Disney’s control if and when the entertainment behemoth’s deal to buy a big chunk of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire makes it past America’s anti-trust watchdogs.\u0026nbspIf you bring the mutants into the MCU, and then have them fight a new team of Avengers, like they did in the widely successful Avengers v\u0026nbspX-Men comic book event, you’ll likely have another $2bn beast on your hands, or even multiple such creatures.\u0026nbspGeekdom is positively drooling at the mere thought of such an event. Those of us with a few miles on the clock might keel over if it ultimately gets announced.\u0026nbspHopefully there’ll be a hero or two around to save us.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is a wealth of iniduals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today. “Our banknotes are an opportunity to celebrate the ersity of UK society and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens.

But its high street outlets in the UK suffered a 1 per cent decline and fell by 6 per cent in Ireland.Paddy Power Betfair chief executive Peter Jackson said: Quarter three was a good quarter for the group. In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

weeksClick to followThe IndependentAn overlooked contributor to the discovery of the DNA double helix and the world’s most famous cosmologist are among those in the running to be the new face of the £50 note.The Bank of England has invited the public to submit the names of\u0026nbspscientific figures they’d like to appear on the new banknote, with a decision set to be announced in six weeks.A shortlist will be drawn up by an expert committee including space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock and physicist Simon Singh, with the final decision to be made by the Bank’s governor, Mark Carney.But who are the favourites to\u0026nbspadorn\u0026nbspthe new £50 notes, and what have been their contributions to science and UK society?Many people’s favourite to win will undoubtedly be the recently deceased Hawking, a true scientific superstar whose contributions to science extended far beyond his own discipline.Particle physicist and TV presenter Professor Brian Cox expressed his support for Hawking on the new note,\u0026nbsptweeting: “He made invaluable contributions over half a century to our understanding of cosmology, the early universe and black holes.”Professor Cox added that the former Cambridge academic has inspired thousands of scientists and millions of people through his books and lectures, “me included”.Hawking gave his name to the radiation emitted by black holes, advanced studies of the universe’s origins\u0026nbspand penned the bestselling popular science book A Brief History of Time to transmit ideas from his discipline to more than 10 million readers.Franklin’s work as an X-ray crystallographer at King’s College London produced images that contributed to James Watson and Francis Crick’s identification of the DNA double helix.In the years following her death in 1958, her crucial work has been recognised by many including Watson and Crick themselves, but Franklin was not included in the Nobel Prize the duo went on to win four years later.Franklin’s story is now seen as a cautionary tale about the ways the contributions of women have been ignored over the course of scientific history.A place on the £50 note would be seen by many as a fantastic way to honour a scientist who was never given the recognition she deserved in her lifetime.Katherine Mathieson, chief executive of the British Science Association, mentioned Franklin along with palaeontologist Mary Anning as potential faces for the new notes.“They were both underrecognised in their lifetime and now we could set the record straight and recognise the huge achievements they made,” she said.Another figure seen as an overlooked\u0026nbspscientific pioneer from a time when women were not traditionally included in science, Lovelace is often described as the world’s first computer programmer.The daughter of poet Lord Byron, Lovelace was a mathematician who worked on Charles Babbage’s proposed computer, the Analytical Engine.Lovelace translated an article by an Italian military engineer concerning the engine, adding an elaborate set of notes that contain what some have described as the first ever computer program – an algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine.Like Franklin, Lovelace has only recently been recognised for her contribution, and her addition to the new £50 would therefore be a fitting tribute for someone who was not recognised in their lifetime.In his role as a codebreaker during the Second World War, Turing played a major part in helping defeat Nazi Germany by providing the allied forces\u0026nbspwith information that gave them the upper hand in key operations.His work at Bletchley Park during the war cracked the German messages sent by the Enigma machine, and is regarded as making key contributions to the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.Turing was convicted in 1952 under anti-homosexuality laws, leading to him accepting chemical castration and ultimately taking his own life two years later.Though he was posthumously pardoned in 2013, many will surely see a place on the currency as a way to honour his legacy.As the only British woman to become a Nobel science laureate, Hodgkin would be another perfect addition to the UK’s currency, and one who many people are perhaps not familiar with.The chemist won the prize in 1964 for her pioneering work that helped unravel the 3D structure of important substances such as insulin.Her nomination was backed by Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan, who said: “I would personally pick Dorothy Hodgkin, the only female Briton to have won a science Nobel Prize.”“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B12, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers.“She was also a remarkable inidual who championed science in developing countries.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

When I went in for my last day of recording, I wanted to have my back to them, because usually, you’re facing him so he can look right up and you can talk about it. But I didn’t want to see them and pretend they couldn’t see me.“When I realised what they were going for, I realised, ‘Oh, this is a moment in history’.”Buzz Lightyear actor Allen previously revealed the final scene is so emotional he could barely get through it. He described the way the film’s writers, Will McCormack and Stephany Folsom, decided to end the sequel as “so big” it startled him.Created with Sketch.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Delighted that he has come over to Northern Ireland and made a visit to the various ports, we look forward to continuing our engagement with him,” she told reporters.Government urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitWho are the key EU politicians involved Brexit negotiations?No 10 yet to decide on EU free movement after no-deal BrexitShe said her party has made it clear to the UK cabinet minister that “from the constitutional point of view but also from an economic point of view that it is very important that as well as not having any customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers”.Though the party leader struck an optimistic tone, her account of the meeting would suggest she doubled down on her red lines on checks on the Irish sea.The British government says it agrees with the DUP\u0026nbspand will not accept a customs border on the Irish sea, viewing it as a breach of sovereignty. But senior UK government officials have indicated that they would be willing to accept a regulatory barrier – a concession that would make finding common ground with the EU a lot easier.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator has said that there would have to be regulatory checks, however, and that they might increase ten-fold. There has been no outward sign that the EU is shifting its position in that regard.Ms Foster welcomed Mr Raab’s Friday visit to Northern Ireland, adding: “I am glad that he took the chance to visit the ports today because he would have been able to see what happens at the ports.“We are engaged in an ongoing process, we want to be as helpful as we can in these negotiations, we want to get a deal on exiting the European Union that is good for Northern Ireland and it can only be good for Northern Ireland if we remain a full part of the United Kingdom.”The dispute around the Northern Ireland border stems from a commitment by both the UK and EU to avoid a hard border between the Republic and the North, but disagreement on how this should be achieved once the UK leaves the EU and trade barriers are re-erected.Theresa May\u0027s decision to leave the single market and customs union means that there would ordinarily have to be checks on goods between the UK and EU, but both sides want to mitigate this for the special circumstances on the island of Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement stipulates that there can be no hard border.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are seeing a systematic attack on our democracy that extends much further than just one isolated terrorist in Florida,” he wrote. “That\u0027s why we are running an impeachment petition to end the culture of lawlessness in our country.”The most recent package was similar in appearance to the others, the FBI said in a statement Friday.Pipe bomb suspect \u0027had list of people in hundreds\u0027 to send packagesThe FBI has confirmed a package was recovered last night in California, similar in appareance to the others, addressed to Tom Steyer, the federal agency tweeted Friday afternoon.It was not immediately clear whether the package also contained the same explosive devices or materials included in the packages sent to the Obamas, the Clintons, Maxine Waters, Joe Biden, Deborah Wasserman Schultz and others.Investigators scouring Mr Sayoc’s social media accounts had found the same spelling mistakes on his online posts — “Hilary” Clinton, Deborah Wasserman “Shultz” — as on the mailings he was charged with sending.Prosecutors have charged Sayoc with five federal crimes and said the president’s fervent supporter unwittingly left behind a wealth of clues about the mailed pipe-bombs.Meanwhile, Mr Trump has called Mr Steyer a “crazed and stumbling lunatic” in the days after he received the first suspicious package, writing in a tweet that the billionaire would “be running out of money pretty soon” and “if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!”Mr Steyer then shot back on Twitter, calling it “unthinkable” that the president “would resort to name-calling instead of repairing the damage to the fabric of our country.”Authorities said pipe bombs addressed to Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former CIA director John Brennan and former Attorney General Eric Holder have also been intercepted in recent days.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Salvadorean migrant with a girl walks next to Guatemalan policemen as they approach the Guatemala-Mexico international border bridge in Ciudad Tecun Uman.

DFID declined to comment on the latest projects hit.\u0026nbspSince Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies launched a bombing campaign to oust the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the spring of 2015, the UK has sold an\u0026nbspestimated £3.87billion worth of arms to Riyadh.And despite reassurances from the UK government that its intelligence support and training of the Saudi-led forces is helping reduce civilian casualties, the latest report from the Yemen Data Project (YDP) shows that 48 per cent of all known airstrikes hit non-military targets.“This is now a trend that has continued since June and peaked in September with 48 per cent of air raids targeting civilian sites.”She continued: “This continuing rise of civilian targeting has also been reflected in the casualty figures.”Hodeidah, Yemen (AP)Apart from October 2015, which matched that percentage, September saw\u0026nbspthe highest rate since the start of the three-year long war, reported the organisation, which tracks the airstrikes.Andrew Mitchell, Conservative MP for Sutton Coldfield and former international development secretary, described the UK’s policy on Yemen as\u0026nbsppunching\u0026nbspa person in the face and then offering them a plaster.“These statistics lay bare the errors of judgment which Britain has made in its support for the Saudi coalition on Yemen,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Instead of using our influence at the UN to secure a ceasefire and a peace process we are widely viewed as complicit in causing monstrous famine conditions.“Britain makes a point of emphasising our financial support for Yemen through aid but this is a bit like punching him in the face and then offering him a sponge and an Elastoplast.Theresa May has supported “de-escalation” in Yemen but stopped short of endorsing US demands for a ceasefire. She\u0026nbsphas faced mounting pressure from opposition and Conservative Party MPs\u0026nbspto rethink the relationship with Saudi Arabia, one of the UK’s chief allies in the region.Theresa May fails to back US calls for Saudi to stop bombing YemenBritain ‘complicit’ in Yemen famine, Tory ex-cabinet minister warnsThe Yemen war death toll is five times higher than we thinkLloyd Russell-Moyle, Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, who sits on the International Development Committee and the Committee on Arms Export Controls,\u0026nbspsaid bombing our own aid was a “grim irony”.He told The Independent: “The government maintains the deceit that the British troops embedded in the Saudi air command centres are there to reduce civilian deaths in Yemen. As the number of civilian strikes are rising, both absolutely and as a proportion of total strikes, it either means our military presence in Saudi Arabia is totally ineffectual or that Britain is coordinating these attacks against civilians.”The Saudi-led coalition began bombing the country in 2015, imposing\u0026nbspa crippling land, sea and air blockade. The campaign was intended\u0026nbspto re-instate president Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi, who was ousted by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels when they took\u0026nbspcontrol of the country in\u0026nbsp2014.The Houthis have been accused of bombing aid convoys and laying siege to pro-government areas, leading to starvation.Britain makes a point of emphasising our financial support for Yemen through aid but this is a bit like punching him in the face and then offering him a sponge and an\u0026nbspElastoplast\u0026nbspPeace negotiations collapsed this\u0026nbspSeptember, and despite calls for renewed talks, thousands of government troops are\u0026nbspamassing around the Red sea port of Hodeidah ahead of a renewed offensive.In the interim the conflict has sparked a humanitarian crisis – with two thirds of Yemen’s population now relying\u0026nbspon aid.Lise Grande, the UN’s coordinator for Yemen, said last month that as many as 13 million civilians could die from starvation if the bombardment continues. On Friday the United Nations warned that a looming famine could put 2 million mothers at risk of death.Mukalla, Yemen, provides care for children suffering hunger and famineSaudi Arabia has come under increased scrutiny for its attacks,\u0026nbspwhich have hit hospitals, schools, homes and\u0026nbspmarket places.The Gulf coalition has repeatedly denied accusations by rights groups such as Human Rights Watch that its actions in Yemen amount to war crimes, or that it strikes civilian infrastructure.They maintain that they conduct comprehensive reconnaissance before each mission, and have in the past accused the Houthis of using civilians as human shields.This week Doctors Without Borders said their health facilities have been hit five times by the coalition since the war erupted in 2015, killing 21 patients and staff, and injuring 33 others.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

burglars","story":"Sophie Hannah wrote A Dark Time to pass on security hints and tips to homeowners who find themselves at increased risk of burglary during the winter months.Seven homes in the UK are burgled every minute across a calendar year.A study of , homeowners carried out by a home security firm to coincide with the launch of the book found  per cent of Brits have no security measures in place whatsoever.A Dark Time is the latest entry in Hannah’s Waterhouse and Zailer series, which started in  with the release of Little Face, which sold over , copies in the UK.Sophie Hannah said: “I’ve really loved writing A Dark Time.I had an idea that Id really wanted to try out for ages – and raising awareness around the increased risks to home security now that the nights are getting darker was the perfect fit for executing it.My story idea needed exactly that setting, a dark night, and involved a burglary of a very peculiar kind – a puzzle that I knew my detectives Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer would enjoy solving.UK homes are at an elevated risk of burglary thanks to the clocks going back, according to research.December was revealed as the peak time for break-ins across the UK, with  per cent of Brits experiencing a burglary in the last year alone.And six in  Brits feel more vulnerable to a break-in when the nights grow longer.However, keeping our homes warm and making sure energy bills are paid are the nation’s top concerns after the clocks go back – ahead of securing our castles.Nearly a quarter of Brits have fitted a security alarm to warn off potential intruders, and  per cent keep their house lights on to make it look like someone is home.A further  per cent close their blinds or curtains while they’re out, and just under a tenth have bought a dog to deter burglars from targeting their property.Lee Jasper, security expert at ADT said: “Year on year, we have seen a  per cent increase in burglaries during the darker months.So it’s vital that people put the right security measures in place to help protect their homes to avoid falling victim.“The research shows we’re feeling more vulnerable as a nation when the clocks go back, however there is a clear lack of awareness when it comes down to preventing burglaries.“We’re hoping that the launch of A Dark Time can help the nation safeguard their homes, in an entertaining and engaging way.”A Dark Time is available as a free download from the ADT website from Monday nd October on: https:www.adt

however other students told their parents he may be much older than he says he is.It had been suggested that the inidual is an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK without any paperwork, making it dficult to identy his age.Students and parents claim he lied to British authorities about his age to get an education, as his previous qualications were not recognised in the UK.The Home Office has taken on the investigation into the age of the pupil and how he became enrolled at the school.When asked for a comment a spokesman for the Home Office said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”Sources at the Home Office confirmed that the investigation was being treated “seriously” and appealed for the pupil to be given privacy.In a statement, Stoke High School said: “This is a matter for the Home Office and we have referred it to them.School bosses dropped a suggestion from a previous statement which suggested that the pupil was an asylum seeker.It continued: The student is not attending the school at this time.“We can not comment further on an inidual case, but we have followed Government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any admissions matter. ”Parents have blasted the school over the investigation, accusing school bosses of trying to sweep it under the carpet.One mum fumed in a Facebook post: So My son’s school now let’s in ‘ year old men’ claiming to be a  year old.He’s been there since the start of last term, that’s some huge security breach.Not funny at all but ffs look at his picture of him in class c’mon now I’m  he looks older than me!She said she was later told the pupil had been taken out of school pending investigation.The mum added: If my son didnt like the school Id be taking him out permanently!Another worried parent, who did not want to be named, told the East Anglican Daily Times: “This is extremely concerning.He has told students he has had to lie to get into high school to complete his GCSEs.”A pupil took an image of the inidual dressed in unorm during a year  maths class.The text across the image reads: How is there a  year old man in our maths class.Another parent raged: “My son goes to the school and it is not a nice thought that this man is around children and sitting with them at lunch.”If there is a doubt about someones age as part of an immigration case, the Home Office can arrange for social workers to undertake an assessment.Because there are dferent rules for the treatment of adult and child asylum seekers, the authority has to establish at the outset the age category an inidual is in.Age indicators can include assessments of physical appearance such as height, build, facial hair and voice pitch.The Sun Online has approached the Home Office and Stoke High School for further

Far from being born into royalty he grew up as an orphan in Colombia.He had managed to make his way into the highest echelons of the global elite after befriending a well-connected asset manager from Orsett in Essex.Carl Marden Williamson, who had moved to the US in his s, was an ideal accomplice — being, according to a former colleague, “a master global networker”.It was urbane, charming Williamson who helped Gignac buy fake diplomatic licence plates from eBay — and who assured Florida’s elite that he had known the prince and his family for  years.Gignac’s aim in Florida was to rake in cash for what he promised would be hugely lucrative shares in Saudi oil giant Aramco, which was worth more than £.trillion.And he looked the part. He was accompanied everywhere by ‘bodyguards’ — handsome men wearing fake diplomatic badges and toting fake guns.A friend said: “Every single building you’d drive by he’d say, ‘Oh, my father owns that’.“He’d just spend, spend, spend, dumping out cash from Louis Vuitton duffle bags and tipping hundred-dollar bills to everyone: building managers, employees, handymen.”The fake prince’s Instagram account features photos of his private jet and yacht, wads of cash, Rolex watches and a dazzling diamond ring.Even tiny Foxy travelled around in a £, Louis Vuitton dog carrier.Gignac’s obsession with wealth is no doubt linked to his troubled childhood.He was one of the orphaned “throwaway” children on the mean streets of Colombia’s capital Bogota, and claims he had to look after his little brother by any means necessary.In a court statement he once revealed: “I was raped when I was five years old and sold on the streets to have sex with men to feed my brother. You don’t know the pain I’ve gone through.”But he was plucked from the crime-ridden city in , when a middle-class American couple adopted Anthony and his brother and moved them to Michigan.An exceptionally bright pupil, Gignac would lie to school friends that his parents were vastly wealthy.Aged , he ran away from home and assumed the identity of Saudi billionaire Prince Adnan Khashoggi.Soon he switched to a new target, Prince Khalid bin al-Saud, real-le son of the current Saudi king, and threw himself into the le of a career criminal.Over the years, he was often hauled before the courts, serving a number of jail terms for ious frauds worth tens of thousands of pounds.After being released, somehow he always managed to find new victims and keep up the charade.But when Gignac met suave Carl Marden Williamson in , a whole new world of possibilities opened up.The Brit was fabulously well connected, with “a Rolodex that was probably thousands of people”, according to we Denise.A former colleague told Vanity Fair magazine: “His line of bulls**t would change depending on the person he was talking to.“If you didn’t have a connection, he would be like, ‘Yeah, I know the guy. Let me go ahead and call them.’ It was frickin’ amazing.” Suddenly, Gignac had access to a huge global network of the rich and powerful.Together, they set up an investment company, Marden Williamson International LLC, and before long,  wealthy investors had transferred almost £.million into its account.Williamson also introduced the fraudster to a high-profile banker in London.She not only wired through £, of her own money, but also helped him to secure the investors who wired the millions to Marden Williamson International.An investment banker who was one of those to hand over cash, thinking it was for shares in Aramco — soon to be floated on the stockmarket at a value of £.trillion — later admitted: “I was fooled. It was a big, big, big scam.”Emboldened, the bogus Saudi began working on one of his most brazen schemes to date.In March last year, billionaire developer Jeffrey Soffer — then married to supermodel Elle Macpherson — was looking to sell the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel.To his surprise, the prince offered to buy it for £million more than what it was actually worth.Soffer, who was in the middle of finalising his orce from we of four years Elle, jumped at the prospect of the investment from someone he believed to be in “direct line” to the Saudi throne.But before the deal was agreed, the prince let it be known that he expected a certain level of respect.A source told Vanity Fair: “He indicated that one of the customs of his country was to exchange very lavish gts during the negotiation process.”So Soffer showered him with gts, including a £, Cartier bracelet and expensive artwork.The real estate mogul also flew Gignac to Aspen on his private plane for negotiations, where the prince stayed at the luxurious St Regis hotel and spent time at Soffer’s home.Then one night, while out for dinner with the Soffer family, Gignac made his fatal mistake.When choosing his starter, the man who had presented himself as a devout Muslim, ordered pork — asking for the prosciutto.The Soffer family instantly knew something was amiss and had their security team investigate the prince.They soon discovered what they called “key information that this person isn’t what he claims to be”.The Soffers tipped off police and Gignac was eventually arrested at JFK airport in New York last November when he presented a fake passport. He will go on trial in Miami on fraud and identity theft charges in January. A month after his arrest, agents interrogated his colleague Williamson, , for six hours at his home in North Carolina before charging him over the scam.When they left, his we Denise asked Williamsonhe knew the prince was a fraud. He said: “I didn’t know.” She believed him.That night Williamson, the father of two teenage boys, tried to kill himself and died two days later of his injuries.In an obituary, Denise called him a “mediocre domino player, occasional enthusiastic gardener, sore loser and intermittent fashionista”.She added: “My kids and I often cringed at what came out of his mouth, but he was also passionate, caring, had a generous nature and could make me fall down laughing.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ghostbusters . Indiana Jones And The Annoying Son. The horrors that unfolded after Superman IV.Buttheres one movie that would benefit us all to see play out in Westminster, its True Lies : Mr Cameron Comes To Town. Otherwise known as the latest instalment in the Entitlement Chronicles.Theres nothing quite like over-weening self-belief for encouraging people to make arses of themselves, so we must thank Eton, Oxford and the Bullingdon Club for instilling so much of it in David William Donald Cameron, scion of William IV and une grande dame of believing he was born for the role.Today hes announced - well, lets be fair, he confided in a friend who put it on the front page of The Sun - he is bored s***less and would quite like to be made first a peer, and then Foreign Secretary. We have not been informed whether his preferred post is linked in any way to the skirt-lting, achievement-free high-jinks of his old mucker Boris Johnson in that position, because a spokesman refused to comment on the article. Perhaps that was because his boss, who was once such a bad PR man for Carlton TV he would answer the press office phone pretending to be the cleaner in order to evade questions, considered the press release to be all the info anyone needed.  David is dedicated to public service and has often said he wouldnt rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally, said the friend, in an instruction to the nations current rulers to get him a cushy job in either the UN, NATO, or the international male modelling sector. After all, David Gandys going on paternity leave and those swimming trunks wont sell themselves.  He is only  and still a young man, added the friend, although it is unclear whether he was talking about the portly former PMs age, or his softening waist measurement. For since ordering a referendum that had the same effect on the nation as a dodgy takeaway, and leaving the resulting sloppy mess on the mat, Dishface has slunk off to enjoy the fruits of  fairly disastrous years in office. Those benefits have so far included a third home, not one but two pound, faux-shepherd huts, and a reported pound, advance for the memoirs he has conspicuously failed to write in the posh boy sheds, which some fool had installed a bed in.  He has been spotted lunching with Nick Clegg, dipping into the private gentlemens club Whites which he had abandoned when running for office, shooting game in Oxfordshire and making big money speeches. But his mates cant play tennis at lunchtime, Jeremy Clarkson is barely speaking to him and his former Number  is scooping up all the post-Parliamentary jobs and cash. So a permanent state of well-remunerated chillaxing is not making Cameron happy. Aww. Sadly a nice quiet job in Brussels is now off the cards after some bright spark called a vote to seepeople agreed with a multi-homed millionaire with a mouth like a cats bum. But there are a few jobs in public le that would suit all of us right down to the ground, and involve him fixing some of the problems he created. For example: . Libya  Making the man a peace envoy to the failed state riven by factional jihadis may be the only thing that will redeem Cameron to international historians. The man who once walked the streets of Tripoli accepting the jubilation of crowds freed from the oppression of Colonel Gaddafi would surely find it an easy task to persuade them to stop beheading, trafficking, murdering, raping and throwing desperate migrants into the Mediterranean in things that are called boats only by the criminally insane. If he found that too tricky, perhaps he could concentrate on collecting all the guns he released to the fundamentalist militia when he ordered RAF bombing raids on Gaddafis armouries, on the basis that Brits arming the rebels was not allowed, but Brits bombing a path to the weapons was a great wheeze. No  Well then perhaps he could try: . Food banks  At the start of Camerons reign in  , the Trussell Trust - largest food bank provider in the UK - handed out , food packs to people who relied on charity to eat. By the time he abdicated responsibility in   it was .million. And the Trussell Trust runs only about half of all food banks, so the real figure may be twice that. Even a cursory glance will inform you that David Cameron is not a man who has ever gone without pudding, so who better to be put in charge of ensuring pensioners, children, and hard-working but poorly-paid adults get fed  All right, they might find Weetabix, teabags and tins of beans are replaced with pheasant, dessert wine and foie gras, but whats a little gout matter when you can wobble your chins with joy.  . Hideous Gideon If that doesnt float your vengeance boat perhaps youd like to task him with releasing the nation from the cold, dead hands of George Osborne, the man who changed his name to sound more Prime Ministerial but thought being a lizard wouldnt matter. Im sure Gideons paying tax on all that lovely wonga hes making while planning how to chop up Theresa May and put her in his freezer, but perhaps David could confirm for us that none of it has found its way to Panama. . BORIS. F***ING BORIS Of the three Tory leaders who were stupid enough to give Boris Johnson a job, only Cameron failed to make him resign. The blond buffoon has trailed in his wake since school, knocking over ornaments, goosing the girls and generally annoying everyone. Its time Cameron took responsibility for the objectionable hound and had him neutered and enrolled in puppy school. . Oh yes, almost forgot. Total chaos  With the  Health and Social Care Act, Cameron cut a poundbillion-a-year management tier out of the NHS and then wondered why no-one was managing the NHS very well. And instead of properly funding social care, he took more money from the NHS to pay for it, while removing money from local authorities so they couldnt pay for it, with the net result that neither the NHS or social care had enough money. Then he cut every single part of the state. He removed investment from the economy. He sold the Post Office, Eurostar and Northern Rock for less than you could get at a boot sale and had the brass neck to say that the resulting economic despair was Labours fault. To top it all, he put the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in a blender just to get rid of Nigel Farage, when all he actually needed to do was throw a few French waitresses at him. Were left with constitutional crisis, talk of barbed wire in Ballyconnell and Nigel has persisted like gristle stuck in a back molar. If Cameron really wants to make himself useful and perform a public service he could become chairman of the board at LBC, and fire the snivelling little toad.The list of Camerons cock-ups is long and glorious enough for anyone to spot that politics, and possibly cutlery, is beyond him. Theresa May has a drastic lack of achievement, but unlike her predecessor shes not got a failed state, starvation or laziness on her CV. There could be nothing more just, more popcorn-tastic, than rubbing Camerons nose in the crap he left us to deal with. If theres anyone who needs to learn about shit, its him.

Darren Harris forked out pound, for his four-bedroom home in Pembrokeshire, Wales, before it was built. But he says the condition of it has reduced his family to tears - and left his neighbours in stitches, Wales Online reports. Darren claims the property has a garden that is not level, a badly-fitted door and paving stones laid into the ground without cement.Astonishingly, he even says thathis marriage wasnt so strong, the state of the house could have finished it.  Darren says he has dealt with more than  defects since he got the keys for his new-build. Even his neighbours have been laughing at his expense, he says, pointing out the wonky brickwork at the side of the house. Persimmon, who built the house, say they are aware of the concerns and are working to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Mr Harris claims the problems started on day one. In June, I got the keys to my house and we drove down to the property, he said. The neighbours came over and asked meI had seen the brickwork on the back of the house.  They said to me We have been having a bit of a laugh and a giggle. When Mr Harris took a look, he claims he was confronted with wavy brickwork that wasnt straight and looked unsightly. The -year-old civil engineer was shocked. I know all about brickwork. Im a builder myself, and have run my own company for  years, he said. But the walls were just the start of his problems. As he entered his finished house for the first time, he tried to put the key in the door. But the door wouldnt budge. We couldnt get in, he said. I thought there must be a problem and went back to the site office. A Persimmon agent came back with me and in the end, he had to shoulder-barge the door to get it open.  It turned out the door frame had been fitted badly, he claimed.But the problems carried on. Mr Harris said: The problems are unbelieveable. He had bought the house at Martello Park, Pembroke before it was built. Together with his we, who is an area manager for Greggs, he has a number of buy-to-let properties in Pembrokeshire. He had planned to rent out the house once it had been completed. When we went to see the development initially, we looked round the show home, Mr Harris said. It looked like a nice spot, with views onto Pembroke Castle, so we put a deposit down in February . But ever since he got the keys, he claims the reality has been far from perfect. As well as the poor brickwork, we have found paving slabs have been laid straight onto rubble and earth, without any cement, he alleged.  The ground isnt level in the garden, the drain covers are sticking out of the ground, and the drains are positioned in the wrong place so the water runs straight past them. While I was there, I saw a worker laying some slabs and I could see he was doing it all wrong. Im a bricklayer by trade, so it was clear to me there were no footings under the paving. Even the guttering is all wrong, and not just on my property. None of the guttering reaches the end of the houses and water cascades down the sides when it rains. While I was mowing the lawn, I kicked my foot on the raised drain cover and actually broke my foot, causing me to take three weeks off work. Its caused my we and I no end of worry and stress. She has been in tears. If my marriage wasnt so strong this could have finished us.  Mr Harris, who lives in Sutton Coldfield in the Midlands, posted pictures of his house on Facebook. He says he is not usually the type of person to take to social media, but he was directed to a Facebook page for Persimmon home owners. He said: After I posted my story, I was contacted by Persimmon who said they would like to address my complaints. They sent a young guy round – he could only have been  years old. He spent half a day taking doors on and off, and making it worse. While Persimmon agreed to recty some of the issues, the problems persisted and Mr Harris took to fixing the problems himself. He drove the -mile round trip between the Midlands and Pembrokeshire throughout the summer, staying on a mattress in the back room of the Martello Park property.  Now, after spending thousands of his own money to fix the problems, Mr Harris has decided to take the national house builder to court. I have been on to head office. I have been brave enough to take them on and take them to the small claims court, he said. The rectication work they attempted was not acceptable. I have given them the opportunity to put it right. I have had to put off getting my tenants in, which has resulted in losses of pound,. We have been forced to get on with the retrospective work ourselves and it has cost us thousands. Thats the only way I could get the house finished and ready for our tenants. A spokesman for Persimmon Homes West Wales said: We are aware of Mr Harris’ concerns and we are working to reach a satisfactory conclusion. We have many happy customers across South Wales and we take customer service seriously.

Great Yarmouth Charter Academy - which last month called in ‘unorm police’ to measure girls’ skirt hems - told -year-old Courtney Dougal to take off the knitted tribute. School bosses said the symbol was “too large” - despite being just cm bigger than the traditional paper poppy. Courtney, in Year  at the Norfolk high school, had worn the poppy with pride on Tuesday only to be told by principal Barry Smith to remove it. Her dad Raymond Dougal, , said he was “absolutely disgusted” by the school’s tough stance.  He said: “I am absolutely disgusted that they have made her take the poppy off. It is a little bit on the larger side but that is what makes it. “If it was huge and looked ridiculous I would not have sent her in it. “As it is it looks lovely. She is only little so that probably makes it look bigger than it is.” He added: “I said to Courtney to just go in and wear it but she didn’t dare.” Mr Dougal bought the poppy in his local pub The Sportsmans Arms in Great Yarmouth, with contributions going to the Royal British Legion. Landlord John Vale said the school “overstepped the mark” this time, branding the ban “disrespectful”. Charter Academy defended the move. A statement said: “Poppies are available in school and we encourage pupils and staff to wear them unfortunately in this case we felt that the large knitted poppy was not appropriate to wear in school.  “We are keen that pupils recognise and respect the sacrices made in war, and pupils are being encouraged to learn the poem In Flanders Field. “Many will be taking part in the town’s Remembrance Day service on November . “We are also refurbishing and relocating plaques commemorating former pupils of the Great Yarmouth Grammar School that served in battle, as a permanent reminder of that important heritage.” Last month, furious parents hit out after the school called in unorm police to measure theof girls’ skirts. Experts from a nearby unorm shop were consulted after pupils started turning up in short skirts. he academy has previously been criticised for its strict new rules on unorm and haircuts - banning one style called Meet Me at McDonald’s.

Mostly young men from the British Empire, Germany, France and Russia, these premature deaths were all equally awful for bereaved families. But today few stories resound as profoundly as those of John and George. At just , John, a golf caddy from Finchley, North London, had lied about his age to enlist. George, , was an experienced soldier from Leeds. In le they had little in common. But in death they will be forever remembered as the first and last British casualties of the First World War. Remarkably, their graves are only a few yards apart, separated by a thin stretch of perfectly manicured grass at the Saint-Symphorien war cemetery in Mons, Belgium. Although their deaths came more than four years apart, both men were killed on the edge of the same city.  Glyn Prysor of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission says: “The remarkable combination of ‘the first’ and ‘the last’ makes this cemetery particularly poignant. There are so many stories among the graves in this place.” Former miner George Ellison, can perhaps be considered the marginally more unlucky of the two men, even though he was much older than Pte Parr. Part of the original British Expeditionary Force of , shipped to Europe in August , he was involved in the initial battles around Mons, then Ypres, Armentiegraveres, Loos and Cambrai. Wounded at least once, he had recovered in time to join the advance as the over-stretched Germans began falling back from Belgium in the summer and autumn of . Having survived so much, he lost his le back in Mons again,  minutes before the bugle sounded the Armistice. He left behind a we, Hannah, and a two-year-old son James. When the actual ceasefire was signed in the forest of Compiegne five hours earlier, he would have been one of the few soldiers from the original BEF still alive. A century later, he is to be recognised with a plaque at Leeds City Station. Exactly what happened to John Parr has been shrouded in mystery ever since his mother went to the War Office in October  demanding news of her missing youngest son. Alice Parr was desperate but the military officials had nothing to offer. It is thought the young soldier, who enlisted as a -year-old in , and another recruit were sent out on bicycles to scout for the enemy.  The th Middlesex Regiment had arrived in Mons that day after marching from the French port of Boulogne over the previous week. Until that point, they had not seen a single German. Equally, German commanders were unaware the British Army was already in northern France, let alone Belgium. The idea was that John and his companion, a man called Beart, would report back to their CO in the village of Obourg, north of Mons. But on spotting the field grey unorms of the Germans directly ahead, John’s comrade reportedly turned around to pedal back to their battalion. The Germans opened fire and the younger solshyshydier was never seen again. British troops retreated and John’s body was presumably left behind. His death was not even officially reported until a year later. As late as January , the Infantry Records Office was writing to Alice to say her son was still with his battalion. These doubts have prompted several historians to cast doubt on the date on John’s headstone. But due to the chaos of those early war days, it is unlikely anyone will ever know for sure. A paving stone in the young soldier’s memory was unveiled outside his home in Finchley four years ago. There is also a plaque at North Middlesex Golf Club, where he was a caddy.  In an extraordinary quirk of fate, Mons is also the place where Allied forces fired their first and last shots of the conflict. A plaque in the adjoining village of Casteau marks where the BEF made its first official contact with the enemy at am on August ,  – the day after Pte Parr’s death. Cpl E. Thomas of the th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards is recorded as firing the first shot. These first contacts established what would become the Western Front. Back in , the generals believed the skirmishes would result in a quick war over in months. None of the top brass anticipated that both armies would eventually dig vast networks of trenches that would prevent signicant advances on either side for years. One of the saddest aspects of that final phase of the war is that George Ellison was far from alone – there were almost , casualties that last day. These men died even though their leaders knew war was about to end.  George does not even have the dubious distinction of being the last Allied soldier killed in the war. That was a Canadian, Pte George Price, , shot by a sniper at .am – two minutes before the ceasefire came into force. He, too, is buried in Saint-Symphorien, “one of the most beautul and unusual cemeteries on the Western Front,” according to Dr Prysor. He says “It looks completely dferent from other Commonwealth cemeteries because it was actually created by the Germans while the war was still being fought. “An old mining area was donated by a local landowner and planted with dark trees and shrubs to give the feeling of a woodland glade. “Both British and German soldiers were buried there and they were treated with equal dignity and respect.” And on this bleak autumn day, a century on from the Armistice, Saint-Symphorien remains a permanent reminder of the ultimate futility of “the war to end all wars”.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

Justin Levene, from north London, says he was left with no option but to crawl after his self-propelling wheelchair went missing. Staff had offered to push him through the airport using a high-backed wheelchair but Levene rejected this, stating that it robbed him of his independence. The video shows Levene dragging himself through the busy airport terminal as passengers walk by.  At one stage he even uses a luggage trolley to transport himself around the building. The incident happened in August  after Levene had arrived back in the UK following a flight from Croatia. Levene, who is a successful wheelchair athlete, was paralysed from the waist down after a operation to correct a herniated disc went wrong.  Levene is now suing Luton Airport after being left disappointed with the airports response, according to the BBC. He said: Ive worked very hard for a number of years to try and maintain all of my independence. And to be in one of the chairs they were offering would make me feel humiliated and degraded. They insisted in trying to strap me down in it. I wouldnt have been able to adjust myself, and would have been at risk of getting a pressure sore. Justins solicitors, Deighton Pierce Glynn, said the case isnt really about money, its about access to justice. Its time for Luton airport and other transport providers to be a bit more imaginative and enable disabled people to travel on equal terms with non-disabled passengers.  A Luton Airport statement said: On discovering that Mr Levene’s flight from Croatia had arrived without his wheelchair, our teams worked hard to find a solution, offering Mr Levene an assisted wheelchair as a temporary replacement. Mr Levene declined all offers of help. Whilst we apologiseMr Levene was dissatisfied with the service he received, we are satisfied that our agents and staff did all they could in dficult circumstances.

Lena Taylor, , was convicted of making nuisance calls to the emergency services in July, when she received a two-year conditional discharge.But the elderly Taylor was back in the dock last month having made a further  calls to the emergency services between Jule  and August , reports Chronicle Live.But, seemingly undeterred, once again Taylor, of Wallsend, was back in court for a third time for a further nine phone calls. She walked free from North Tyneside Magistrates Court after pleading guilty to a malicious communications offence.  Lee Poppett, prosecuting, said: Mrs Taylor was abusive during the course of those telephone calls using foul and abusive language and not in fact reporting any emergency incident. The court heard that between July  and August , Taylor had been a great strain on resources and had an ambulance sent to her house on four occasions. Taylor was taken to hospital once but the other three times, she did not need hospital treatment. During one call on July , she rang saying Ive done my dinner, I need someone to take me to bingo to keep me calm. Stop f****** messing around with me. Im not going to sit in this house all day. A few days later on July  she demanded an ambulance and said: I want them here now. Bring me a cup of tea and a pasty. Hurry up Im starving. In another call later, she said: My pastys f****** fell on the floor you stupid c***s, get the ambulance out now. Mr Poppett added: Trust staff are reportedly being abused, insulted and sworn at and this is causing distress. There is concern about the impact its having on the staff.  But despite her repeated appearances before the court, it was revealed Taylor has continued to make abusive phone calls in the last few days. The court heard that Taylor has made  calls to the emergency services in the last three days. Mark Harrison, defending, said: This is a lady who has reached her th birthday without a conviction or caution against her name. Then in the course of this calender year she has found herself in a situation where her liberty could be at risk. Its a huge sadness that Mrs Taylor has found herself again appearing before the criminal courts. She has almost this compulsion to ring the emergency services. What she then says on the telephone to the emergency services is inexcusible.  She doesnt wake up in the morning wondering who to abuse next. The plan is to occupy her time, the plan is to alleviate her loneliness, the plan is to put her in touch with others who can provide help and support. Magistrates handed Taylor a  month community order and ordered her to pay pound court costs and an pound victim surcharge. Chairman of the bench, Wyn Clayton said: There are people all over the area waiting for ambulance for an emergency and whilst the crews are tied up coming out when it is not an emergency, those people can become victims of yours. You must take this on board. You are interfering with other people in the North Easts health care by making these calls. They must stop. The court heard that in future, emergency calls made by Taylor will be screened by her GP surgery first.

Edmund Zagorski died at approximately .pm local time just  minutes after a last minute of stay of exection was denied by the Supreme Court. He is the second man to die by electric chair in Tennessee since . According to witnesses, -year-old Zagorski was askedhe had any last words and he replied “let’s rock” shortly before the execution was carried out. According to local media Zagorski , who shot and slit the throats of two men in  during a drug deal, also “smiled and grimaced” as he was being prepared to die.  His lawyer Kelley Helen said she smiled at him and tapped her heart and later told the Tennessean: “I told him, when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.” Reporters who witnessed the scene said that the Extraction Team - the team that extract a prisoner from the holding cell to the chair - then put a sponge with saline solution on Zagorski’s head and secured it with two straps. A hooded shroud followed. Ms Henry said he appeared to wave then clenched his fists as the first , jolts of electricity flowed into his body for  seconds and that his little fingers appeared to “dislocated or broken” due to the force of straining against the straps. She also said there were signs he was still breathing before the second bolt was administered for  seconds. A doctor then appeared and confirmed that Zagorski was dead.  According to his lawyer, he made the following statement before he was taken to the execution chamber: First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don’t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I’m good. It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us, she added. He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him.  Zagorski chose the chair because he believed it wouldnt be as agonising as being killed by lethal injection. However, the man who built the chair, Fred Leuchter, had earlier revealed he feared it wouldnt work properly for Zagorskis execution and would be just as inhumane as the injection. The execution was initially set for October , but it was delayed because the state was not ready for an electrocution. For his last meal, Zagorski chose to dine on pickled pig knuckles and pigtails.  When he was previously on death watch, Zagorski chose not to order a last meal, but fellow death row inmates pooled their resources to give him a pizza dinner, the Tennessean also reported. Death row inmates are usually given to spend on a special meal before they are put to death. Zagorski was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of two men - John Dotson, , and Jimmy Porter,  - in .

The Carnival Sunshine had set off from Port Canaveral in Florida on Sunday evening, but a few hours later it started to tilt. Terried passengers began to scream and cry as tables slid across the deck and plates smashed to the ground, the New York Post reported. Photos posted to Twitter show shattered glass and trays strewn over the ship. One passenger, David Crews, told News  that at first he wasnt worried, but began to worry when the ship didnt right itself. He said: “I didn’t think anything of it, since it’s not uncommon for ships to rock back and forth. But it didn’t rock back. It kept leaning. “Plates and silverware started sliding off the tables. Then the tables themselves started to slide. Glasses and plates started to fall and shatter. At this point, it was pure chaos. Screams. Cries. Panic.”  Carnival say the ship was leaning for one minute and blamed a technical issue. More than two and a half thousand passengers were on the ship at the time, and some were so traumatised by the event that they reportedly flew home from the Dominican Republic instead of staying on the ship. Others took to Twitter to talk about the ordeal. Connie Calvert contacted Carnival directly, saying: Get me off this ship Carnival Sunshine. We just listed so bad that I am not comfortable being in this shop anymore.

Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas -

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The pair have performed all over Scotland as well as being broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland’s Classics Unwrapped multiple times.The afternoon started with the couple’s typical Spanish repertoire, a warm ‘Les Filles de Cadix’ that brought Bizet’s ‘Carmen’ to mind. Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody. The first act was finished with a light contrast of Scots songs including ‘Dream Angus’ and was met with murmurs of agreement in the audience.The second act began with a piece by Marco Ramelli by the name of ‘Moon’. The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm. Extra s would be .am, .am, .am, .pm and the .pm to Doonfoot.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnGlasgowAyrKilmarnockTroonPrestwickCumnockAyr NewsStagecoach"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13489965.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18066403.jpg","title":"partick thistle 0 ayr united","story":"NewsPartick Thistle , Ayr United  - Three things we learned at FirhillA Michael Rose header secured all three points for United in Glasgow as Ian McCalls men kept up their remarkable title challenge.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  OCT NewsMichael Roses header crosses the line to hand Ayr victory \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr Uniteds title bandwaggon kept on rolling in Glasgow as Michael Roses second half header earned a deserved three points for the visitors. Ian McCalls men, who saw two penalty appeals turned down, eventually gained their reward when Rose climbed to bullet home a Declan McDaid corner. It was no more than United deserved for another battling display on the road and keeps them firmly in touch with leaders Ross County at the summit. Heres three things we learned on another big afternoon for the Honest Men: Rose rises to the occasion Hes been immense for Ayr at the back this season but Michael Rose was the hero at the other end today and he climbed to power home Uniteds deserved winner. The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

Scottish Parliament yesterday .Universal Credit was introduced as part of the UK Governments overhaul of the welfare system.Critics say cuts to payments and widespread problems with its implementation have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been

amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything.

In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way.

They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them.

He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

Theresa May has already announced that there will be a Festival of Britain following Brexit to showcase British achievement and last month it was revealed that a special commemorative p piece will be minted. The UK Government, fortied by the press and the BBC, is already putting in place all the accoutrements that have previously served them well in distorting reality. The royal family will have received their orders. Irsquom expecting another couple of royal babies and Andrew and Fergie to renew their wedding vows. If Philip continues to be spared theyrsquoll maybe give him Manchester to go with Edinburgh.Those who smile condescendingly at such merrymaking in expectation of the day when the Brexit dream turns to dust and the people turn to a socialist government in despair, will have a long wait. Donrsquot delude yourselves. This day has been long in the making and represents the ultimate dream of the Conservative Party when all their strategies and grand designs evolved over centuries come to fruition. With Brexit what wersquore seeing is a distillation of the entire rationale and philosophy of the Tories and their approach to society.Previously, they had been able to conceal the selfishness and greed that has always been the essence of their belief structure with the help of an elaborate and sophisticated confidence trick. More than two centuries of military engagement produced the warrior heroes required to subscribe to the fiction that wersquove always been in this together. The royal family and lately a world-class broadcasting arm with global reach has ensured that the idea of unity, even amongst the worst rates of economic and health inequality, has been able to fly.When I was young I could never understand why a large percentage of the British working class could vote in the numbers required toa Conservative government. Itrsquos not the aristocrats and the affluent who are responsible for electing them ndash there simply arenrsquot enough of them ndash itrsquos the people who have suffered most at the hands of traditional Tory policies who continue to vote them in.For centuries the Tories fought hard to keep those whom they considered beneath them shut out from power and a share in Britainrsquos great wealth. Now the children and grand-children of the dispossessed are effectively keeping their ancestorsrsquo gaolers in power. Only a very powerful coalition of interests working closely together can maintain the lie required to hoodwink almost an entire class.Just as fear and suspicion of immigrants and foreigners was exploited by the architects of Brexit to achieve the desired result so the same targets will be used for shting the blame when the apocalypse dawns. There might have been a chance to achieve a workable Brexit deal with our European partners but this would have required an element of respect from the British negotiators. Instead, the Conservative deal-makers, from the outset, have branded the remaining  EU nations as obstructive and as consumed by a spirit of vengeance. By the time this softening-up process has concluded many in the UK will have been persuaded that the EU activated Article  and threw us out of their club.This is a convenient fiction which will come to serve a crucial purpose: it delivers the required scapegoat when the food and medicine shortages become apparent and when holidays and trips to Europe become an ordeal. The millions of EU citizens who reside here and any unfortunates from further afield will have a torrid time. This, in turn, feeds the other great obsession of the Brexiters: taking back our laws as well as our borders. The ability to frame workplace legislation weighted in favour of the corporate elites to make it easier to practice summary justiceto stop, search and imprison on a whim: this is the greatest prize of all.Next week Mike Leighs historical epic recalling the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in  will be released.

He is a fan. He was also a member of the Scottish Governmentrsquos advisory group on tackling sectarianism - and still advises authorities now. So he has seen this all before.Mr Lennon was one of several victims in what police sources describe as a ldquotoxic matchThe former Celtic player was hit in the head by a coin. The Hearts goalkeeper and match officials were also targeted. On Friday, Mr Lennon, now , and a veteran, understands the blank canvas he represents for friends and foes.ldquoMy thoughts are my own but people second guess them and most of the time get it totally wrong, he said. ldquoAgain this is the way you are portrayed, because I am an Irish Catholic who played for Celtic Irsquom this and that and the other, itrsquos their problem, not mine.His attack was also footballrsquos problem, and Scotlandrsquos.The heat is back in game, reckons Mr Rosie. On the pitch, neither of the two biggest clubs, Rangers and Celtic, are not quite where their supporters want them to be. But it is not just the Old Firm. Words have been ramped up on referees across the game.Big issues, such as bringing back alcohol to stadiums, are back in the news. So are Orange marches in Glasgow ,after an assault on a priest during one. A legislative attempt, always controversial, to tackle sectarianism at football has been repealed.ldquoFootball is never on its own. It is always mixed up with other stuff, ldquo Mr Rosie explains. And today that means issues are played out through social media in an endless loop of outrage and anger.ldquoI donrsquot think we can just point the finger at social media, the academic says. ldquoThese anxieties were always there. There were always racists and there were always bigots.Yet Mr Rosie sees some grounds for optimism. After previous flare-ups, such as the ground invasion at the Rangers v Hibs Cup Final and the ldquoShame Game between Rangers and Celtic in , that whataboutery was at fever pitch.ldquoThe clubs positioned themselves in very defensive ways, he says. This time round the tone has been dferent, with Hibs and Hearts issuing a joint statement. ldquoBoth were unequivocal, he said. ldquoThat is something we can build on. There is no love lost between these two clubs. But they have shown they can rise above that.ldquoIt would be good to see the SFA or the SPFL [footballrsquos two main governing bodies] show similar leadership. They have been talking about pyrotechnics for years. But flares are now seen routinely at big matches.ldquoThey were burning at Murrayfield on Sunday [when Hearts played Celtic in a cup tie] and at Tynecastle on Wednesday.ldquoJust imagine what would happena smoke bomb went off when crowds were going down stairs leaving a match.

The theory  Supporters will self-policethey think their team will have to play behind closed doors or be docked points. Scottish clubs, including Hearts and Hibs have voted against this. Mr Rosiersquos advisory group wanted such a scheme. ldquoIf not strictly liability, then what  he asked, not for the first time. ldquo We have never had an answer to that. I donrsquot think they have done anything.Fans groups have called in Henry McLeish, the former footballer - and first minister - to try and bring together stakeholders. Mr McLeish stressed the game was better than it has been but warned of ldquolingering concerns. He too points at clubs and governing bodies.He said: ldquoWhat needs to happen is that those in charge of the game have to take responsibility and not leave it to the police and the courts.Mr Rosie agrees: ldquoAs the police say, we have a problem with a lsquovery small minorityrsquo. But whatwe do not get across the message that that trouble is lsquonot onrsquo  Football is a rich sport and its leaders are paid a lot of money.

To be a parentin todayrsquos Scotland means accepting governmental regulation of your own family le in a way quite unknown to previous generations. Think, for example, of recent Government-approved efforts to stand between parents and their young children on the issue of gender self-identication the Governmentrsquos increasing regulation of parental discipline the unpopular drive to test early primary schoolers against their parentsrsquo wishes or the widely disliked Named Person scheme. In each of these, a paternalistic state projects its own programme and worldview into homes up and down the land, treating its own preferences and idiosyncrasies ndashhowever arbitrary and flimsy ndash as normative for us all. In the process, this ldquocorporate parent undermines each real-world familyrsquos authority in regulating its own affairs according to its own norms and values.If the Scottish Government wants to support parents, it should stop talking about itself ndash and crucially, acting ndash as a parliamentary parent to the nation. To speak of any state, politician, or party as a ldquocorporate parent is to make a basic category mistake. The family unit and the democratic state are quite dferent things. By confusing them, our Government imperils both.In many ways, the familyis a profoundly undemocratic institution. We do not choose our parents. Rather, they are chosen for us in the accident of birth, or in the process of adoption. For good or ill, our link to our parents is lelong and indelible. And despite the fact that we have not chosen them, our parentshave le-defining responsibilities over us. They are tasked with teaching us to love, moulding our characters, and giving us a view of the world. In taking up this herculean challenge, every parent carries out a common responsibility in a unique way. For that reason, the family next door will never be quite like your own, because every family unit isa one-off melting pot of histories ndash cultural, personal, and genetic ndash and hopes for the future. A family can run along lines that are compelling and unassailable to its own members, but that make little sense to their neighbours. And that is no bad thing, because the family, so undemocratic for its youngest members, is one of the most basic building blocks in a healthy democracy.The stateis very dferent to the family. It should be a thoroughly democratic institution. In a liberal democracy, we choose our politicians because they promise to represent us, in all our grassroots ersity. We elect them to do so ndash hopefully ndash because we already know who we are, not because we want them to decide who we must become. And should they fail to represent us well, our democracy also means we can vote them out. They are in office to represent their constituents as public servants, not corporate mothers or fathers.In its paternalism, our Government often talks about love as its motivation, or as the thing it will promote in Scotland. This is quite a responsibility to assume. As an example of this, the First Ministerrsquos speech highlighted her commitment to ldquoseeing love be the foundation and underpinning in what is wrapped around every child in Scotland. While this is a noble aim, it is not something a ldquocorporate parent, armed merely with statutes and political might, could ever achieve. Love is much better felt than telt. It cannot be created or kept alive by legislative action. Loversquos very nature makes plain that while politics is important in the promotion of human flourishing, its power is not infinite.If our politicians want to support Scottish parents and children, and promote love as a normal childhood experience, they must remember their limits. They are public servants and elected representatives of those whose social institutions ndash in this case, the family ndash have a power wholly dferent to their own. It is hard to promote love and encourage parentsthose parents feel that their state assumes they do not know how to parent, and where the uninvited ldquocorporate parent becomes an increasingly demanding figure in the home.As a child, I learned two civic virtues ndash one regarding the family, and the other, politics ndashwhich were ingrained at school and in the home. On the family, I was taught that ye cannae shove yer granny aff a bus for one simple reason: rsquocause shersquos yer mammyrsquos mammy. And on politics, I was taught to vote according to my own conscience at every available opportunity, because enfranchisement empowers the people. If those lessons were correct, a ldquocorporate parent is not just unnecessary. It is also an impossibility.Dr James Eglinton is Meldrum Lecturer in Reformed Theology at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"first phase of homes released in inverurie","story":"North east housebuilder CHAP Homes has opened its on-site sales cabin to enable keen buyers to reserve a new home at its Lochter development.With construction already underway, the Westhill-headquartered developer has joined local housebuilder Malcolm Allan on the prime -acre Lochter site.The development will ultimately be home to around  properties ranging from bungalows to large family homes and commercial premises.The first residents are expected to be able to move in next spring.Around ten years in the planning, Lochter is close to the newly-opened Uryside School, with the local academy, the town centre, and a large supermarket and retail park just a short distance away.Planning conditions attached to the development included supporting the delivery of the primary school, constructing pedestrian footpaths, and Malcolm Allan Housebuilders also built the link road connecting the B Oldmeldrum road to the B at Rothienorman.Colin Wood, technical manager at Malcolm Allan Housebuilders said: The Lochter development is a key part of our strategic plan for the long-term expansion of Inverurie to the east of the thriving town centre.“We are very pleased to have the first homes nearing completion after many years of planning.”CHAP Homes will build  homes on what it calls its “Crest of Lochter” development, ranging from two, three and four-bedroom detached and semi-detached houses.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmThough there won#t be as many fireworks as expected, this weekend, there#s still plenty to see and do.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach.

But budget leader councillor Alister Mackinnon said uncertainty would remain until the Scottish Government budget in mid-December.Cllr Mackinnon said: \"The exact gap is very uncertain as although the UK governmentrsquos budget has been announced, we will not have the Scottish Governmentrsquos budget and grant settlement figures until mid-December. We are hopeful however that the Scottish Government will pass on the additional money.\"Over the period   to   the Highland Council has already had to implement budget savings of pound. million and council tax rises of % in each of the last two years in order to deliver a balanced budget.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

It may be two months until the big day but Christmas is already taking shape in the centre of Edinburgh.It gets a little earlier each year. There was a time when Remembrance weekend marked the start of the transformation. After the red crosses were removed from Princes Street Gardens, the gingerbread houses of the Christmas Market started to appear.A few years ago, the Garden of Remembrance moved to allow for construction of a funfair ride but still not much happened before Halloween. Now the last week of October marks the start of the relentless commercialisation of the city centre. Is it a coincidence that the felling of trees in Princes Street Gardens was done just in time to create extra space for the Christmas market  It certainly seems convenient.But there is a more fundamental question facing anyone who lives in Scotland’s capital city. What’s it all for Edinburgh council will say it is for the benefit of locals and visitors but how do they know that  While the extension of the tram line to Newhaven seems to require endless consultation, who knows what the people of Edinburgh want the city centre to be : Some people might want it to be an entertainment theme park with non-stop festivals and endless opportunities to eat and drink. Others might just want it to be a place where people can live, work and shop unhindered. The point is, it would be nice to be asked. At the centre of it all is the Edinburgh Festival. For the month of August, the city becomes a stage and that is a wonderful thing.But the reward for putting up with all the congestion and disruption was traditionally  months of relative normality. Not any more. Nowadays Edinburgh’s Christmas consists of weeks of commercialisation with pop-up stalls where you can buy everything from sugar mice to wooden toys but mostly it is about selling booze.Edinburgh now has  festivals scattered across the calendar. The one gap that remained was after Hogmanay but even that is now being plugged by a new Burns Festival at the end of January which aims to attract thousands of participants to the city centre. That will make  festivals across the year. Unlucky for some. : Edinburgh’s Christmas market named best in UKWhile Edinburgh grows its reputation as a playground, the city centre population is falling as more and more inhabitants decide they cannot stand the endless disruption. Instead the city now has , short-term let properties listed on Airbnb.The row over fencing being erected around Princes Street Gardens for a concert this summer showed that increasing commercialisation and free access to the public realm is an increasing area of conflict.As one of the fastest growing cities in the UK, Edinburgh needs to decide how it wants the future to be. If we want the city to be a stage for non-stop commercial events, we are going about it the right way.Butwe want it to be a real living and working city for local people, we need to halt the race to make money from every space every month of the year.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4823708.1541164808!/image/image.jpg","title":"david cameron is wrong to think he can make comeback leader comment","story":"Former Prime Minister David Cameron reportedly wants toto politics because he is #bored#, but he should # at the very least # wait until the full effects of Brexit become clear.Shortly after David Cameron became Prime Minister in , a regular Ipsos-Mori poll on the most important issues facing Britain recorded its lowest ever score for the one that ultimately led to his downfall.Just one per cent of those surveyed felt the EU was a pressing concern and the figure was well below ten per cent when Cameron decided to call a referendum on Britain’s membership. Last month,  per cent rated the EU and Brexit as one of the UK’s most important issues, while economy, education and crime all took a back seat on less than  per cent. Such figures have led some to the belief that Cameron manufactured a national crisis out of nothing – apart from decades of infighting within the Conservative party – then departed too swtly, leaving others to clean up the mess.However, he is now reportedly planning ato politics as he is “bored s***less” – perhaps not the reason he would pitch to a Conservative constituency association’s selection committee – and has the post of Foreign Secretary in mind.

Alec Douglas-Home’s year-long stint as Prime Minister ended in defeat to Harold Wilson in the  general election, but he later served as Foreign Secretary under Edward Heath. William Hague was leader when the party lost the  election, but was Foreign Secretary from  to .However, while both politicians were damaged by failure, unlike Cameron these were not defeats of their own making. They were still well regarded by many in the party’s ranks. It goes without saying that the Brexiteers are not Cameron’s biggest fans, but Tory Remainers were hardly falling over themselves to welcome him back yesterday. The Conservative Home website’s daily news round-up relegated the story to an “And finally ...” item.That left it to Labour politicians to give the verdict, with Yvette Cooper MP tweeting: “You ripped up our closest international partnership. By accident. That makes you even worse than Boris Johnson.”And, given UK Government assessments that a no-deal Brexit could result in economic “Armageddon”, it does seem a bit rich for the person who may have put Britain on the path to that bleak future to be lining up one of the four Great Offices of State for himself.: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4823995.1541195559!/image/image.jpg","title":"search for scientists to be face of new 50 note","story":"Professors Stephen Hawking and Dorothy Hodgkin, the only British female to win a Nobel prize for science, are among early proposals for an eminent scientist to feature on the new Bank of England # note.Bank governor Mark Carney opened the public nominations yesterday, with the requirement of them being no longer living and from fields such as medical research, biology and astronomy.Professor Brian Cox was quick to nominate Prof Hawking, the renowned theoretical physicist who died in March, for inspiring “thousands of scientists” and “millions” of others.Royal Society president Venki Ramakrishnan said he would choose “remarkable inidual” Prof Hodgkin, the chemist who died in .“We can thank Dorothy for revealing the three-dimensional structures of many biologically important molecules such as penicillin, insulin and vitamin B, as well as inspiring several generations of leading crystallographers,” Dr Ramakrishnan added.Prof Hodgkin won the coveted prize for advancing the technique of X-ray crystallography, which is used to determine molecules’ D structures.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Saturday  Nov  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future. It is time to lay the foundations for reconciliation andhealing, and to open up a new phase of the peace process. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8686180.1540832893!/image/image.jpg","title":"budget chancellor philip hammond s boost for belfast region city deal","story":"Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has welcomed a #m commitment to bolster the proposed #bn Belfast Region City Deal.Chancellor Philip Hammond MP confirmed the signicant funding package as he announced details of the Autumn Budget on Monday.It came days after Belfast Region City Deal propositions were brought to Westminster as partner councils outlined their bid which could deliver around , new jobs.MEA Mayor, Cllr Lindsay Millar, said: “This £m commitment from the Chancellor is brilliant news for Mid and East Antrim and all six of the council areas involved in this vital bid.“Belfast Region City Deal sets out a -year plan to grow the economy, boost jobs and tourism, increasing skills, encouraging investment and developing infrastructure.“The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim.“This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.”MEA Council along with East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson held an engagement event at Westminster last Wednesday morning.

If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice. We are committed to keep that pledge.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"devine hoping to soar in russia","story":"BELFAST Gymnastics star, Ryan Devine departs for Russia this weekend to compete in the World Championships fresh from winning his maiden British title. The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"historical treasure trove revealed at clifton house","story":"THE BELFAST Charitable Society has uncovered a suitcase of letters and material from World War One while preparing for its autumn series of lectures. letters tell the story of Irish Pfficer Patrick Dixon’s le at the front during the war through correspondence with his parents in upper middle class Dublin.Paula Reynolds, CEO of the Belfast Charitable Society, said: “Our colleague and volunteer, Jim McFerran, has been tirelessly working his way through the Dixon family papers ensuring they are all documented and sorted appropriately.“When our Archive and Heritage Officer unearthed the letters we were astonished at first of all the amount of the material, as well as the condition of it.” Aaron McIntyre, Archive and Heritage Officer at Clton House, said: “These letters and material are of great importance and we are very excited about their signicance. It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time. We’d also like to find the descendants of Patrick Dixon and we would like help in tracing members of the Dixon or Wynne families who may be able to shed light on this incredible collection of war letters.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

Four of the five parties expressed frustration after the meeting and pressed Ms Bradley to convene multi-party talks. She said the meeting was initiated to brief the parties on the Northern IrelandBill.Ms Bradley said the most important thing was that she worked constructively with the parties. “Let’s stop the grandstanding, let’s stop the soundbites, now is the time we get back in the room and we get talking,” she said. “I want to see those parties taking an ownership, taking a responsibility and working with me so we can get a process that people can have confidence in and see that they will have devolved government in Stormont again in the near future.”UK Minister for the Cabinet Office David Lidington said there was no doubt that Brexit remaining unresolved was a factor when it came to trying to restore the Assembly.But he added: “I don’t think that needs to stop the efforts of the parties to move back towards power sharing.”Both Mr Lidington and Ms Bradley reiterated the UK Government’s “absolute commitment” to restore devolution.Ms Bradley said there was “no alternative”.Brexit negotiations and the absence of powersharing in Northern Ireland topped the agenda of the conference.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

Anything that screws up their trade is a problem for them.“There are some specic issues, the supply chains in Ireland, for example, go across the Irish frontier – you’ve got whiskey going one way and cream going the other to make Baileys.“If the Irish border is a problem then they have a serious problem as a company.” You can envisage a situation in which Guinness and Baileys, which are the two brands which are the most affected, are seriously disrupted.“In an extreme scenario, where there is no deal or a very bad deal, you could see these favourite products drying up.”He said there is widening cross-political backing for a so-called People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, which his party is campaigning for.A Diageo spokesman said: “We’ve made it clear that a frictionless border in Ireland is the best outcome for every business large and small.

Inside the bell are the remains of an iron ‘clapper’ which struck the side to make the bell sound, but as it has corroded the bell is now silent. The new display has been made possible through a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which has also enabled a community engagement programme around the item of shared heritage to take place.Dr Greer Ramsey, curator of archaeology at National Museums NI, explained the bell’s signicance, saying: “Along with religious books and the hooked staff or crozier carried by a bishop, bells became potent symbols of the Christian faith and even feature on stone carvings from this period.“Many hand bells were reputed to have connections to early saints so it was common for people to believe bells like this had miraculous powers.”To mark the recent discovery and display of the Ballyclog bell, there will be a special event at the Ulster Museum on November .Entitled, ‘Early Christian Ireland: Hand Bells, High Crosses, Music and More’, a series of talks will look at le in early Christian Ireland, at the use of church hand bells and at the identity of a mysterious musical instrument.

Allows @theresa_may to say the latter will never be needed.”He also said that: “Dublin now believes following news conference with [David] Lidington  Karen Bradley UK now more accepting of the [Joint Report]of last December ‘in full’.”What this would all appear to mean is that the UK is pressing ahead with the Irish border backstop. Now it is all a bit complicated . But nothing I have read has persuaded me that London is other than, at core, prepared to agree that Northern Ireland will always be entirely or largely in the European Union customs and regulatory space.The only remotely good news from a unionist point of view is thatthe UK is trying insofar as possible to keep Northern Ireland in the same customs arrangement as the rest of the UK.In other words, there will be no tarf barrier between the Province and Great Britain. This shows a level of determination to prevent an internal UK customs border, but there will be a regulatory one.The BBC reporter John Campbell grilled the Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on this point, during the latter’s visit to Northern Ireland yesterday, and he declined to be specic on whether there might be a regulatory border .Those who defend a backstop say that it only kicks inthere is no other UK-EU deal that prevents a hard Irish land border, but that misses the point because Dublin and the EU will clearly only accept a deal that has the effect of keeping in Northern Ireland in the EU customs and regulatory zone. There are some consolations in the shorter, darker days Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"What all this seems to confirm is that the UK will always be spineless in the face of anger from nationalist Ireland. London isdetermined to give greater assurance to a neighbouring jurisdictionthan it is to its own territory, even under a party that prides itself as Conservative and Unionist.Some experts say that a regulatory border doesn’t matter because the regulatory ergence between the UK and the EU will be minimal to non existent in any event but again, that is not the point.It is the UK declaration of intent that matters, because it has crumbled in the face of Dublin’s unwavering firm line. It also means that Brexit has signicantly weakened Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, evenit might be decades before the full implications of that become evident.But Arlene Foster was reported this week as sounding optimistic on an EU deal, saying: “Goodness, we have been here on a number of occasions and I think we are close to a deal that will work for Northern Ireland, that is what we want.”With all these ious reports and contrasting signals, late last evening I phoned DUP numbers that I have and got Sammy Wilson MP, just before this paper went to press. This is some hours after he spoke to our reporter Stephen Gamble see page . He said that he had not been at the meeting with Mr Raab but the party did not have the detail on what is being proposed. If it was a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, the deal with the Tories would be over he said. Also, the prime minister would lose a raft of Brexiter Tory MPs and some Scottish Tories too.“She won’t get it through,” he told me. “It isas simple as that.” • Ben Lowry @BenLowry is News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There are some consolations in the shorter, darker days• Ben Lowry: Unionism can’t afford to bury the talent it hasJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8692452.1541212904!/image/image.jpg","title":"unionism is hardly bursting with talent and cannot afford to bury that which it has  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Unionism is hardly bursting with talent and cannot afford to bury that which it hasJeff Dudgeon in the Belfast office of the News Letter, next to City Hall, where he serves as an Ulster Unionist councillor.

In  he was jailed in the Republic for RIRA membership.   Martina Anderson, Sinn Feins MEP is lobbying against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania His brother Michael was jailed in Lithuania in  for trying to buy a large haul of weapons for the RIRA. Liam has been facing extradition by Irish courts to Lithuania to face charges of involvement in the same plot and has up until now been backed by Republican Sinn Fein.But now Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson has written to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling on him “to protect the human rights” of Mr Campbell. Ms Anderson said: “I met with the family of Liam Campbell who is currently facing extradition to Lithuania about their concerns over the implications for his human rights. “The Supreme Court already ruled against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania as it found that prison conditions there could breach his right to freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is utter hypocrisy for Sinn Fein to demand the pursuit of British soldiers through the courts, whilst at the same time intervening to demand that terror suspects be given a free pass“There is a concern that,extradited, he could face a y period in detention before his case comes to trial in conditions that have been criticised by the UN’s Committee on Torture.” “I have now written to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressing my concern about Liam Campbell’s case and asking him to meet me as a matter of urgency to discuss it.”She has also written to the EU’s Commissioner for Human Rights, she said.But DUP East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson noted he had been found liable for the Omagh bombing.    Real IRA member Liam Campbell pictured at the High Court in  where he was appearing in connection with the Omagh bomb.

Secretary of State Karen Bradley But the parties emerged after just  minutes to deliver scathing criticism of Karen Bradley’s handling of the process.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the meeting had been a box-ticking exercise, and labelled it “badly briefed and badly advised”.He said Ms Bradley must now either take “ownership of the process”, or introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland from Westminster.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the meeting as a “complete and utter waste of time”.“It is quite clear that the British Government are totally unprepared to take the necessary next steps to get powersharing restored.“Today is an embarrassing day for the Secretary of State. Quite simply, it is not her job to wait for a ‘consensus’, her job, alongside the Tanaiste, is to kickstart the talks process.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said the restoration of devolution was now further away than it had been when talks collapsed in February.Branding the briefing “counter-productive”, she added: “I think relationships between parties, and indeed the secretary of state, are possibly now at an all-time low.”The Sinn Fein delegation gave a short statement to the media after the meeting, before leaving without taking questions.Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd accused the government of “treating large sections of this society with utter and complete contempt”.The DUP has not yet given a reaction to the meeting.Fred Reynor: Second World War veteran to be laid to rest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mrs Bradley said she intended to brief the parties on the Northern IrelandBill, which is intended to allow time and space for political parties to agree ato powersharing government.She added: “I want to get those parties in a room together and really go through with them how this act will deliver for them.“But they have to do the right thing, come back into government, and I want to see them do that as soon as possible.”Devolved government at Stormont has been mothballed since January  following a breakdown in relations between the DUP and Sinn Fein.Numerous attempts at talks to agree to theof the Executive have ended in failure.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought.

Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre.
