The Department of Education, irrespective of whatever minister is in charge, is generally more cautious and conservative than other government departments and teacher unions tend to resist radical change as well.And yet change – often led by schools and teachers themselves – is happening.One of the most notable initiatives in Irish education, DCU Changemaker Schools Network, which is run from the university’s institute of education, is holding a conference on innovative schools in Ireland on March 24th.“The pandemic has revealed the fault lines in traditional education systems and created an opportunity to reimagine education for 21st century learning,” says Fiona Collins, network co-ordinator of the DCU Changemaker Schools Network.Collins has been seconded to the DCU School of Policy Practice from her role as principal of Francis Street School, which is part of the network.“We support schools to network and foster the skills of empathy, creativity, leadership and teamwork,” Collins explains.“We support teachers and students in areas such as student voice, agency and participation as well as social innovation and active and engaged citizenship to address societal challenges such as inequality, climate change and mental health, assisting teachers and schools too.”Here, we profile just some of the schools involved in the initiative:During the pandemic, we all sought ways to make the most of the outdoors and, for many of us, that shift has become permanent.Scoil Bhríde in Shantalla – a Deis school just 15 minutes from the shores of Galway Bay and the docklands in Galway city – set up a “sea school” during the pandemic to ensure the children could avail of the amenities on their doorstep and get outside while still being within their five kilometres.Students here learn about marine life and conservation, marine biology, rigging and water safety, the effects of climate change and the skills of seafaring, sailing and fishing. They also learn about the history of traditional crafts and how to build a traditional fishing boat and they catch their own fish before cooking and eating it.It’s a hands-on, experiential approach that touches on areas of the curriculum including science, geography, history, art and maths.The school has also become a dyslexia-friendly school which focuses on the talents and strengths of the students as well as addresses the emotional complexities of dyslexia, with creativity in all disciplines as well as an emphasis on coding, self-esteem and emotional wellbeing.Empathy is one of the core values of the DCU Changemaker initiative, and the school has put inclusion at its core.“In November 2014 we established our first autism early-intervention class for preschool children, and we now have two early-intervention and four school-age classes,” says teacher Louise Redington.“Inclusion of autism-spectrum pupils with the mainstream is important to us, and the establishment of our autism centre has enhanced the learning experiences, empathy skills and social awareness of each and every member of our school community.”Student and teacher leadership at the school is fostered with an active student council.One of the suggestions from the children in the student council – to build an outdoor classroom made of recycled materials – was taken up, increasing the amount of outdoor learning, including growing vegetables in a polytunnel.Last summer, they were crowned “Incredible Edibles” champion after producing a bumper crop and successfully hatching chickens. As part of all this, the children learn about farm safety.“The teachers lead by example in how they act, speak and behave, and take on leadership roles in and out of the classroom,” says Redington. “Changemaker schools means we show empathy, creativity, teamwork and leadership in all we do.”No stranger to radical change, the school was the first to break the Irish norm of religiously controlled education school principal Miriam Hurley says they are constantly open to innovation.“In 2015, one of our teachers brought the idea of a forest school and, because Changemaker schools are open to listening to anyone with a good idea, we took it on.“We take the children out in all weather bar storms, and our families know to dress them for all weathers. It’s a very structured initiative that involves team games at the start, then free play within boundaries, and relaxation time.“We’ve had Halloween events, tea ceremonies, storytelling and inspiration from nature drawn from Irish folklore, and teamwork is a vital part of it all. There is huge creativity in it, with children using blackberries to make dye and landscape art, all the while learning about camouflage, sliding, hills and trees. They don’t even notice that they’re learning.”The school also places an emphasis on empathy, using restorative practices as part of its anti-bullying programme. This involves a teacher listening to both children in a dispute before bringing them together to hear each other.“Getting to know other Changemaker schools has been inspirational,” says Hurley. “While it can be a challenge to operate in an under-resourced education system, it is affirming to see children growing into critical thinkers and problem-solvers.”Our Lady’s and St Mochua’s, ArmaghThe only Northern Irish school in the DCU Changemaker initiative, this school places an emphasis on entrepreneurship.“For us, it means being open-minded and willing to embrace change,” says principal Gary Farrell.But, ultimately, Farrell says, DCU Changemakers means that every child takes on leadership roles, whether on their eco-committee or the pupil leadership team.They have adopted Roots of Empathy, an internationally acclaimed programme which sees children get to know a newborn baby whose parent brings them to the school over the course of a year and which has been proven to build up empathy.“Creativity is key too, and we’ve developed this in our children through digital storytelling and animation,” says Farrell. “Ultimately, all of these skills are what children need for adulthood.”Opening in 2006, St Ultan’s is a one-of-a-kind education and social care campus.“We’ve developed a system of integrated care and education through which our eclectic team – which includes teachers, special-needs assistants, social care workers, early-years practitioners, therapeutic staff and a wide range of service providers from each part of our campus – meet to discuss the needs of our children and collaborate on which responses we can offer,” says Gary Jones, school principal and campus manager.“This is not the typical way of working in Irish schools or youth services but the benefits greatly outweigh the challenges of developing a new model of working.“Most children arrive as infants and we get to know them and their families and provide the supports they need to flourish as they grow into toddlers and transition across the hall to the primary school. No child here needs to be hungry or lacking in confidence, and we cook meals on site as well as offer a range of additional activities including sport and music.”Despite its small size, this two-teacher school in west Cork has big ambitions when it comes to creative projects.The two classrooms much of spent the school year separated from each other due to Covid-19 restrictions.However, the school staff came up with an innovative project that would allow the students to work together while staying apart – a mural of plastic bottletops.Pupils, staff and the wider community collected some 12,000 bottle tops to create a mural of their community which stands at 24ft by eight feet.The mural shows the view from the playground of Ballineen Bridge with Enniskeane village and Ballineen village on either side. It features some of the wildlife in the area such as herons and swans.This mural, which turned rubbish into art, shows how a project can evolve even during lockdowns and how to be creative during a time of great challenge in schools."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"In Richard Nairn\u0026rsquos second book on the Irish coastline, he has bad news to shareStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"work on charlemont metro station begins before planning application for line lodged","story":" Construction work on the metro’s terminus at Charlemont alongside the building of an office block has already started. Photograph: Alan Betson Construction work costing €12.5 million has gone ahead on the controversial Charlemont link station near Ranelagh, Dublin, even though transport authorities have yet to seek planning permission for the rail line.However, work on the metro’s terminus at Charlemont has already started, which local residents say is pre-empting the statutory planning process and “locking in” the route for the line.The metro route published in 2016 was to run from Swords to Sandyford with a stop at Charlemont, currently served by the Luas Green line. US investment firm Hines sought planning permission in 2017 to redevelop the former Irish Nationwide Building Society headquarters on Grand Parade near the Luas stop. A condition of permission granted in April 2019 saw Hines required to enter into an agreement with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) to accommodate a potential metro or light rail “on, at, or near the site”. Future optionsThe NTA had two months earlier decided to shelve the southern leg of the route, but said it would terminate the line at Charlemont and investigate future options for the southside. It said last November that any southside rail connection would not be built until after 2042, and would likely be a Luas rather than a metro line. Planning permission would be sought this year for the link from Swords to Charlemont, it said. Some 40 residents associations from across south Dublin have repeatedly called for the line to terminate in the city centre rather than at Charlemont, with motions passed at South Dublin County and Dublin City Council recently calling on transport authorities to identify a city centre terminus for the line.However, work has been ongoing since last year on the underground station at Charlemont ahead of the planning application. Enabling workA spokesman for TII said Hines had undertaken enabling work to allow a station to be developed at this this location in the future.Ciarán Black, of the CharlemontDartmouth Community Group, said that by commissioning construction of the station’s “exoskeleton” the transport authorities had “acted beyond their powers” and were “predeterming” the outcome of the planning process. He said construction took place “without ever notifying the public” and no site notice or advertisement related to metro works was ever displayed and no drawings were submitted as part of any application.Mr Black said sticking with the Charlemont terminus would prevent the future development of a metro to serve potential housing at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines, as well as Rathgar, Rathfarnham and the southwest city suburbs.“Whether intentional or not, the NTA is predetermining and locking-in their chosen route to all future decisions about metro extensions on the south side of Dublin.”A spokesman for the NTA said the Charlemont terminus “future-proofs” an extension of the metro along the Green line or southwest of the city. A spokesman for Hines said it has acted in line with its planning permission and put in place the requisite enabling works required for the site.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish Labour party leader Keir Starmer has called for a relationship between Britain and Ireland based on equal respect that acknowledges both governments’ roles as co-guarantors of the Belfast Agreement rather than simply consultees.He said the relationship had been dominated by Brexit in recent years but it had a rich and long history that was bigger than the current dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol.“And I felt they were some of the most uplifting years in my working life because there was so much progress going on, so much change going on. You could feel it, you could see it, you could sense it when you were there. And that has given me a really strong sense of the importance of that partnership.“The relationship requires respect, equal respect and understanding of what it means to be a country and to have that status, that friendship, that relationship and that respect.”Mr Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party Irish Society’s St Patrick’s Day reception at the London Irish Centre in Camden, which is in his constituency of of Holborn and St Pancras. Other speakers included Trade Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O’Grady, Labour MP Conor McGinn, who chairs Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain and Adrian O’Neill, Ireland’s ambassador to Britain.Mr O’Neill said that this year’s St Patrick’s Day events in London had been conceived as a celebratory return to personal contact after two years of the coronavirus pandemic but they had been overshadowed by the war in Ukraine.“To some extent, we have to kind of dial it down a little bit or at least recognise that while we are enjoying this opportunity to meet in person and celebrate all the things that we really cherish, our democracy, our human rights, our independence, sovereignty, all of those core values that they are absolutely now being trampled on in Ukraine,” he said.“In Ireland, we’re working very, very closely with the UK, with the US with like-minded partners in the Security Council of the UN, within the EU, the Human Rights Council in Geneva, the International Criminal Court, using all the mechanisms at our disposal to isolate and increase pressure on Putin and his regime.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Phenomenal success of Nigerian artists is bringing both opportunities and criticismAuthors are tackling topics from transgender rights to Islamic extremism, and picking up plenty of awardsTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britains borders open can let","story":"Here\u0027s a paradox: Britain is a great country, say MPs, because it opens its doors (David Davis), but a mean one because Tory toffs don\u0027t want to let anyone in (Tim Farron). If you back the Nationality and Borders Bill, Mr Farron told the Commons, “you are voting for deaths in the Channel!” - and though Andrew Mitchell, leader of a doomed Conservative rebellion, didn\u0027t go that far, he agreed it was unkind and expensive.Rather than processing refugees in Albania, he said, it would be cheaper to “house them at the Ritz and send the under-18s to Eton”. And wouldn\u0027t that mess with the Left\u0027s head? They might think twice about open borders if the children were groomed to become the next Tory prime minister.To defend this “utterly obscene” piece of legislation (to quote a one-star review by the SNP), the Government sent in the lovely but unexciting Thomas Pursglove. As the MP for Corby, land of the trouser press, rattled through the 54 amendments sent by the Lords in a tone that sounded, perversely, like he was enjoying himself, Mitchell wandered the backbenches trying to foment a mutiny among those still awake - before plopping down insolently in the middle of the Chamber, waggling his red socked-foot provocatively like a red rag to a Bill.Pursglove finished. The rebellion began, an orgy of cross-bench agreement that Tory liberals and opposition socialists pretended to find surprising, but they\u0027re always of one mind on borders. Let asylum seekers work, said John McDonnell (that way he can tax \u0027em, the crafty old commie). Process them in the UK, said David Davis, where it is humane. Australia tried offshoring, said the SNP, and it didn\u0027t work. Oh yes it did, said Thomas Hunt of Ipswich, noting that the number of those dying at sea fell. Oh no it didn\u0027t, said Double-D, claiming that the scheme was judged costly and dangerous, adding that, in his view, what actually made a difference was “pushing back” the refugees - a policy the Left thinks is tantamount to murder.So, what are we supposed to do?When someone knocks on your door, say the wets, and begs for help, you don\u0027t turn them away. Amen. But if they pay a thug to break in via a downstairs window, says the Government, you\u0027ve a right to complain.We need “control!” barked Sir John Hayes: yes to safe routes, no to the illegal. But while this Bill clamps down on criminals, it doesn\u0027t actually provide for new safe routes, which is akin to sticking a sign on your lawn that reads “All Welcome!”, while covering the garden path with mines and barbed wire.Mitchell noted that over 80 per cent of those entering Britain “illicitly” in 2021 came from countries that have no legal route. They\u0027re not dodging the forms. They\u0027re rolling the dice.The amendments were defeated, and the Government will be labelled heartless for trying to enforce the law, which is its basic job. “Disraeli observed,” said Sir John, “that it is easier to be critical than correct”. How true. But if only the correct course of action, namely protecting the border, didn\u0027t leave one feeling just a little bit crummy.More from NewsUkraine-Russia latest news: Russia could use nuclear weapons if facing \u0026#39existential threat\u0026#39, says KremlinLet civil servants work around the school run, says unionCouple charged with manslaughter over death of morbidly obese daughterTriple whammy of tax rises set to cost every adult £1,000 a year extraClimate change on the back burner as Liz Truss wants aid spent on women and girlsSNP costs taxpayers £150,000 after failed attempt to ‘redefine’ women to include transgender peopleMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"chris mullin birmingham six journalist reveal identity ira","story":"A journalist who helped exonerate the Birmingham Six will not have to hand over his notes of an interview with an alleged plotter of the 1974 bombings to police following a legal battle.West Midlands Police attempted to use terrorism legislation to force Chris Mullin to disclose unredacted notes he made when interviewing a man – identified only as AB – who claimed to have been responsible for planting IRA bombs that devastated two Birmingham pubs.The legal battle centres on a long-running controversy stemming from Mr Mullin’s reporting in the 1980s on what became one of Britain’s worst miscarriages of justice.Six innocent men served nearly 17 years behind bars after being wrongly convicted of IRA bombings on two pubs in Birmingham, which left 21 people dead in November 1974.Mr Mullin helped expose the wrongful convictions through his reporting, including the 1986 book, Error of Judgment, which allegedly saw him speak to one of the actual perpetrators, on the condition he protected their identity, which he has done for decades since.The alleged plotter has previously been named in media reports as Michael Patrick Reilly, now 67. He was arrested by West Midlands Police and questioned at a police station in Belfast in November 2020, before being released under investigation.At the time, Mr Reilly’s solicitor said his client denied the allegations, including that he had any role in - or knowledge of - the pub bombings.Mr Reilly was named as a key suspect in the bombings in a documentary by ITV Exposure in 2018, which saw him deny involvement in the atrocity when confronted by a journalist in the car park of a west Belfast supermarket. An anonymous IRA terrorist who gave evidence to an inquest examining the deaths in 2019 said he did not remember Mr Reilly when naming others involved. On Tuesday morning, Mark Lucraft, the Recorder of London, said he did not believe there was sufficient public interest to force Mr Mullin to disclose his notebooks as it did not override the journalist’s right to protect his sources.Mr Lucraft said there would need to be a “clear and compelling case that there is an overriding public interest that would displace Mr Mullin’s right to protect his confidential journalistic source.“The journalism in issue was of the highest public interest value exposing serious failings on the part of the criminal justice system which resulted in the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of six innocent men,” he told the Old Bailey.“On this issue I do not find an overriding public interest to displace the journalistic source protection right. I decline to grant the production order sought.”Investigators hoped the material would help identify a surviving member of the IRA gang responsible for the atrocity.Mr Mullin said he was “grateful” for the judge’s decision.“The right of a journalist to protect his or her sources is fundamental to a free press in a democracy. My actions in this case were overwhelmingly in the public interest.“They led to the release of six innocent men after 17 years in prison, the winding up of the notorious West Midlands Serious Crimes Squad and the quashing of a further 30 or so wrongful convictions.“This case also resulted in the setting up a Royal Commission which, among other reforms, led to the setting up of the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the quashing of another 500 or more wrongful convictions.”Former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale also welcomed the judgment.“Whilst it is important that every effort is made to identify those who were responsible for the horrendous bombing in Birmingham, it is also essential that journalistic sources are protected if we are to continue to have a properly free press and therefore I do believe that this judgment is the right one,” he said.The relatives of the victims have called on police to prosecute those responsible for the IRA terror attack, and accused the force of using a court battle to distract from its failures.Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was killed in the atrocity, suggested the legal battle was a “cloaking device... to deflect” away from police failures to secure convictions in recent years and urged the force to pursue a prosecution based on what they already know.“We want truth, justice and accountability,” she told The , adding that the court’s decision went as the victims’ families had expected. The news that police will not be given the documentation they requested is likely to dash hopes that the people responsible for the bombings will be prosecuted.Several men were convicted of the bombings in the 1970s, but were later freed from prison after doubts were raised about the initial investigation and prosecution.Mr Mullin was taken to court by West Midlands police who used the Counter Terrorism Act to argue that he must provide all documents relating to his work, including interviews with men who apparently confessed to being responsible.He had previously provided redacted notes, but in court, the barrister representing the police argued that the full documents needed to be disclosed to confirm the identity of the bomber.During hearings in February, James Lewis QC, who represented the police, told the Old Bailey that officers were confident they knew the identity of the alleged bomber, but the interview notes were crucial for a prosecution.He said that the journalist had conducted a four-hour interview with a man identified only as AB and made contemporaneous notes.The barrister described the confession from AB as voluntary, accurate and reliable, adding: “In short it is a full confession to the murders.”He pointed out that this was not a third-party disclosing information in the public interest. “This is the murderer himself confessing,” he said.Reporting restrictions are in place to stop the naming of two men in connection with the bombings. Mr Mullin has argued that forcing such a disclosure would be a breach of the principle that journalists are entitled to protect their sources. It is understood that the journalist removed the front page of his red notebook which detailed the inidual’s name and address in the mid 80s shortly after the interview took place, but he believes there are details in the notebook which could identify his sources if they were to be disclosed.  More from NewsCraven politicians are too scared to confront the true cost of electric carsUkraine-Russia latest news: Russia could use nuclear weapons if facing \u0026#39existential threat\u0026#39, says KremlinLet civil servants work around the school run, says unionCouple charged with manslaughter over death of morbidly obese daughterTriple whammy of tax rises set to cost every adult £1,000 a year extraClimate change on the back burner as Liz Truss wants aid spent on women and girlsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid inquiry ignores children paid ultimate price pandemic","story":"The Children’s Commissioner has warned that the Covid inquiry’s failure to address social services will ignore the “terrible, ultimate price” that some children paid during the pandemic. The inquiry, which is being led by Baroness Heather Hallett, will examine the preparedness, capacity and resilience of the NHS, as well as the procurement of PPE, the impact of coronavirus on health staff and the use of “do not attempt resuscitation” notices. However, while the draft terms of reference for the inquiry have been published, they include just one reference to education and do not cover social services. The words “child” or “children” are not used.The public is able to submit responses on the UK Covid-19 Inquiry website until midnight on April 7.Responding to the publication of the terms of reference, Dame Rachel de Souza, Children’s Commissioner for England, called for the inquiry’s scope to be widened to explore the impact on social services because of a number of harrowing high-profile cases which “shocked us all and where the strictures of managing the pandemic evidently played a role”. Her comments come following the deaths of 16-month-old Star Hobson, who died of “catastrophic injuries” inflicted on her at her West Yorkshire home in September 2020.Following a seven-week trial, Star’s mother Frankie Smith, 20, and her partner, Savannah Brockhill, 28, were convicted over her death.Five referrals were made to social services by concerned friends and family in the eight months leading up to Star’s death - but the authority repeatedly closed the case.A joint statement from safeguarding agencies in Bradford said they “deeply regret” missing warning signs in Star’s case.The case drew parallels with that of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, who was murdered in Solihull borough in June 2020. The six-year-old boy suffered a campaign of abuse and was left with an unsurvivable brain injury at the hands of his father and his partner. In December, Emma Tustin was jailed for at least 29 years for Arthur’s murder while her partner, Arthur’s father Thomas Hughes, was given a 21-year sentence for manslaughter.The pair’s trial heard Arthur had been poisoned with salt by Tustin and subjected to regular beatings by both adults. He was also given punishments such as being denied food and drink and being made to stand for hours alone in a hallway.During the trial, it emerged social workers from Solihull Council had visited the boy’s home in the months before he died and found no issues, despite relatives raising concerns.Commenting on the Government’s Covid inquiry, Dame Rachel told The : “I have spent my first year in this role committed to putting the voice of children at the heart of recovery from the pandemic. “During it, many children had significant setbacks in their lives which I am confident we can, and we must, help them recover from but also help them flourish into the future. “That sacrifice they made to keep us all safe should be acknowledged. They have told me, in unprecedented numbers, they want recovery, and they want support in getting back to normal.“I think it’s what this generation deserves, to be heard and to be helped. It is also true that during this period some children paid a terrible, ultimate price, in cases that have since shocked us all and where the strictures of managing the pandemic evidently played a role.“I would be keen to see the experiences of children, and the effects on children’s social care, more widely considered than the current draft of the inquiry’s parameters currently reflects.”The  has been running a campaign calling on ministers to put children first as the country recovers from its Covid lockdowns.It comes after a group of MPs, led by Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Commons education select committee, called for the closure of schools to form a “significant part” of the Covid Inquiry.In a letter sent to Baroness Hallett, the MPs also asked for the impact of the pandemic on young people’s mental health and on their “life chances” to be considered.Anna Edmundson, head of policy and public affairs at the NSPCC, added: “The lockdowns left some vulnerable children and young people trapped in violent homes with little means of escape from the increased threat of domestic, physical and sexual abuse.“It is vital the difficulties, hardship and suffering faced by the younger generation over the past couple of years are fully examined and reflected upon in the Covid Inquiry, with the learnings that come out of it being used by Government to help those in need now and to ensure we are better prepared in the future.”       Helen Hayes MP, Labour’s Shadow Minister for Children and Early Years, added that throughout the pandemic “the Government has treated children as an afterthought”. “Vulnerable children were let down time and again, with huge impacts on learning, mental health, and wellbeing. The government’s dither and delay simply means this inquiry is starting far too late.”A Government spokesperson said: “Following the publication of the draft Covid Inquiry terms of reference, there is now an ongoing period of public engagement and consultation being led by Baroness Hallett to inform further changes to the terms before they are finalised.

In the United States, his reception was even more rapturous, with Nancy Pelosi performing a toe-curling poem on St Patrick’s Day, written by Bono, that compared him to Ireland’s patron saint (“he drove out the snakes with his prayers”).Not so in Israel. When Zelensky first asked to address the Knesset, the speaker, Mickey Levy, was hardly effusive. It might be tricky, he reportedly said, as the Knesset was undergoing renovations. This underlined Israel’s cautious stance on Ukraine. With Russian forces holding the balance of power in Syria, where Israeli pilots carry out regular raids, Jerusalem must tread with care.Nonetheless, Israel voted to condemn Russian aggression against Ukraine at the UN. And when Zelensky did finally deliver his speech to the Knesset on Sunday, it was packed. Even Benjamin Netanyahu attended. The Ukrainian leader has developed a trademark technique of citing imagery specific to his audience. He evoked Churchill when addressing Britons, for instance, and 911 when he spoke to the Americans. Each time these examples aided his argument. In the Knesset, however, Zelensky displayed the limits of his good judgement. His evocation of the Holocaust triggered a backlash. Yoaz Hendel, the Israeli communications minister, tweeted: “The war is terrible, but the comparison to the horrors of the Holocaust and the Final Solution is outrageous.” Others urged that Israel be judged in a broader, regional context. No Middle Eastern country other than Israel has condemned Russia. Indeed, ever since the Cold War, the Arab world has sought to maintain close relations with Russia while Israel has cleaved to the United States. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 could be seen as a proxy war between the two superpowers, with military supplies streaming in on both sides.Fast forward to this point and Israel has provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine, including the first foreign field hospital, which is being opened this week. It has also waived visa requirements for Ukrainians. In Zelensky’s eyes, however, this is not enough. In the Knesset address, he criticised Israel for not being more aggressive in its support. “You can mediate between nations but not between good and bad,” he said. “We can ask why we can’t receive weapons from you, why Israel has not imposed powerful sanctions on Russia or is not putting pressure on Russian business?” There may well be some truth to such criticism. Israel still refuses to supply weapons. But the country\u0027s room for manoeuvre is restricted by realpolitik, however much its heart weeps for Ukraine. National interest is a difficult imperative to ignore in any circumstance. But with a country surrounded by nations that do not believe it should even exist, it becomes a matter of survival. Perhaps Zelensky\u0027s failure to recognise this is what killed the mood most in the Knesset. Jake Wallis Simons is Editor of the Jewish Chronicle More from NewsCraven politicians are too scared to confront the true cost of electric carsUkraine-Russia latest news: Russia could use nuclear weapons if facing \u0026#39existential threat\u0026#39, says KremlinLet civil servants work around the school run, says unionCouple charged with manslaughter over death of morbidly obese daughterTriple whammy of tax rises set to cost every adult £1,000 a year extraClimate change on the back burner as Liz Truss wants aid spent on women and girlsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits face 8 price rises","story":"Brits face % price rises in supermarkets this summer, says Cabinet minister for foodGeorge Eustice, the Cabinet minister for the UKs food supply, pointed to warnings that food price inflation could rise to % - and said chicken will be affectedA customer passes a sales display of oranges and pineapples in the fruit and vegetable section of an Asda supermarket Image: Bloomberg via Getty ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar |commentsBrits face % food price rises in the supermarket this summer, the Environment Secretary declared today.

The Governmentaposs lawyers in written submission argued that there is no principle of common law stopping ministers or officials communicating in a way they consider appropriate.They continued: There is nothing intrinsically novel or distinct about the use of private email accounts, instant messaging and private devices.It was added: The claims advanced are detached from the reality of current working practices. The modern working age is defined by instant and fast-paced communications.This has only been enhanced by the pandemic, and the consequent legal requirements and the Government guidance, which necessitated the need for remote working, and in which context increased the need for fast communication across Government on urgent matters.Ministers and officials need to engage speedily and effectively with others.They went on to criticise the unreality of the claims made, saying they insulate the Government from the modern world.In their separate claim against Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Good Law Project is expected to argue over the use of non-Government communication channels.As part of a dferent claim over millions of poundsapos worth of antibody test contracts, the GLP previously asked the High Court to order searches of former health secretary Matt Hancockaposs Government email accounts and his non-Government communications systems used for Government business - thought to include WhatsApps.The claims are due to be heard over three days before Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Johnson, with a decision expected at a later date.The hearing continues.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Sarah HarrisonDonald TrumpBoris JohnsonNadhim ZahawiWhatsAppConservative PartyAtc Inc.AppsCivil servantsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is expected to tell Brits how the Government will help them get through the looming cost of living crisis. He has hinted he may cut fuel duty by up to p per litre, with forecourt prices soaring since Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine.The Labour leader backed the move – and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to drive down soaring energy bills.He said: “Everybody is talking about how they’re feeling the pinch. They want to know that the Government is hearing them, that it’s going to do something about it”. He added: “I think the simple things are a windfall tax on oil and gas companies who’ve made more profit than they expected, use that to bring down bills.  “If the Government is going to actually do something about fuel duties, then, of course, we will support that because I think, for most people, this is such a dficult situation.” As households and businesses struggle, No  admitted that the Government’s energy security strategy had been delayed again to next week. Mr Starmer also said a planned National Insurance rise was the “wrong tax at the wrong time”.There is speculation Mr Sunak could scrap the rise for lower-paid workers by raising the threshold it starts to be paid at. The Resolution Foundation said boosting benefits would bring nearly four times more support to lower-earning families than scrapping the NI rise. It emerged last night pensions could rise by more than % in April  after the DWP insisted it “remains committed” to bringing back the triple lock – despite inflation rising.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey will base the increase on average wages, .%, or September’s CPI inflation figure – whichever is highest.It will likely bring a bumper rise for pensioners next spring - but only after hefty real-terms cuts this year. The Resolution Foundation has said inflation could hit .% by September, higher than last year though still below a peak next month of .%. That would lead to a pensions rise of £ a week.  But the think-tank blasted the “rollercoaster ride” and urged ministers to ease pressure now Parents are also being squeezed by rising childcare costs and a drop in places, according to the charity Coram Family and Childcare. It found the UK-average price of  hours of care a week for an under two in nursery is £.. More than one in five people fear financial pressures will drive them into problem debt this year, debt charity StepChange found. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth claimed energy price rises will cause low earners and retirees to either “starve or freeze”. Below are six announcements expected on Wednesday: p fuel duty cut predictedFuel duty was frozen in October’s Budget for a th year in a row. But Tory MP Robert Halfon said it is “vital” it is now reduced as prices soar due to the Ukraine war. Mr Sunak has hinted it could be cut – amid speculation of p a litre. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour will not vote against a cut but warned that p may not “rise to the scale of the challenge”.Inflation set to peak at .% Inflation is set to peak at .% in April after the Russian invasion of Ukraine made it even worse. Officials fear it could go even higher, beating the .% rate of . Some warn it could hit %. This will blow out of the water October’s forecasts that inflation would peak at .% this year and could rise to .%. It will mean more expensive food and goods, hitting the poorest hardest. National insurance to rise to .% National Insurance will rise from % to .% from April and will be paid by anyone earning over £, a year, up from the £, a year it is paid at now. There’s speculation the Chancellor could raise this threshold, taking some of the lowest earners out of paying. One Tory said: “If it’s about pride, they can now say Ukraine is the reason they need to change course.”Benefits to go up by .% Benefits will go up just .%, as little as £. a month on Universal Credit. In October the Chancellor cut UC for millions by £ a week.Pensions will also rise by .%. In a Budget “rabbit out of the hat” in October, he handed more generous benefits to . million working families by cutting the UC taper rate from p to p.But this only helps those who work, not the sick or unemployed.MoD budget to be increased Westminster sources told the Sunday Mirror the Chancellor is planning to raise the £bn MoD budget.

It is set to invest more in renewable and nuclear power and aim for more oil from places like Saudi Arabia. But Mr Sunak is said to have called for a delay to assess costs of nuclear and eco power.

In total, , pupils were off for Covid-related reasons on March , up from , on March , according to the Department for Education. Teachers and unions have warned the level of absences threatens to seriously damage youngsters exam grades and that ending free and regular testing in schools was clearly a bad call. The figures also showed an estimated .% of teachers and school leaders were absent on March , up from .% on March . Some % of all state schools had more than % of their teachers and school leaders absent, up from % on March , the data shows. It comes as school leaders scramble to help kids who missed lessons because of the pandemic catch up on lost learning. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “These figures are absolutely in line with what we have been hearing from our members. Covid cases have been spiking again in many schools over the past week or so – in line with the rising numbers nationally.” Mr Whiteman said staff absences are “once again a big concern”, with the data revealing that nearly one in ten teachers and school leaders are off, “which is as bad as the very start of term”. He said many schools say it is “near impossible” to find supply teachers to provide cover, adding that “there is no doubt that this level of disruption has a negative impact on pupils”.  He said: “The Government cannot just let Covid rip through schools. Learners need and deserve better than that. Covid hasn’t gone away and we need a proper plan for how to live with it long term that is focused on keeping levels low and reducing disruption.” He said with “exams looming for many students this is a very worrying time”. He added: “Many schools are still finishing teaching the specications as there has been so much disruption over the two years of exam courses it is getting very tight for time already for teacher-led revision and exam preparation work. “More disruption now could be seriously damaging to pupils’ exam chances and education recovery.” Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “These statistics chime with what we are hearing from schools. Once again, many are seeing very severe disruption caused by Covid, with high levels of both pupil and staff absence. “The improvement in the picture we saw in the national data in early March has proved to be a  dawn, unfortunately.” He continued: “Worryingly, this latest wave of disruption comes as students are preparing for exams in GCSEs, A-levels and other important qualications. It is an extremely challenging situation. “It is very clear that the Government must, as an absolute minimum, continue to make available free Covid testing for education settings after April , and that it must extend and simply financial assistance for the cost of supply cover beyond the end of this term, when the current scheme is due to end.” Meanwhile, Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, said the Government must change course on testing. She said: The Governmentaposs plan to end regular testing in schools and free testing in the community after this month is clearly a bad call. It will make Covid outbreaks and future waves hard to track and render impossible the efforts to anticipate trends. Without cases being picked up and isolated, widespread disruption in schools due to the virus will become an ever-increasing threat as we approach exam season. We have got to see a change of course on Covid policy from the top, with testing remaining free and at school level a renewed and much more far-reaching commitment to monitoring, air filtration, and other building requirements. It is only though such preventative measures that we can reliably keep education disruption under control, at a time when cases are rising. Living with Covid must not mean ignoring it.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons.

They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked.

Ministers sanctioned Mr Usmanov earlier this month because of his “close links to the Kremlin” as they seek to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for waging war.The Government said he owns Beechwood House in Highgate, north-west London, and estimated it is worth £ million, as well as the th century Sutton Place estate in Surrey.But a spokesman, quoted by the BBC and the , said most of his UK property and his yacht had already been “long ago transferred into irrevocable trusts”.“From that point on, Mr Usmanov did not own them, nor was he able to manage them or deal with their sale, but could only use them on a rental basis. Mr Usmanov withdrew from the beneficiaries of the trusts, donating his beneficial rights to his family,” he added.  Sanctions experts questioned whether the Government would struggle to link the properties to Mr Usmanov under the more opaque and complex ownership structures. But the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We remain confident these sanctions will have a signicant impact on Usmanov. I think of that there’s no doubt.” He added: “The sanctions against Usmanov were enacted with immediate effect, he cannot access his assets, it’s illegal for any person or company in the UK to do business with him. “And crucially, when it comes to sanctions, we are wherever possible moving as one with our western allies, so those that may be seeking to move assets will find they’re not welcome in the vast majority of the western world.” He was sanctioned alongside former Russian deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov on March .At the time, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: “Sanctioning Usmanov and Shuvalov sends a clear message that we will hit oligarchs and iniduals closely associated with the Putin regime and his barbarous war.“We won’t stop here. Our aim is to cripple the Russian economy and starve Putin’s war machine.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Liz TrussVladimir PutinBBCBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Meanwhile tax and student loan repayment thresholds are being frozen in a ‘ stealth tax ’ squeeze on the cost of living.  The Mirror understands officials are braced for inflation to peak above % this Spring, with formal forecasts due to be produced tomorrow.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering cutting fuel duty by p a litre and is said to have looked at raising the National Insurance threshold, to take some of the lowest-paid Brits out of the soon-to-be-hiked tax.But heaposs resisting any bigger action like axing the NI hike entirely - or raising pensions or benefits beyond .%. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis warned on Sunday: “I am virtually out of tools to help people now.  “It’s not something money management can fix. It’s not something for those in the lowest incomes, telling them to cut their bills will work. “We need political intervention.” So as we wait for Tory Rishi Sunak to deliver any help, let’s look at the biggest cost-of-living hikes he needs to deal with - and the dates they’ll hit. InflationDATE: NOWUK CPI inflation has already hit .%, raising the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades.The war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine is now making this worse, with officials now braced for inflation to peak above % in April.It will mean the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel, and tightens business margins to the point where firms could go bust. The Resolution Foundation expects inflation to remain high for most of this year and still be above % in September - a level not seen since the early s.  Interest ratesDATE: NOW Last week the Bank of England increased interest rates to .%, despite warnings it would “crush” households already drowning in the cost of living crisis.The Bank took the move to slow the economy down and cool soaring inflation . Governor Andrew Bailey recently appealed to workers not to ask for big pay rises, as that fuels inflation further. But it will mean new mortgage rates become more expensive, and inflicts an overnight rise to monthly payments for people on standard iable rates. Petrol pricesDATE: NOWPetrol prices have hit record highs due to Russia’s war in Ukraine, leading Chancellor Rishi Sunak to hint he’ll temporarily cut fuel duty.The average price of petrol reached .p a litre while diesel rose to .p a litre Sunday before last.A month earlier they averaged .p and .p a litre respectively. A family car with a typical -litre tank is now paying £.p to fill up compared to £. a year earlier.But Labour warned even a rumoured p-a-litre cut would make a dference of only a couple of quid to a family tank.And Mr Sunak would face pressure to make any cut permanent, despite Tories having frozen the duty for  years already while raising taxes on everything .Energy billsDATE: April The energy price cap will increase to a record £,-a-year for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. A second hike that could be just as big or even worse is expected on October . Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. Tory MPs say he must go further - for instance by increasing the £ discount or £ loan, or delaying repayments. But he was reluctant to announce help before April .  National Insurance riseDATE: April A £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.Employees will pay .p more in the pound on earnings above £, a year, a rise from % to .%. This earnings threshold has risen since last year, but only by .% - less than inflation. The Lib Dems brand this a stealth tax that makes Brits pay £ more.Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more.But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. While Rishi Sunak is unlikely to scrap the rise completely, there are claims he could change the earnings threshold - for instance, aligning it with income tax . Income tax ‘stealth tax’DATE: April Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll have to carry on paying % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £, - just like this year. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . And that was analysed before the latest rises in inflation. The IFS think tank now warns it’s a £.bn ‘stealth tax’, two and a half times bigger than first thought.  Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachersDATE: April Inflation means many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by rising prices. At this rate workers will need a rise of % to % just to keep up with rising prices, but the government is resisting these. Ministers have already spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. The Royal College of Nursing is demanding % above inflation.  Council tax riseDATE: April  Most of England’s families will be hit with a Council Tax rise of % or more next Friday, Mirror research reveals. Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Now of course, most people’s council tax will be lower than last year due to the £ discount for Band A-D homes in England. But there are two big catches. First, that £ is meant to pay for energy bills - not absorbing the cost of a tax rise. In Rutland a Band D bill will go up by £, wiping out much of the £ discount. Second, the £ is a one-off. Next Spring, you’ll suddenly feel the force of not just this year’s rise but also the April  rise at the same time.Search for your council tax rise by postcode by following the link below. Covid testsDATE: April From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.Boots is preparing to charge £ for a pack of five. Student loans aposstealth taxaposDATE: April Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  Real terms cut to welfare benefitsDATE: April  Benefits will rise by .%, as little as £. a month on the rate of Universal Credit.Tory MPs pushed through the plans earlier this year - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last September, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most, with food bank use climbing. The Resolution Foundation has urged Rishi Sunak to raise benefits more generously as an urgent priority, ahead of any decision to cancel the National Insurance rise. Pensions are being cut in real terms - before rising next yearDATE: April Pensions could rise by more than % next April after the Tory DWP chief promised to bring back the triple lock - despite soaring inflation. Therese Coffey suspended the triple lock - a solemn manesto pledge - for one year in   because post-Covid wages were bouncing back in an “anomaly”.That sparked fury as it meant the state pension will rise by only .% next month, less than inflation. That is a real-terms cut of £ to Britain’s million pensioners, Shadow DWP chief Jon Ashworth said.But Ms Coffey said the triple lock wouldin   as promised. That could lead to a rise of .%, experts predict. A real-terms cut to childcare helpDATE: NOWPoor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Spring StatementPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And Adrian RB Johnson, an investment banker, paid for £, worth of booze and food for the dinners. Theresa May agreed to the temporary Northern Ireland Protocol, which effectively places a trade border in the Irish Sea, in the hope that a solution could be found to keep the UK as a single customs territory without endangering peace in Northern Ireland.Mr Jenkin told the Mirror: I am pleased to say that there are now many more MPs from across the Party who are much better informed about the Northern Ireland Protocol.We are working together to find a solution to restore the Good Friday Agreement, while also respecting the EU internal market, and underpinning the Union of the United Kingdom.”In January, two days before the first event, Sir Bernard wrote on Twitter that the Northern Ireland Protocol could not be permanent - and was not protecting the peace process, but destroying it.And he has called for the protocol to be replaced with a system of mutual enforcement at the border, where the UK would guarantee there wouldnapost be a flood of non-compliant goods crossing into the Republic of Ireland from the UK.But it remains unclear how this would be enforced without additional border infrastructure.Sir Bernard mentioned he was organising the dinners during a meeting of the Commons Standards committee on February .But he told the committee the dinners were to discuss Britainaposs continuous at-sea deterrent. He said: There are entries going on the register. I am organising dinners about the continuous at-sea deterrent, and they are being funded by a Conservative donor.It is on the register. Even though I am just a pass-through, it is my dinner party where people are coming along and discussing the continuous at-sea deterrent, so it is on the register.

At the moment, itll be a real-terms cut for millions of BritsThe DWP has been inundated with claims for Universal Credit due to the impact of the pandemic Image:UnknownByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar |comments Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces mounting calls to ease the cost-of-living crisis for millions of Brits when he delivers his Spring Statement mini-Budget on Wednesday. Benefits and pensions are due to rise on April  but only by .% - far less than inflation which itaposs currently feared could top %. That works out to be as little as £. a month extra on Universal Credit - a real-terms cut. It also comes just months after the Chancellor slashed Universal Credit by £ a week off the standard allowance, when he ended an -month uplt that was brought in for Covid.This anomaly is because benefit rises every April are based on inflation, but only on what inflation was the previous September.Because inflation has risen so fast since then, benefits have already been left behind.  Due to the time lag, itaposs likely there will be a big increase in benefits in April . On current predictions, it could be over % - which is the predicted inflation this coming September. But this will come far too late for families who are facing a cost-of-living crisis now. Charities and experts have called on Mr Sunak to shorten the time interval between the inflation measure and each benefits rise, or to bring forward next yearaposs rise. This would help stop the rollercoaster of below-inflation rises one year and above-inflation rises the next, the Resolution Foundation says. The DWP would argue itaposs already offered more help to people on Universal Credit.In a Budget rabbit out of the hat in October, Mr Sunak handed more generous benefits to .million working families by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate from p to p.But this only helps those who work, not the sick or out-of-work. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves called for benefits to rise by the rate of inflation - which is .% now and could rise beyond %.She told the Observer: “The chancellor should look at how to uprate benefits in a fair way. They are supposed to go up by inflation and they are not at the moment. The Resolution Foundation says raising benefits would be the best way to help the poorest who face a cost of living crisis next month. An analysis by the Foundation compares the impact of three potential policies, all of which cost around £billion. They are lting all working age and pensioner benefits by .% rather than .% as planned offsetting the looming National Insurance Contributions hike for lower earners by raising the threshold at which they start being paid to £, and axing the .% rise altogether. The think-tank says raising benefits “delivers the biggest cash gains of the three policy options across the bottom half of the income distribution”, by a wide margin. That is despite many Tory MPs campaigning to halt the National Insurance hike, and very few by comparison campaigning to make benefits higher. The precious few who do argue for higher benefits say the current rate of Universal Credit is simply not high enough for a just society and leaves people turning to food banks. Yet Mr Sunak seems unlikely to raise benefits by more than .% because of the multi-billion pound cost - and the moral need to raise pensions and pay at the same timehe does. He might unveil new help in tomorrowaposs Spring Statement for rising energy bills but it seems unlikely to improve on the .% rise in benefits. So in summary - benefits are technically rising on  April , but due to soaring inflation, itaposs in fact a real-terms cut. The full rates are below.

Some public-facing jobs tend to receive more scrutiny than others - such as police officers and parking attendants - but there is one role in particular that almost everyone has an opinionabout. GP receptionists have a dficult job. While those of us trying to make an appointment can feel frustratedwe arenapost given what we want or need, the person on the end of the phone probably has to deal with a lot of hassle. One woman who works in a GP surgery has aired her frustrations with the way sheaposs perceived by the public in a post on Mumsnet. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here The anonymous woman said she created the account specically to respond to the rude and misinformed comments sheaposs read on the site about GP receptionists. She writes: I have done this job for  years, it’s hard work but can be at times extremely rewarding. I work with a great team. But she adds that, contrary to popular belief, her job is about much more than just answering phones.  She writes: I deal with chemists, pharmacists, hospital secretaries, emails, post, hundreds of clinical letters and test reports, arrange all referrals, do all test requests, type all clinicians letters, new patient files are refilled, files from patients leaving must be found and ed, clinical letters received are scanned, coded and actioned, translators requests, letters to be typed up and patients to be called to arrange reviews, Imms, smears etc, the loaning out of medical equipment - there’s lots more but hopefully you are getting the idea that my job involves far more than answering the odd call. [sic] After reeling off the long list of responsibilities sheaposs tasked with, the receptionist makes the point that what patients see is just a snippet of what she does day to day. She also tackled the complaint that people often call for an appointment and are told thereaposs nothing available - but after a quick conversation they discover there actually is availability to see a doctor or nurse. She explains This is because I can put it down as an urgent call. If it is NOT an urgent call I will be reprimanded by my manager andthis continues I would possibly lose my job. The woman then opens up the conversation to readers, offering to answer their queries and complaints to help them understand her job isnapost always as it seems.

Driver Jack Richardson, , had smashed into the crowd in a targeted attack after shooting a love rival with a BB gun.  The shocking crash happened as revellers gathered to watch Englandaposs Euros clash with Scotland on TV at the Gigmill pub on June  last year. Richardson fled the scene but handed himself in two days later and admitted a string of violent offences. Aaliyah was left bed bound but despite her injuries she gave birth to a baby boy just five weeks after the horror crash. Last week she bravely attended Wolverhampton Crown Court on crutches and watched as Richardson was jailed for five years and three months. Speaking after the case, Aaliyah, of Stourbridge, said: “We’d gone to the pub to celebrate another of my friends who was pregnant.“We settled down, there was kids everywhere. At the time England were playing Scotland on TV so it was busy but everyone was having a great time. “Suddenly I saw Jack who I know through friends of friends. He pulled out a gun, the sound of this gun sounded like an actual gun but it was a BB gun. “He shot a man I know around three times in the leg. Everyone, including the kids at the pub, were running around screaming. “Jack left the pub and I went outside to go home but then this car reversed at high speed towards me.  “I tried to run up the stairs to get safe but I was too late the car hit me and just went over the top of me. “At first I didn’t feel any pain. I must have been going in and out of consciousness. “When I came to, all I could see were the car tyres above me still spinning. All I could remember was saying to myself ‘I am going to die and ‘what about my baby’. “I had no other option to wriggle myself further under the car to get free. “Both of my legs were totally numb and my foot was hanging off. I had to use my fingernails to drag myself from underneath the car.  “The car could have come down on me at any moment and I was screaming and shouting. “When I was finally out from under the car I just lay on the ground feeling my stomach but I couldn’t feel my baby moving. “I thought I had lost my baby and had lost my foot. I was drting in out of consciousness. I was just screaming ‘my baby, my baby, it is not moving, somebody please help me.’ “Then there were armed police all around me. My foot was in pieces, I had a seven-inch gap on my foot and it was hanging off.”  Aaliyah was rushed to Russell Hall Hospital in Dudley and underwent emergency surgery to save her baby. Luckily, the impact of the crash did not do lasting damage and five weeks later she gave birth to lbs oz Shay Bustin. Aaliyah, who also has a five-year-old daughter Sienna Mai, added: “I was put in the emergency trauma unit while my foot was being strapped up. “I had snapped every single nerve and tendon in my foot. It will never get back to normal. The main tendon that connects your toe to your knee cap was snapped in half.  “The baby at this point was stable. After the surgery on my foot, I was bed bound for six weeks and had to have carers four times a day.” Shay, who is now eight months old, now has a tilted neck and breathing problems as a result of the trauma suffered by his mum following the crash. Aaliyah added: “Because I was bed bound, and in so much pain, the baby had stopped growing and I could not have him naturally because my foot was still in a cast. I had to have a caesarean. “Where he was positioned in my womb, his one muscle on his neck is shorter than the other. His neck and head are tilted to the left.  “He is undergoing physiotherapy to try and straighten up his neck and still has dficulties breathing. “There are a lot of ongoing problems. He is constantly poorly. He may have to be transferred to Birmingham’s Children Hospital to help straighten his neck. “As for my foot, I still have to use crutches and there is not much movement in my foot. My tendons are still tight.” Richardson, of Stourbridge, flew into a jealous rage after seeing his ex-partner’s new boyfriend in the pub.  He admitted two counts of grievous bodily harm, two counts of actual bodily harm, possession of an imitation firearm with intent, possession of cannabis, driving without insurance. Aaliyah added: “Whether he was sentenced to  years, nothing is going to make me feel any better. The damage is done. I am going to have to live with that damage for the rest of my le. “I hate Jack for what he has done. My son suffered for the first few weeks of his le all because of one man and his actions. “I have been left with total damage in my foot, you could stab a kne through my foot and I would not feel it. “I am glad he is behind bars.

The dogs had been kept in dark sheds and had had very little human contact.Inspector Justin Stubbs, who led the rescue operation, said: “These were well loved dogs but the number had just become too much for the owner. We worked closely with them and they agreed it would be better for the dogs to come into our care where new homes could be found for them.”to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The dogs had matted fur, fleas and were not used to being handled, and staff at RSPCA Block Fen Animal Centre, in Cambridgeshire, set about cleaning them up, treating them for ailments, and slowly getting them used to the outside world.Kennel supervisor Tfany Saunders said: “When Ralph arrived he was completely shutdown. He would squash himself at the back of his kennel and spent all of his time staring at the wall. He was very matted and covered in faeces and urine. “The team spent weeks just quietly sitting in his kennel with him offering him treats. Eventually, he’d come up behind us and take the treats from our hand before running away to the safety of his corner and eating them. He wouldn’t eat his dinner until night when we’d all gone home it was heartbreaking.” Staff continued and kept his routine strict so he’d only spend time with a few people who he slowly built strong bonds with.  “When he first wagged his tail as we entered the kennel it was so incredible!” Tfany added. Dedicated staff spent months gaining the dogs’ confidence and socialising them. Most of them needed their coats shaving off due to matts and many were suffering from flea infestations and ear infections. Tfany added: “The dogs had experienced little of the outside world and were all terried. They wouldn’t look at us and many would freezewe entered their kennel. Amazingly, like Ralph, one-by-one they each started to come out of their shell and really have flourished since.” The team slowly started to introduce Ralph to a harness and lead as he’d never even worn a collar before. Gradually they helped him learn how to meet new people and how to go out on walks, but the behaviour team knew they’d need to find very special owners who could continue his training in his new home. Sarah and Trevor Rix, from Norfolk, adopted Ralph in June , after he’d spent more than eight months working with the RSPCA’s dedicated behaviour and care teams.  Sarah said: “Ralph was a very timid, scared little boy when we rehomed him but with help of the RSPCA staff we became attuned to his needs and learned when to give him his space and when to encourage him to expand the boundaries of his comfort zone. With a calm and safe routine his behaviour gradually improved as his trust in us increased. “Ralph loves our other dog, Rosie, and she has helped him with some initial issues with toilet training and car travel. Ralph and Rosie love to go for woodland walks and we recently took the brave step of letting Ralph off the lead to run and play when we’re in safe areas he absolutely loves this. “Ralph has made lots of new friendsand has gradually overcome any uncertainty. Our regular acquaintances say they canapost believe how he has changed from a nervous seven-year-old puppy into such a happy, confident dog. “Ralph is a lovely little chap who melts the hearts of everyone he meets and is a favourite with all our family especially the grandchildren. He is a very sensitive and gentle character who may never fully escape his history but, every day, he brings love into our home. We feel the day we met him was the start of a wonderful relationship for all of us.” Tfany added: “It’s so wonderful to see how well Ralph is now doing in his new home, he’s unrecognisable from the frightened little dog who arrived with his friends almost  months ago during lockdown. This is what we do this job for, so dogs like Ralph can have the second chance that they deserve.”To help the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming animals in desperate need of care, like Ralph, please visit www.rspca.org.uk give to donate, or call our donation line on   .Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

Adrienne Eiser Treeby, from Bermondsey, South London, is one of just a handful of women in the UK working as a charcutier specialising in pork. As a former professional chef, she decided to change jobs after meeting charcutier, Kris Doll, during a working stint in the US years ago. The -year-old fell in love with the art of curing and cutting meat so much that she trained in it for three years, all while working full-time to pay her bills.Adrienne, who is originally from Canada, said: My mother calls me a apospork whispererapos. I think at last count there are three of us running businesses like these – one woman in Ireland, one up north and myself in London. Meat is seen as an extremely masculine activity, which can make it a bit irksome when youaposre a woman. Someone once asked meaposa woman could actually do this workapos – to which I laughed and said aposwell, Iaposve been doing it for eight years, soI have any problems, I guess Iaposll let you knowapos.  Adrienne spoke about how she cleans out dead pigsapos ears and intestines. She said: Many years ago I had the opportunity to make sausage castings from start to finish, to which I helped clean the intestines straight from the pig, which involved a lot of flushing out the original contents. You can imagine what a pig might keep in there. Itaposs not for the faint of heart, I can assure you.Despite all that, I actually adore the smell of the meat aging. A bit cheesy, a bit tart, really tasty. I used to sayI could bottle it as a perfume and wear it, I definitely would!” Adrienne even names some of the pigs – as well as enjoying chats with them. She said: I helped feed and raise some urban pigs years ago that we named and [we] spoke to them plenty. Adrienne has revealed her top tips on how to make your own bacon. INGREDIENTSLoin, belly, jowl or collar of free range high-welfare sustainably-reared pork % of bacon curing salt per kg OR : demerara sugar to sea salt for a natural cure.METHODSkin the loin using a boning kne or ask your butcher to do it for you, and always work with the kne away from your body, as it is easy to slip. If using belly, sheet bone the ribs, keeping as close as you can to the bone, the bones can then be used for BBQ ribs. Trim off any loose bits of pork and straighten up the edges. On a tray, rub the cure thoroughly in to the meat, concentrating most on the flesh side, experiment with dferent sugars, spices and chilli flakes, depending on your taste. Ensure that all cracks and crevices are well covered. Place in a vacuum bag or Ziplock bag and refrigerate, moisture will leach out effectively becoming a brine, this is fine – just try to turn daily. The classic time calculation is one day per half inch thick piece of meat, plus two days, so a two-inch thick loin would be in cure for six days. Remove from the vacuum bag over the sink and rinse well under cold running water. Pat dry with a clean tea towel. Allow to dry in the fridge for two to three days, uncovered, it’s idealyou can hang the bacon so that air can circulate all around,not, place on a plate or tray and turn a couple of times each day. Once ready, slice using the longest, sharpest kne that you have, once your bacon ‘flitch’ gets too thin to slice, cut into lardons. Cook and enjoy.  Just because there is an end goal in mind, it doesnapost mean you aren’t treating the animal with love and care the whole way through. People are often surprised by the fact that Adrienne doesnapost eat much meat herself. She said: My daughter could eat her weight in our Pigtails – the name we give our snacking sausages – but outside of that, people are often surprised at how little meat I eat and feed my family.  I do genuinely believe that the way we eat meat needs to change and I wonapost eat pork, beef or lamb that I canapost be certain was raised in the high-welfare, the regenerative way that Iaposve come to believe is the only way forwards. Most of my family are actually in food as well – so itaposs less surprising dinner table conversation than you might think. The thing I find tickles me the most though and possibly doesnapost tickle my family, is that I specialise in pork and weaposre Jewish... so yeah, I suppose Iaposm the black pig of the family! Adrienneaposs job is very physical and required her having to lug huge weights of up to kg. Adrienne said: Charcuterie is genuinely a magical process but itaposs actually more about curing than butchering.  From carrying half a pig on my shoulder or hefting up kg of minced meat to dump it into our mixer, itaposs definitely a workout. But that said, I was still working right up till I went into labour with my daughter, so Iaposd argue anyone can figure out a way to do it! And like most jobs, itaposs only hardyou arenapost enthusiastic about what youaposre doing.  In , Adrienne launched her own company, Crown  Queue Meats, making British cured meats from traditional and historical British recipes. However, being a meat curer isnapost easy in , with veganism growing in popularity. Adrienne says she doesnapost want people to consume more meat but rather change the way they eat to reduce waste. She said: I honestly do believe that the way we eat meat needs to change, including reducing how much we consume and what farming practices we are willing to accept. That’s one of the reasons why I am so particular about which farms we work with, the business is low-to-zero-waste and why we’re so transparent about the process. My best friend growing up was a vegetarian and she was actually one of the most supportive [when I launched my business]. Understanding what you eat, and respecting it, should be everyoneaposs goals, whatever they choose to eat.

Sarah Dinesapos first baby, Montague, is now  months old and weighs in lbs oz. This makes him the average size of three-month-old baby as a newborn. aposMontyapos went straight into toddler clothes and now wears items for two to three-year-olds. Sarah, a teacher, initially wanted a water birth in her home in Broadstone, Dorset, without pain relief, but eventually had to have a c-section, partly due to the size of her baby. The astonished -year-old said: He was so big when he was born, he looked ridiculous.When the doctoraposs took him out, they were all laughing and I didnapost know why at first. One of them said he was ready for school, and the little towel they wrapped him just didnapost fit. He was in the .th centile for height and .th for weight. None of the clothes Sarah brought in for Monty fit when he was first born.She said: Even the little cap they gave him at the hospital was too small. My sister had to run and buy me some nappies because none of the ones we had fit him either. As heaposs got older heaposs gone up and up in sizes, heaposs always been in bigger clothes than his age. Heaposs a week off being one and heaposs in stuff for a - year old. None of Sarahaposs doctors can account for why Monty was born so big. Sarah said: After he was born we were both tested for gestational diabetes loads of times, but it was never positive.Iaposm  foot , and my husband Elliott, , is six foot, so we were never going to have a small baby. Neither of us were particularly big when we born, I think I just carry big babies. Sarah felt she had a large bump, but docs all predicted Monty would weigh around lbs. She said: All the scans were normal, so I was all set to go to have a home birth.  Initially, I just wanted to have a water-birth and that was going to be my own form of pain relief. Monty was  days late, so it got to the point where the doctor was talking about a planned c-section or inducing me. Sarah ended up needing to go to the hospital for an emergency c-section. She said: My water broke in the morning, and I was in full labour that evening, but I hadnapost dialated at all. The pain got so bad that I asked for gas and air, and then eventually we had to go into hospital. I didnapost want to be induced, and we had spoke about a planned c-section because he was so late, we even did all the paperwork. That ended up being useful because we had to go in for the emergency c-section, weaposd filled in all the forms.

Jordan, who is hoping to go to university in September to train to be a paramedic, ran over to help when she heard screaming. She said: I gave CPR to the baby. My head is a mess. I heard them screaming for help and I ran over. The parents were hysterical. Iaposve lived here for eight years but Iaposve never spoken to them before.Have you been impacted by this incident  Email webnews@mirrorPolice were called at around .pm following reports that a child had been attacked by a dog at an address in Blackbrook, St Helens. Emergency services attended and Bella-Rae was taken to hospital where she sadly died as a result of her injuries. The dog was handed over to the police at the address and has been humanely destroyed. Shocked residents of Bidston Avenue in the town spoke of their utter devastation after the horric incident.Locals in the “quiet” road fought back tears as they fondly remembered watching the tot playing with her brother. Neighbour Joanne Matthews, , said: She was such a beautul little girl, toddling about. Iaposd see the family in passing, just to say hello, and they were always very pleasant. One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: “They were a lovely family, and it’s just devastating what has happened. “The dog had a stocky build, it was a Staffordshire terrier or Pitbull, and it was fully grown. There was only one.  “It’s devastating. This is a normal quiet street, and the children would play in the street. The little girl, a toddler, was always about. It’s a shame I won’t be able to see that again. Mourners gathered to lay flowers at the house, which was taped off this morning as police officers stood guard. Neighbours said that the family of four had lived at the house for around three years but had only recently purchased the dog. Another neighbour, who only wanted to provide his first name, David, said: There were absolutely loads of police officers, there must have been about  police cars and ambulances.  The square was absolutely swarming with them, Iaposve never seen so many police in my le. I was just in shock when I heard a baby had been attacked by a dog. I believe the dog was tranquilised in the house with a dart gun. Other neighbours reported seeing the animal brought out with a metal collar and rod by police officers. Speaking this morning, Superintendant Steve Brizell said: We were called by the family of a  month old girl Bella-Rae Birch, Bella Rae has lost her le in the most unimaginably terrible circumstances and our thoughts are first and foremost with the family and the wider community at this time.  Our specialist family liaison officers are providing the family of Bella-Rae with support and officers will remain in the area in the coming days to provide further support and reassurance for the wider community. Detective Inspector Lisa Milligan said yesterday: This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the child’s family at this devastating time. The little girl’s parents and wider family are absolutely devastated and our specialist Family Liaison Officers are providing them with support at this horrendous time. Whilst we are in the very early stages of the investigation into this extremely tragic incident we can confirm that the dog was only bought by the family a week ago and officers are working to identy the previous owners of the dog concerned and establish its history. Our officers will remain on Bidston Avenue this evening and in the coming days to provide reassurance to the local community and we will work tirelessly to establish the full circumstances. “If you were in the Bidston Avenue area this afternoon and witnessed anything, or have any information about the dog in question then please come forward speak to one of our officers. Our officers take the issue of dangerous dogs very seriously. Over the past years we have worked proactively with the five local authorities in Merseyside to ensure prohibited dogs are taken off the streets.“ The dog will be subject to further forensic examinations to determine the breed of dog and whether it is or isn’t a legal breed, the police have said. Officers remain at the scene this evening to examine CCTV, speak to witnesses and go door-to-door.Anyone with any information is asked to contact us via the social media desk @MerPolCC or aposMerseyside Police Contact Centreapos on Facebook, with reference .

The Queen welcomed the Ambassador of Qatar and the Ambassador of Poland via video link today. The diplomats, who were at Buckingham Palace, presented the letters of recall of their predecessors and their own credentials at the audiences on Tuesday.Speaking on GB News yesterday morning, the actor, who has long been friends with many members of the Royal Family, said: “I have heard that the reason she’s not doing a lot of the events that she should be doing and cancelling them is because she is in a wheelchair. “She doesn’t want to be seen, she’s very proud. She’s our greatest ever monarch. It’s so very sad and I hope she is able to make her anniversary celebrations.” His comments were made while speaking with Eamonn Holmes and Isabel Webster. Asked by Eamonn about comparisons with the Queen’s late sister Margaret, whose appearance in a wheelchair at the Queen Motheraposs st birthday shocked the public, he claimed it was “embarrassing” for her.  Royal aides are reportedly anxious for the Queen not to replicate her sister Princess Margaret who was seen in public in a wheelchair, six months before passed away.A palace source said: Itaposs a haunting image and not one the Queen remembers fondly, William Tallon, the Queen Motheraposs page, then pushed Margaret in front of the waiting media in a wheelchair. Margaret was known for glamorous good looks that had lasted well into middle age. The world had never seen her like this. A source who remembers the occasion told the Daily Mail: The optics were terrible. It was supposed to be about the Queen Mother but all anyone saw was a sadly declining Princess Margaret. Last week, the head of state missed the Commonwealth Day service at the Abbey, a decision understood to be related to her comfort rather than a specic illness. But she has continued with light duties including some face-to-face audiences. Today, the Queen was onscreen and seen smiling and wearing a regal purple day dress. She welcomed the Ambassador of Qatar Fahad bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, who was joined by Sheikha Raya Khala Abdulla Khala Al Khala. The monarch also received Polish diplomat Professor Piotr Wilczek. In just a weekaposs time, the Queen is hoping to attend the Duke of Edinburghaposs memorial service at Westminster Abbey. Large numbers of the royal family are set to gather next Tuesday, alongside Philipaposs friends, colleagues, representatives of organisations he supported and foreign royals to pay tribute to the -year-old duke who died in April last year.

Jurors at the trial were shown the footage, after the suspect allegedly told the veteran MPaposs aide: I donapost think Iaposll take too long. Ali Harbi Ali, , making the near-two-and-a-half hour trek from his home in north London. He travelled along busy high streets and residential areas to Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on October  last year. Ali, wearing a long, khaki coat and with a black, backpack slung over his right shoulder, could be seen appearing to assist a fellow passenger with directions as he waited for his connection at Barking railway station, according to the footage.  The Old Bailey heard he then spent about  minutes lying in wait, yards from the church building where he was due to meet Sir David, having duped his staff into believing he was a healthcare worker moving to the area and wanted to discuss local matters. Jurors previously heard that Ali had spent years hatching his plot, prosecutors said, researching a number of potential high-profile political targets including Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Sir Keir Starmer, before settling on -year-old Tory backbencher, Sir David.  He allegedly stabbed Sir David  times with a carving kne with a -inch blade as he sent a WhatsApp message apologising to his family and friends, attempting to justy his actions. Ali then spoke to his worried sister on the phone for  minutes, as Sir David lay bleeding to death, before being apprehended by two unarmed plain-clothes police officers, who pinned him to the floor and arrested him, the court heard. Sir David, a married father-of-five, was pronounced dead at the scene.  On Tuesday, prosecutor Tom Little QC took the jury through a timeline of events leading up to the Sir Davidaposs death, including email exchanges between Ali and the politicianaposs aide Rebecca Hayton. On September , Ali allegedly emailed Sir Davidaposs office to ask about a meeting. He wrote: I will be moving to the area from a Labour-held constituency and wanted to get to know my future MP.  Since I work in healthcare, I would like to know his plans,any, for the hospital and workers. Also, as someone interested in Christianity, I have seen many churches in my area losing attendances and struggle with upkeep, eventually becoming at risk of being demolished or repurposed. I wanted to knowthe situation in Southend is similar and,so, what are the solutions.He added: Looking forward to seeing you soon. If all appointments are taken, let me knowthereaposs a cancellation. Iaposll be in the local area and will be able to drop by. Ms Hayton responded by requesting Aliaposs address and full name to check he was a constituent, jurors heard. Ali gave a postcode in Southend and told her: Iaposll be in the local area on Friday so it would be nice to see him regardless, although I know heaposs a very busy man so I can appreciate thataposs not possible.  Ms Hayton told Ali she would be happy to book him in for October . He later confirmed he was able to clear up my schedule and asked for an appointment at noon. He told Ms Hayton: I donapost really know how long the appointments are but I donapost think Iaposll take too long. Thanks for all the help so far.  The court heard that around the time of the attack on Sir David, Ali sent a message to family and friends which appeared to have been drafted days before, the court was told. In it, he said the attack was for the sake of Allah, jurors heard. He allegedly wrote: I apologise to my family for deceiving them for so long. I would have preferred Hijrah so as not to harm you but I could not. The obligations upon me to take revenge for the blood of Muslims were too great. The shame of abiding in the very lands that carry out these horrendous acts against my brothers and sisters was too much. Ali, from Kentish Town, north London, has denied preparing terrorist acts and murder.

Zara Barton, , said her skin started to become itchy last February but dismissed it as a stress rash from an aposupsetting break-upapos or from boozing too much and was prescribed creams and antihistamines by doctors. She put her persistent cough weight loss and a hard cm lump that appeared above her collarbone down to leading a apostypical student lestyleapos. However, after the hives on her body became aposunbearableapos the fashion marketing and branding student pressed for answers and was shocked to eventually be diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin Lymphoma last November. The student had her eggs collected to help preserve her fertility before she started chemotherapy in December, and now, halfway through her treatment, she received the good news last month that there were no signs of active cancer in her body. The -year old is passionate about raising awareness of the symptoms of Hodgkin Lymphoma and urges anyone who recognises the symptoms to visit a doctor - and to keep ingtheyaposre not taken seriously. Zara, of Solihull, West Midlands, said: I thinkpeople recognise the symptoms, donapost hesitate to go to the doctors, evenyou feel like it is nothing because I just assumed aposit was nothing to worry about.  Something like itching, I didnapost have a clue that that was a sign of blood cancer. Itaposs best to double-check and you can tell when somethingaposs not right, even at the very start when I was getting the itching I just thought aposthis isnapost me, this doesnapost feel right. So itaposs important to be persistentyou still feel like something is wrong. Iaposve had so many comments on my TikTok about people with similar experiences of going to the doctors and not really being listened to and I guess thataposs because weaposre young and they just think apostheyaposre fit and healthyapos. The -year old said that her itching started last February and she visited the doctor in May where she was prescribed medication, which she hoped would solve the issue. However, it got progressively worse to the point where sheaposd scratch her skin so much it would bruise. In addition, she experienced weight loss and lost around a stone - but thought it was due to eating less. Zara said: Iaposd itch, which would then come up in hives almost anywhere on my body - so my arms, legs, feet, anywhere really.  It would literally drive me mad. It would be hot and was really getting unbearable. It was really persistent and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I had creams that I would put on but I remember sometimes Iaposd lie there with cold flannels and a fan just to try and make it more bearable. I put the itching down to multiple things. I did go through a pretty upsetting breakup in Mayand during that time had a bad stress rash, so I thought maybe that had continued. I thought being at university with constant late nights, drinking regularly, probably not eating as well as I should - these were just lestyle things that made me think at the time aposokI was eating more healthily, getting more sleep, not going out as much then maybe this wouldnapost be happeningapos. The -year old had a aposreally reactive swollen glandapos on one side of her neck which would disappear and reappear again for months. But she thought this wasnapost a cause for concern, given sheaposd previously had swollen glands from having tonsillitis and was at university where she assumed sheaposd pick up colds and illnesses. Zara said: When I first noticed it [the lump], I wasnapost alarmed at all. It was during freshers so I thought maybe it was a bit of freshers flu and could just be a swollen gland. I also noticed I had a cough which never really went away. I thought it was freshers flu. My friends all had coughs at around the same time, it was nothing really dferent compared to the people around me.I put a lot of my symptoms down to student le, especially with not being at home. My mum and I were sayingI was at home maybe we would have picked it up sooner but because youaposre so on the go you kind of just brush these things off. It was a bit dficult to get seen by the doctors as well as they were mainly telephone consultations. Theyaposre symptoms that you can so easily put down to something  and I guess I thought they were all separate issues. Zara said that at the start of October she found another lump above her collar bone and ed to the doctors, who she claims wasnapost concerned. However, at the end of the month, she saw another doctor who ran several blood tests and referred her for an urgent ultrasound scan. On November th, the evening of her scan, Zara received her diagnosis. Zara said: The doctor obviously didnapost want to have to tell me this over the phone but Iaposd been so persistent on finding out I couldnapost wait until the next day. He was like aposhave you heard of Lymphoma apos and I was like aposno, what is it apos He was like aposoh, itaposs blood cancerapos. Obviously that was just a huge shock. I just didnapost know what to expect, what that meant and what I was about to go through.He was trying to explain the treatments I might have. Obviously we didnapost know everything about it yet and we still had to find out what type and stage. You think the worst I suppose. My scan results came back showing it was stage three. It came back and showed that it was all in my neck, chest and in my spleen. That was quite scary as well finding out that it had got to that point without me knowing because I felt so normal in myself otherwise. After she was told that there was a risk of becoming infertile after chemotherapy, the student had an operation to remove and freeze her eggs in December. Ten days later Zara started chemotherapy at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since had seven rounds with five more to go. She said that her itching stopped after her first session and has decided to take a year out of her studies, and will redo the year come September. Since her diagnosis, the teen who shares informative videos about the uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, said that the support sheaposd received from family, friends and even strangers has been amazing. Zara said: My diagnosis has affected my le a lot. I was living at university with my friends and literally felt the happiest Iaposd ever been, so I felt like Iaposd gone from my highest point to my lowest really. I posted my story online because when I was diagnosed I was going to tell my close friends and I thought people were going to hear about it anyway and when people hear that someoneaposs got cancer, you donapost want them to think the worst. I wanted people to know that this is a treatable type of cancer and I just thought that it wasnapost something that I wanted to hide, or be embarrassed about, itaposs just something thataposs happened. So I just wanted to share my journey and be open about it. I didnapost realise that Lymphoma is the most common cancer in teenagers and young adults and considering Iaposve never heard about the symptoms, I wanted to raise a bit of awareness in the process. I just wanted to show that you are still you as well when you are going through your treatment, youaposre not defined by a diagnosis. I didnapost want anyone to feel sorry for me, I wanted people to see that Iaposm still me. My diagnosis has put things in perspective - leaposs too short, just do what makes you happy I suppose.

Aleksandra Aukett, , was traumatised and suffered multiple soft tissue injuries when punched, pinched and kicked by the big for his age reception class child in  while trying to keep order. Ms Aukett, who stepped up to the witness box at Central London County Court using crutches, says she has been left with le-changing chronic pain and has not ed to work due to a fear of going back to the school environment in the aftermath of her ordeal. This week, she sued the London Borough of Hillingdon, the local authority responsible for overseeing the school, claiming more should have been done to protect her in the workplace. Today, on the second day of a planned three-day trial, the council agreed to settle the case, handing Ms Aukett £, compensation, as well as paying her lawyersapos bills. Earlier, her barrister, Gemma Witherington, told Judge Richard Roberts: Ms Aukett was acting in the course of her employment when she was attacked by a child known as X.  He had attacked another child and she removed the other children from the room to safety when X launched himself at her in the corridor and punched her in the chest and pinched her. He then kicked her in the hip and groin and legs. Ms Aukett told the court she still has a lump and swelling around her hip from the attack and has yet toto work. The boy - described as big for his age - caused soft tissue injuries to her lower back, chest and left buttock as well as long-term inflammation. Medical experts for Ms Aukett said she was resilient and cheerful before the classroom assault, but is now plagued by chronic back pain, PTSD and depression. Iaposm still restricted, she said from the witness box. Iaposm nowhere near the level of mobility, fitness and health I was at before the accident.  Her barrister said the child who went for Ms Aukett had learning dficulties and a vulnerable background and said her client fully accepted this. But this was a very nasty assault which had physical and mental health consequences for her, she added. None of her colleagues had warned her about the ladaposs violent tendencies, claimed Ms Witherington. The unruly youngster had a record for physically assaulting other pupils and staff, said the barrister, adding: it was reasonably foreseeable that this child would seriously injure either another pupil or one of the teachers. If Ms Aukett had known about Xaposs condition behaviour and or had relevant training, then it was more likely than not that she could have taken steps to avoid the attack, she told the court. In particular she would have been far more cautious going out into the corridor to calm the youngster and would have ensured there was more support. Lawyers for the London Borough of Hillingdon claimed Ms Aukett had been trained in how to restrain pupils and de-escalate incidents. And council barrister Roderick Abbott said it did everything in its power to safeguard staff and pupils from any risk posed. He highlighted a specic pupil risk assessment carried out on the five-year-old which pinpointed a risk of potential hazards, including throwing items and risk of injury to staff or other pupils. This clearly identies the risk of X being violent towards staff and pupils, he argued. Ms Witherington denied the claims that everybody knew about it at the school. But Mr Abbott told the judge that given the schoolaposs general awareness of the boyaposs stormy history it would have been impossible for Ms Aukett to be unaware of Xaposs behaviour. He accepted that Ms Aukett was the victim of a violent attack while doing a dficult job but denied that the school failed in its duty to safeguard her. However, after a day of evidence before the judge and negotiations outside court, the council today agreed to settle the case by paying Ms Aukett over £, compensation, as well as her lawyersapos bills. Judge Roberts commented: The parties are to be commended. Well, Ms Aukett, bringing a law claim is very dficult and proving cases is very dficult, but youaposve done that, so well done.Speaking afterwards, Ms Aukett said she was looking forward to opening a new chapter in my le.Itaposs been horrendous, she added, labelling the assault on her completely le-changing.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Court casecompensation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

During the show, Steph asked: You have eaten will all kinds of dignities and leaders and that in your time. And youaposve eaten with the Queen as well, havenapost you  Mr Johnson replied: I did make a faux pas. She was there. There were cheese and biscuits. Her Majesty was tossing some biscuits to the dogs, to the corgis. I didnapost see that, and I took one of those biscuits and put some cheese on it and ate it and was told, aposI hate to tell you, but they are for the dogsapos. The Queen has owned about  corgis and dorgis, a cross between a corgi and a dachshund, throughout her letime, starting with Susan who she received on her th birthday in . King George VI introduced a Pembrokeshire Welsh Corgi into the royal household in , sparking the Queenaposs fascination with the breed.  The dog, who was renamed Duke from Dookie, became an integral part of the family, even making it into royal photo shoots alongside then Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth II. It has been reported Prince Phillip aposloathedapos the Queenaposs dogs because they were too yappy - but this didnapost stop her from filling Buckingham Palace with them. Despite not winning over Prince Phillip, three of the Queenaposs dogs, Monty, WIllow and Holly, won over the nation after making their TV debut alongside Her Majesty and Daniel Craig in a James Bond sketch.Filmed at Buckingham Palace, the sketch became part of the  Olympic opening ceremony – and has since been viewed more than  million times on YouTube. Her dogs have also become the focus of their own animated movie called The Queenaposs Corgis, which stars Jack Whitehall and Dame Julie Walters as voice actors. The animated movie provides an insight into what le might be like for the Queenaposs dogs, and includes mention of the aposCorgi Roomapos, where the dogs sleep in elevated wicker baskets. She is known for giving her dogsapos unusual names including Bisto Oxo, Whisky, Cider, Spick, Span, Bushy and Brush. Her Majesty currently has two corgis, one of which is called Muick, a dorgi, named Candy, and recently welcomed a cocker spaniel who has been affectionately named Lissy. The four-year-old dog is the Queenaposs first gundog champion and means she has reversed her self-imposed year-long ban on new royal dogs. Gundogs, also known as bird dogs, are hunting dogs who assist their owners in finding and retrieving game. Lissy, who is listed under the official pedigree name Wolferton Drama, recently won the st Kennel Club ocker Spaniel Championship, seeing off  competitors to gain the top spot.

Joan Blass died in March , sparking the beginning of a nightmare for her family. Her son and daughter became worried when a man  years younger became friends with her and moved in with her five months before her death. Daughter Daphne Franks, of Skipton, North Yorkshire was concerned because her mum was not aware he lived in her home and did not no know his name or where he was from.She told LeedsLive : Mum never seemed to know he lived there.She was asking, aposwhat is his name  Where did he come from apos At this stage, Joan could barely recall her own name, let alone that of her new toyboy.  When she died, the family discovered that Mr Folan had married her and the dementia sufferer was still wearing the wedding ring from her late husband Ron. Ron died in  after  years of the couple being together. Her new marriage meant her two children Daphne,  ,and Michael, , lost out on their £, inheritance because the registry office ceremony annulled her will. Daphne discovered three days after her motheraposs death that she had been married in a civil ceremony at Leeds Town Hall. Speaking to Predatory Marriage UK, Daphne said: We had contacted my motheraposs GP on so many occasions, the police, the social services, and had also taken legal advice and had been told that she could not make another will or marry again because of her severe dementia. Taking the toyboy to court The marriage meant the will Mrs Blass had drawn up, naming her two children as beneficiaries, was void and she died intestate, meaning her new husband automatically inherited her assets. Daphne decided to take legal action after Folan, now , took over the funeral arrangements. The hearing lasted four days but sadly for the family, siding with Mr Folan. Mrs Franks and her relatives were left with a £, legal bill. On top of that, none of Joanaposs relatives were invited to her funeral and she was buried in an unmarked grave.  Pushing for change Since the nightmare the family have been pushing for action to stop predatory marriages. Predatory Marriage UK aims to reform marriage laws and procedures to protect people with dementia. In  Fabian Hamilton, MP for Leeds North East, called on the PM to stop elderly and vulnerable people being preyed upon by tricksters leading to families losing their inheritance. Mr Hamilton first began campaigning on the matter a few years ago after hearing a story he could “hardly believe was possible in modern Britain”. He said: “It’s not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in the marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given. The family have been working with Hourglass charity to welcome round-the-clock help. Mrs Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. The Frank family have recently been working with Hourglass charity to get round-the-clock help for those affected by elder abuse. Ms Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. She added thatshe had known about a helpline before she would have definitely rung it. The Hourglass charity said it was moving Its helpline to a   operation because more than a quarter of the calls it received went unanswered during out of hours. It said Home Office funding meant it was now able to extend its service to make sure calls were being answered day and night. Richard Robinson, Hourglass CEO, said: Thankfully we are increasingly aware of other forms of abuse like child abuse and domestic violence, but the abuse of older people remains in the shadows even though it affects millions. So many people are suffering and donapost know where to turn for help.

The figures then rocketed again a week later by %. Downing Street was warned it was taking a major risk in introducing its Living with Covid plan last month.  It means those who test positive are no longer required to self-isolate, but are advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five days. Masks are also no longer legally required in public. As of April , lateral flow tests will no longer be free, except for over-s and over-s with weakened immune systems.  This time last year on Tuesday, February ,  the UK recorded just , new cases. However, England was just emerging from its latest lockdown - with the Prime Minister unveiling his roadmap for lockdown easing the day before on February . At that time in , schools in England had reopened, recreation in outdoor public spaces was allowed between two people - but the stay at home order remained in effect.  Following a Christmas  easing of rules, despite the highly transmissible B iant - first identied in Kent - running rampant, the Government had been forced to throw the country back into full lockdown for months. In terms of deaths, the UK recorded  last Tuesday and  the same day the previous week. On Tuesday, March , the figure was  and  two days before the new plan was brought in.  This time last year, on Tuesday, February , , a total of  deaths were recorded - a dference of % on todayaposs toll. And considering the UK had been in lockdown since the start of the previous month, it shows how far the country has come in breaking the link between infection and death.

Hybrid versions of the coronavirus that combine genes from the Delta and Omicron iants - dubbed “Deltacron” - have been identied in patients across Europe and the United States, researchers have said.It has been officially confirmed as a new iant. According to analysis of Deltacron’s genetic code, its “backbone” is derived from the Delta iant while its spike – the part of the virus that attaches itself to human cells – is from Omicron.  In fact, Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist and biostatistican, said the iant could be one of the most infectious diseases the world has ever seen.He said it is up to six times more transmissible than the original strain of Covid - hence the up surge in new cases. BA.aposs R number, the rate at which it can spread, was at  last week, compared to . for the original virus. But it appears to be far less deadly than previous strains.

The fugitive pulled off his escape act when officers turned up at the tower block in Preston, Lancashire, to arrest him. The video shows the track suited escape artist climb out of a four-storey window before using ropes to shimmy down towards Samuel Street on the Callon estate. He appears to use dog leads or belts tied together to lower himself halfway down before leaping from the second floor.  He hits the ground hard, landing next to one of the police cars, before hurling himself over a metal fence and fleeing on. Lancashire Police have named the suspect as Jamie Carlisle and say he is wanted in connection with threats to damage property in the city. The hunt is under way for the nimble-limbed -year-old and police have appealed for anyone with information to get in touch.  A police spokesman said: “Officers attended an address off Samuel Street, Preston, yesterdayas part of our enquiries to trace wanted man Jamie Carlisle. Carlisle is wanted in connection with making threats to damage property following reports of a public order earlier this month. “We are aware of a video circulating on social media showing a man climbing down from a fourth story window and jumping to the ground in order to evade police.  “We are continuing to actively search for Carlisle and we would urge anyone with information to contact us. Carlisle could be violent and we would advise the public not to approach him but instead call us with his location and a description of his clothing.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Lancashire PolicePolice carBurglaryCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While Sahar was given the all clear in , he cancer ed, and she died in March , aged .Sami toldthe Livepool Echothat the change in Sahar’s skin colour was what triggered the diagnosis.What triggered the diagnosis is she was jaundiced, so her skin was essentially going yellow, and that is what led her to go to the doctors, this was around six years ago,” he said.  She was having treatment for cancerous tumours but at that point there was an opportunity to do quite a risky operation called a Whipple procedure, which involved taking part of the organs affected by the tumours out. The procedure has a survival rate of between  and %, but Saharaposs operation was successful. This allowed the keen cyclist to live a healthy and active le for several years.  Sami added: It was like she had a new lease on le, it sounds a bit cheesy but it was certainly like a second chance at le. She was only in her s around this time, and she was generally a very bubbly, eccentric, active person.  To remember his aunt, and also help support the charity which provided amazing care for her, Sami is running four marathons across four dferent countries this year.

The plane had to be erted after she became aposdisruptiveapos and reportedly slapped other passengers. One female passenger on board has told The Mirror how her young daughter was left traumatised by the womanaposs foul behaviour and fighting. The Jet flight to Antalya left Manchester at around .am on Monday and was due to arrive in Turkey around four and a half hours later.It was erted to Vienna and landed there around .am, reports the Manchester Evening News . In the video, the irate passenger is seen screaming in the face of a unormed staff member at the front of the plane.  As other flight staff gather around her to aid their colleague, it looks as though she lashes out with her hands against someone seated in the first row. A member of staff can be seen telling her to aposstand backapos, to which she replies: I am back. Sort your head out you. The airline worker says: You are not doing yourself any favours. She replies: Yourapose not doing yourself any favours either. So what have I done  Donapost touch me, donapost ****ing touch me. She adds: What have I done  What have I done wrong on this flight, eh  See, you havenapost got an answer.  Another passenger, who asked only to be named by her first name, Emma, told The Mirror it was about  minutes into the flight when the disruption started. She said: The flight attendant was trying to calm her down. She was being really loud and arguing with the passenger in front of her. That went on for about  minutes. They gave her notice that any more trouble and further action would be taken and were telling her aposweaposre not here to be horrible to anybodyapos. She was not having any of it. She was aggressive and swearing, it was not a nice experience. You didnapost dare look at her. At one point I walked down the aisle to go to the toilet with my little girl and she said aposwhat the f*** are you looking at  Go on, have a f***ing look all of you.apos  Emma said the ‘disruptive’ passenger was “ranting and raving”. She said people made her her aware there were children on board when she was “shouting and swearing” but she “retaliated” and swore more.“She lunged forward and slapped a woman around the face,” Emma added.“A guy got up and calmed her down, who I think had just qualied as a police officer. “It was announced on the tannoy we were making an emergency landing. We landed in Vienna and stayed for about  minutes. “The flight was a nightmare from start to finish. “I was frightened. My daughter was panicking.“Nobody wanted to intervene because they didn’t want to get in trouble”. A witness on the flight said: This was a truly horrible flight for myself and my  children. My little girl was traumatised at the ladyaposs foul behaviour fighting and shouting and swearing. Sheaposs now refusing to fly home due to this it scared her so much. A man can be seen shaking his head at the womanaposs behaviour. Another video clip appears to show the moment armed police officers escorted the woman from the plane. One passenger can be heard to shout: Wait til you get the bill love. Others are shouting bye bye as the woman is led away by armed officers.  A text sent by Jet to passengers onboard the flight shortly before pm said: Hello, we are sorry that due to the disruptive behaviour of a fellow passenger, your flight has been erted to Vienna. We are working on a situation to get you on your way as soon as possible. The flight arrived at its original destination, Antalya, just after pm - one hour and  minutes later than scheduled. A Jet spokesperson said: “We can confirm that flight LS from Manchester to Antalya erted to Vienna yesterday so that a disruptive passenger could be offloaded.

How to tellyouaposve got a cold or Covid  With so many overlapping symptoms, it can be hard to dferentiate between a cold and Covid.Firstly, be aware of the main symptoms of Covid. According to the NHS, they are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteThe common cold can have similar symptoms. According to the NHS, they are:A blocked or runny noseA sore throat Headaches Muscle aches Coughs Sneezing A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellDeep Patel, LloydsPharmacy’s Vaccination Services Manager, further explained the dference between a cold and Covid. He said: People can confuse a common cold and Covid- as they’re both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by dferent viruses. Colds generally do not cause serious health problems such as pneumonia or bacterial infections, and they rarely lead to hospital care. Typical cold symptoms are sneezing a lot and a runny nose, sometimes you’ll also have a high temperature of .C or more. Unlike a cold the symptoms we see with Covid- tend to be much more severe and often include a dry and continuous cough, loss of taste and shortness of breath.

Marcelo, from Bocaiuva, Brazil, said: Today, people look at me with curiosity and interest. I donapost hear many bad comments about how I look.Women are very enchanted by my tattoos and modications and I like all of my tattoos - there isnapost one that I could say was my favourite.My kids are totally cool with my tattoos and my daughter already has some of her own. Iaposm supportive of whatever they do. “The eyes are the modication that is most popular with people because many people are curious about how to get their eyes tattooed and have questions about the risk of going blind. I wasnapost worried about going blind because I understand the process - the eye pigmentation is only done in the white part of the eye. I have about % of my body tattooed and I think I have spent around ,in expenses on tattoos and body modications.” Marcelo, who has two children and one grandchild, now works as an artistic model and actor, as well as attending tattoo events as a public figure.  His most recent operation was inserting implants which are inserted under the skin for decorative purposes in his left arm. Marcelo has no plans on slowing down however as he has more he wants done after he has filled the last remaining areas on his body not covered with ink. He added: I only have a few spaces left without tattoos like intimate areas and some small spaces on my leg, but I plan to get them tattooed soon too. I was twenty-two when I realised I wanted more tattoos, and since then I have covered myself in them.

Butyou donapost mind the eight-legged creatures, letting them roam free on your walls and ceilings might seem like a great idea, especiallytheyaposre going to snack on insects like mosquitos that would otherwise be leaving bites all over your body.Thataposs the thought process of one woman from Australia, who has been allowing a massive huntsman spider to live on the ceiling of her living room for around two weeks - and has even named him Simon. Posting anonymously on Reddit, the -year-old woman admitted Simon can sometimes freak out her house guests, and revealed she recently had trouble when she invited her friend and his arachnophobic girlfriend over to stay for a few days.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.In her post, she said: I live in Sydney, where huntsman spiders are our common house spider. I’ve had onein my living room in the ceiling corner for about  weeks now. He’s hard to reach for me to trap and put outside, and honestly, he doesn’t bother me. He can chill there for as long as he wants so long as he keeps eating smaller bugs and so long as I can see him.A couple of weeks ago I had a friend named Ben and his girlfriend Shay stay over for a couple of nights. He lives in Melbourne, she’s from Wales and has only moved here recently. They’re travelling around Australia and Ben askedthey could stay at my place in Sydney as a favour. I was happy to do so! But I did warn him that there was a huntsman in my living room since I know foreigners can freak out about them. The woman insisted she warned the couple about Simonaposs presence, but her friendaposs girlfriend was still terried by the spider and demanded it be killed.  She claimed Shay called her f***ed up for keeping a spider in the house, but said she told her friendaposs girlfriend that she was doing them a favour by letting them stay here - so Simon wouldnapost be getting the chop because of them. She added: Shay and Ben got here and we were all having dinner and watching TV when Shay notices Simon chilling in the corner. She freaks out and says I need to kill it. I said no, I’m not comfortable killing spiders and he’s not hurting you. Apparently Ben hadn’t specied how big huntsman spiders are and Shay didn’t know. Shay kept telling us we needed to kill it. I said I didn’t want to, huntsman spiders are harmless and timid and they actually eat mosquitoes and other bugs you would rather not have in here. I askedshe had a phobia of spiders, she said spiders are fine but having one inside the house is f***ed up. I got kind of mad at that because I’m doing her a favour letting her stay for free, cooking for her etc and she’s calling me f***ed up for not killing a harmless creature.  I said, aposI doubt he’s the only spider, he’s just the only one you can seeapos. This p***ed her off even more, which I obviously understand so I get I may be the asshole for that. As a compromise, the woman and her friend ended up capturing Simon in a container and setting him free outside - but Shay was still traumatised by the events and demanded she and Ben stay in a hotel instead. The woman said: In the end, Ben and I ended up getting a step ladder, trapping him and putting him outside. She was not happy with this either and said that I should have killed it after putting it outside. She basically called me an a**hole and gave me dirties the rest of the night. They ended up leaving a day early to stay in a aposclean hotelapos . This again rubbed me the wrong way because my house is clean, it just had a spider in it ! Commenters on the Reddit post were mostly on the womanaposs side, as although they acknowledged Shayaposs fear and discomfort, they also said her comments were unnecessary. One person said: I mean, I understand why they freak people out. I wouldnapost kill one but I wouldnapost want one lurking either. While another wrote: I understand her fear but her comments were so unnecessary. How would you even kill a huntsman  Theyaposre like the size of dinner plates. While I would NOPE out of that house very quickly, she was told about the spider. She could have gotten it herselfshe wanted. She also continued to be an asshole after you had done what she wanted.

She told meshe didnapost even invite her own mother then I shouldaposve understood that there was a reason. She was especially upset about me doing this behind her back. I said I am sorry multiple times but she is still angry. I slept in the guest room yesterday. I donapost think I did anything a good son wouldnapost do, but I do feel bad about hurting my we.

Bro why am I only learning today that the dominos boxes MAKE A DOMINO, she wrote over the clip. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Mind blown, she captioned the video. Molly added in a pinned comment on the clip: The two boxes put together make one domino that’s what I’m trying to relay. If that wasn’t clear. Since being posted, the video has racked up almost , likes and  comments from people who admitted that they too had no idea what the dots were for until Molly pointed it out.Bruh the whole time   I thought those were an aerial view of sumo wrestlers, one person wrote. Another commented: I literally worked there and had no idea. I actually said the oh my god on the second one at the same time as my reaction, said a third. This comes as another Dominoaposs fan shared a replica recipe for the famous garlic and herb dip. Not only is the recipe super quick and easy, but itaposs also slightly healthier than the original dip which is said to have  calories in a single size serving, whilst the large pot contains almost  calories. To make the dip, all you need to do is combine half a cup of sour cream, half a cup of mayo, a teaspoon of oregano, a tablespoon of white wine vinegar, half a teaspoon of garlic puree, a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar in a bowl and mix well. Pop it in the fridge to chill for a couple of hours whilst you wait for your pizza, then serve. Give it a try and seeit competes with the real thing.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The mystery driver was seen crossing a junction in front of other cars as he towed the portable home in his wake. The bizarre scene was filmed by Casey Hulme in north Wales, who joked on Facebook : “I can’t believe what I’ve just witnessed.“Only in Rhyl.” Her video has since been viewed .million times and had , shares by incredulous people.Casey, , told Mail Online : “I was on my way home with my friend and I saw the boy on the mobility scooter trying to pull out of a junction.“aposI turned the car around and we parked on a street off the main road the guy was going down with the caravan and watched them go past.aposI think my reaction on the video speaks for itself. We were crying with laughter.apos Thousands of people have commented on her original post. One said: “This will be me with the BMWthese prices keep on going up.” Another joked: “This is what happens when you expect to go away for a weekend and you donapost want to take the car because of the fuel prices.” Another said: “I really need to know how this ended. “I mean heaposs going to stop - but that caravan isn’t.”  The Government’s website says drivers do not need a licence for a mobility scooter but only certain types can be driven on roads. It is not the first time mobility scooters have been seen holding up traffic. Last year in Manchester a rider held up “more than  cars” by refusing to pull over in a one-way street as he waited for his chippy tea to be brought out, prompting honks from “irate” motorists.Bizarre footage of the incident shows the hungry customer parked up in the centre of the road in Manchester city centre last Friday, blocking a large truck and the cars behind from passing. Multiple people were seen attempting to help or intervene, only for the stubborn man to repeatedly shout “I just want the fish and chips that Iaposve paid for”.

You donapost see the north and the southboth melting at the same time.  Itaposs definitely an unusual occurrence. University of Wisconsin meteorologist Matthew Lazzara added: “Not a good sign when you see that sort of thing happen. “Thataposs a temperature that you should see in January, not March. January is summer there. “Thataposs dramatic. The experts believe the unusual event is a random weather event rather than a concerning sign of global warming, unless it happens regularly. The University of Maineaposs Climate Reanalyzer showed the Antarctic was around .C warmer than usual while the Arctic was .C higher. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Centre at Pennsylvania State University, told the: “The warming of the Arctic and Antarctic is cause for concern, and the increase in extreme weather events – of which these are an example – is a cause for concern as well.“The models have done a good job projecting the overall warming, but we’ve argued that extreme events are exceeding model projections. “These events drive home the urgency of action.” Meanwhile Italian scientists are hoping to study and take samples from Europeaposs southernmost glacier before it melts and disappears as a result of rising global temperatures. Researchers conducted a preliminary radar survey of the Calderone glacier in Italyaposs central Apennine Mountains on March  and plan tonext month to drill into it and take samples. The aim is to extract chunks of the glacier and store them in Antarctica for future study.

Pals are said to be hopeful that Kabaeva can persuade him to bring the bloodshed to an end.A source told Page Six : “Alina’s female friends are begging her to fly to Putin and persuade him to end the war.“He doesn’t seem to be listening to anybody, but perhaps he might listen to her.” But the insider claimed Kabaeva is fearful about how Putin will reactshe voices any opposition to the conflict. They said that the president is surrounded by rings and rings of security, adding: Alina says she doesn’t knowshe can get to him – and evenshe does – she doesn’t knowshe’ll be able to get out again to be with their kids.” The West has so far not sanctioned Kabaeva - although as well as being Putin’s rumoured secret partner, she is also chairman of the board of directors at National Media Group, a major Kremlin-obedient TV and newspaper behemoth, at a salary of almost £ million a year.

Instead, at a press conference on Monday, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe calmly explained that she’d found it hard to trust foreign secretaries after so many let her down. “What’s happened now should have happened six years ago. I shouldn’t have been in prison for six years,” she said, not even raising her voice. Within hours, the appalling hashtags #sendherback and #ungrateful were trending on Twitter. Angela from Worcestershire called in to Channel ’s The Jeremy Vine Show to say: “For her, now she’s back, in her first interview, to turn round and blame our ­government is an ungrateful thing to do.”Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Jason from Milborne Port agreed on Nick Ferrari’s LBC radio show. “It would have been nice for her to say thank you,” he moaned.For the record, the first words out of Nazanin ’s mouth at the press conference were: “I would like to begin by saying that I am very grateful to whoever has been involved in getting us home, from politicians, to media members, whoever has been trying very hard to get our voices heard.”She then gave a long list of thank yous. She used the word “grateful” so many times I lost count. But because she didn’t just sit prettily in front of the cameras and smile appreciatively, because this woman who has lost six years of her le – her marriage, her daughter’s childhood – dared address the elephant in the room, she’s now being berated. It’s outrageous, insulting, misogynistic. Cheer up, love – OK, it did happen, but you’re home now so count yourself lucky. She didn’t even mention Boris Johnson, whose ­incompetence when he was the foreign secretary tasked with helping her sealed her fate further instead. He wrongly announced she was “teaching people journalism” – a statement that days later was cited in Iranian court proceedings as proof she was engaged in ­“propaganda against the regime”. It’s something that must surely have played on her mind every now and then as she sat in her cell for years and years and years.Heroic MP Tulip Siddiq, who worked tirelessly to free her constituent, revealed this week that, “This disastrous blunder meant Johnson was forced to meet us. Incredibly, he askedRichard had enjoyed his visit to Iran.“Anyone who had read a newspaper article on the case was aware that Richard had been at home in the UK when his we was arrested in Iran. To this day, I feel astonished by Johnson’s extremely poor grasp of his brief. ” The simple truth is that Nazanin has a lot to be angry about. She was an innocent pawn in a game between two governments arguing over a £million debt for a cancelled arms deal. She was held for ransom, and left to rot. Then, six long years later, the Tories who run this country may need Iranian oil, so they suddenly decide to do the right thing and rescue her… and she’s supposed to be grateful  Are you kidding  Jeremy Hunt, one of the other foreign secretaries who failed her said yesterday: “Those criticising Nazanin have got it so wrong. She doesn’t owe us gratitude: we owe her an explanation.” Too right.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ParentingNazanin Zaghari-RatclfeIranWomen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere  In a call with Pope Francis, he askedthe Catholic Church could play a “mediating role”. The president said he discussed the “dficult humanitarian situation and the blocking of rescue corridors by Russian troops.” So far the Kremlin has not responded to the Vatican’s numerous offers to help set up negotiations. President Zelensky also addressed the Italian parliament and referred to his y conversation with the Pope. Meanwhile Ukrainian officials said Moscow has lost its “offensive potential” and is being forced to call in reinforcements from the “depths” of Russia as it retreats in key battles.It said some troops are deserting, forcing generals to take drastic decisions. The Ukraine armed forces said Russian troops had been “repelled” from Makariv, a strategically important Kyiv suburb, and the Ukrainian flag was raised over the town “thanks to the heroic actions of our defenders”. The recapture of Makariv, about  miles west of Kyiv, could prevent Russian forces from encircling the capital from the northwest.  It comes as a senior Ukrainian general has claimed that the Kremlin is preparing its population for a “long war” and implementing draconian mobilisation measures, including deploying members of the youth military organisation, who are aged between  and . Officials claim , Russian soldiers have died so far, although these figures cannot be veried. Saboteurs sent into Ukraine at the beginning of the conflict continue to be caught. They include a man disguised as a monk who was detained in Kyiv, First Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin revealed last night.“The enemy is using ious cover-ups,” he revealed. “A saboteur dressed in monastic clothes has been detained in Kyiv. Instructions, photos of checkpoints, military facilities and calls to Russia have been found on his phone.”In Britain, the Ministry of Defence said Russian forces have “endured yet another day of limited progress, with most forces largely stalled in place”.The Ukrainian military also claims the invading army only has stockpiles of ammunition and food to last for “no more than three days”. And a senior US defence official said a lack of correct equipment has led to some soldiers suffering from frostbite. It says the operation to take over Ukraine is being mobilised “chaotically”, leading to increasingly desperate tactics seen in the southern cities and around the capital Kyiv.US President Joe Biden warned that Putin might resort to biological and chemical weapons as his “back is against the wall”.He believes the Russian leadership is prepared to carry out so-called “ flag” operations to justy its propaganda, including that America actually has chemical weapons ready to be launched in Europe. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine,” he went on. “That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Putin “knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front,” he added, without specying what actions the alliance would take. President Biden also confirmed that Russia has used hypersonic missiles against key targets in Ukraine.  Kyiv’s deputy head of police has accused Russian forces of using white phosphorus in the city of Kramatorsk, in the northern part of Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared a clip of a substance releasing white smoke into the air as it burned on the ground. Mr Biloshytskiy wrote: “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk.” White phosphorus is a toxic substance that is self-igniting when it interacts with oxygen.In a signal of how willing Russia is to target its firepower on civilians, Ukraine’s Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said ten hospitals have now been completely destroyed since Russia invaded Ukraine.He said others could not be restocked with medicines and supplies. Despite signicant Ukrainian resistance, the mayor of Boryspil city near Kyiv has told residents to “leave town ASAP” as fighting against Russian forces draws closer.

Up to , civilians are believed to have died since Russian troops encircled, besieged and bombarded the coastal city, with bodies lying on the streets and children dying of thirst. Trapped residents have been running out of food and water, with an estimated , people living without heating or electricity. Last week, small groups started to flee in cars and risk losing their lives during the escape, rather than face death by staying. Maryna Boreiko, , got word on Friday that her mother and -year-old grandmother were still alive after losing contact on March . Her boyfriend Serhii Rozhkov drove for  hours to rescue Maryna’s mum Polina Boreiko and his own parents from the ravaged city, with the group taking shelter in Berdynask  miles away. The mother and daughter were finally reunited on Sunday.  She said: “My grandmother has had to stay, she cannot manage such a dangerous road. She is staying with my cousin. He is a nurse, which makes me calmer. “My brother and his we also got out of Mariupol. They are in a village nearby as they ran out of gas. “They haven’t been able to tell me much about conditions in Mariupol because they are afraid of being overheard by Russian occupiers. Maryna and her boyfriend fled their home in Kharkiv when it was hit by shelling the day war broke out, taking refuge at a friend’s empty flat in Kryvyi Rig. But the Mariupol natives had advised their families to stay put and not panic. The marketing specialist said: “I’m blaming myself. I could have insisted they leave Mariupol the day the war started. Instead I said to them it will be okay, donapost panic.  And my mummy didnapost panic. In the first days of the war, she even went to work. “She works with small organisations that supply stories with essentials. And she was joking: aposIf I leave the city, then who will take orders for toilet paper apos Now this joke doesnapost seem funny to me.” Maryna is still anxiously waiting for news of her -year-old goddaughter Lera and her family however. She said: I’m afraid my goddaughter could be in the drama theatre that was bombed. Her family lived nearby.” Maryna has a treasured picture of herself with the schoolgirl in a square that has been completely destroyed by bombs. She said: I donapost care about the square but I am afraid to think my sweet girl might not be alive any more. Her friend Veronica Vishnevski also lost direct contact with her extended family on March  but got word on Friday that her mother Lilia Maltseva, , was alive.Russian-born Lilia’s last words to her had been: “Care only about Ukraine, donapost think about me too much.”She said: “My mum told me she escaped from our district on March , because Ukrainian soldiers came to civilians and said that the district could be harshly bombed.

They met adorable Ukrainian people, who fed them and treated them really good. “My family tried to pay for food and bed, but the hosts started crying. “Mum said she was extremely exhausted and also wanted to have a bath as she has been two weeks without a shower.” Her mum has now moved onto Dnipro,  miles north-west of Mariupol.  Veronica and her husband Anton, who is Ukrainian Jewish, emigrated to Israel four months ago without knowing war would come to their homeland. Her mum is a retired electrician who was widowed  years ago and is travelling with her sister-in-law Natalia and nephew Fedor, as her brother Ilia is a sailor and on a ship in Mississippi. “We’ve discussed it and my mum has agreed to live in Israel, as it is possible for family members to come here,” she said. “My friends still don’t know anything about their parents. I don’t know why I am so lucky. “I hope that all Mariupol citizens will find a way from this hell.

Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed yesterday to have discovered a plot to remove Putin from his presidency, over fears that economic sanctions will cripple the country.The elite circle in Moscow is said to fear that the countryaposs brutal war could lead to further ramications for them. Now they are reportedly considering a range of options to replace him - including faking an accident or poisoning the brutal leader. His former friend Alexander Bortnikov, who was previously sanctioned by the US, is said to be in the running to replace him.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here  He is the current director of Russiaaposs FSB - a role previously held by Putin - and was regarded as an influential member of the Presidentaposs small inner circle. Bortnikov previously served in the KGB and met Putin while they were both stationed in Leningrad - now Saint Petersburg - in the s. Since being appointed to the top role in , he is said to rule with an iron fist, to ensure Putinaposs regime continues. The shadowy organisation - which Putin relies on for all his intelligence - is at the heart of the Russian government, with Dossier Center describing it as a “state within the state. After Putin became President, he appointed Bortnikov as the head of Russiaaposs Economic Security Service, where he wielded a huge amount of power. In , it was claimed that Bortnikov allegedly oversaw the operation to assassinate Alexander Litvinenko on British soil. The agency is also believed to be responsible for the poisoning of Alexei Navalny under Mr Bortnikov’s order. Russia and Bortnikov deny any involvement in the deaths.  And in , Bortnikov was accused of holding a pro-Stalin attitude, after a group of academics claimed he was legitimising the mass purges carried out under Joseph Stalin, which were dubbed the Great Terror. At the time, he told a paper that archives showed that a signicant part of the criminal cases of those killed had an objective side to them.Now intelligence agents claim powerful figures in Russia have chosen the spymaster as they believe he can help restore economic ties with the West. Their goal is to remove Putin from power as soon as possible and restore economic ties with the West, destroyed due to the war in Ukraine, the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine said.It is known that Bortnikov and some other influential representatives of the Russian elite are considering ious options to remove Putin from power. In particular, poisoning, sudden disease, or any other ‘coincidence’ is not excluded. Itaposs thought the relationship between Putin and Bortnikov has become strained - with the spymaster blamed for allowing his military commanders to be overwhelmed by the fierce Ukrainian defence. Putin is said to be displeased with the FSB thanks to failures with the intelligence secured during the war. Deputy Vyacheslav Ushakov has already been sacked. One intelligence source told the Mirror: It is noteworthy that Bortnikov has recently been disgraced by the Russian dictator. “The official reason for the disgrace of the FSB leader – fatal miscalculations in the war against Ukraine. “Bortnikov and his department were responsible for analysing the mood of Ukraine and the ability of the Ukrainian army.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Alexander BortnikovJoe BidenAlexander LitvinenkoJoseph StalinDmitry MedvedevVladimir PutinBritish ArmyThe Washington Post CompanyArmed forcesShopping centres\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

the street, with only one flat above using the same toilet waste downpipe, I was amazed tohome to find a previous #deposit# still in my toilet.My attempt to clear and flush caused the toilet basin to fill to the brim with #dirty# water etcetera and white paper.The emergency plumbers were called and two good men arrived but efforts to clear the toilet basin in the flat failed.At ground level outside, they effected an entry into the said downpipe and pulled out unpleasant #deposits# and many many wet wipes – which I do not use.They claimed to have previously attended similarly choked toilets with wet wipes. On their advice, I called Scottish Water to report the situation.Their officers attended and completed the clearance into the main drain.It is encouraging to hear that the water companies are taking action to attempt to prevent other householders from sharing my horrible wet wipes experience.Following the recent report from the Public Audit committee, I am calling for a review of governance structures, especially in relation to the Crofting Commission.Crofting in the Highlands and Islands is a huge economic driver that retains people and fights against depopulation.To see that no real improvements have been made to improve the Crofting Commission since concerns were firstly raised is disappointing and concerning and I would like to see this urgently addressed to avoid this occurring again.That is why I believe it would be best to review these governance structures so that the roles within the Crofting Commission – and other bodies – are clear and that its relationship with its board and the Scottish Government are clearly defined."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 4 2022","story":"Teachers of wisdom spring up like weeds after rain.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer.

I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle. I hope the new centre will make young people think they are part of the community woodland and will want to be involved.I am committed to delivering this project on the ground quickly, as I did with the Hallhill Sports Complex that was £ million.

the groundwork before the stand is in place in time for the new season.The club’s chairman took time to praise the community, who had once again got behind the club with about £, raised through a sponsor-a-seat campaign.He said: “I think that New Countess Park is already a top-end facility in the region but this makes it stand out as the best in the region.“There are better in the league, like Linlithgow Rose, but certainly not in East Lothian.“It is all about seeing the other clubs improving all the time and we want to be part of it.“As well as having got the SFA licence last year, this was the next step for the board.“A lot of our fans cannot stand for two hours and hopefully this adds to a really strong following we have got this season.”Eve Coaches, which is the club’s shirt sponsor, has also agreed a -year sponsorship deal on the new stand.The season is due to come to an end on May , when Dunbar head for Tynecastle, but Mr Robertson revealed there were already

Events such as graduations were cancelled and the large gatherings were replaced with virtual graduations.However, two years on the Edinburgh-based artist is no planning her own special kind of graduation with a solo show which opens this Sunday on Mothers Day.  Described as a modern expressionist painter, Ms Gaskell, finished her degree in Fine Art at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design in  but, like many others during the pandemic, left university quietly, without a fanfare.This Sunday not only marks the opening of her solo show at the Green Gallery in Buchlyvie, near Stirling, her family are treating the event as her graduation ceremony, and will be celebrating accordingly.Read more: Minute silence to be held at Scotlands Covid memorial on second lockdown anniversaryStill only -years-old, Ms Gaskell’s bold use of colours makes for a visual feast, arresting the eye and drawing you into her almost three-dimensional, dream-like, luminous landscapes.Although born in Scotland, her father’s work as a doctor took the family of six, she has a twin brother and two elder sisters, to the Black Isle when she was eight and then on to Bangladesh, where her dad practised medicine for the Foreign Office.  “In the Black Isle we lived on an estate that I called my ‘wild garden.’ I loved nothing better than going out exploring, roaming around the fields, forests and rivers by myself,\" Ms Gaskell said.\"This love of landscapes grew when I moved to Dhaka in Bangladesh. There I experienced ‘Holi, the two-day Hindu spring festival, also known as ‘the festival of colours,’ which made a huge impact on me. You just couldn’t escape being surrounded by all the colours of the rainbow and to me these colours also represented the warmth and generosity of the people.”Ms Gaskell moved back to Scotland to continue her education at boarding school where an art teacher spotted her talent and encouraged her to experiment with colour and form. Although separated geographically, she remained close to her parents, calling them my \"biggest supporters”.“Both my mum and dad are very creative people and my mum has the most amazing eye. Wherever we lived in the world she had a real flair for making a home.”Her first major solo exhibition, ‘Fragments of Home,’ showcases a range of colourfully compelling pieces reflecting m Gaskells interpretation and memory of the dferent places she has lived - including the Australian Outback for a time after her parents orced.The family will be reunited on Sunday for her show - her father is coming over from Australia especially for the occasion.She remarked: “I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate my graduation - and Mother’s Day.”  The Green Gallery is owned by Becky Walker who will also be marking Mother’s Day at Ms Gaskell’s exhibition. Ms Walkers mum, Ann Johnston, a professional painter, established the the gallery nearly  years ago and has also taught many well-known artists.Ms Walker, who now runs the business, said: “Mum is always on hand with advice and I’m very aware of her legacy of only showing good work of the highest quality.\"Erraid continues this tradition. She has very distinctive style and a level of artistic maturity that’s unusual for someone her age. As soon as I saw her paintings I knew she would be an artist very much in demand and I’m delighted to be giving people the opportunity to buy a piece of art to help create their own sense of home.”‘Fragments of Home,’ featuring the work of Erraid Gaskell will preview on Sunday, March  at the Greengallery from -pm.

At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too. The tours we used to do in August were also very popular, playing a game at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire while the royal family was in residence.”Communication through their Facebook page has been encouraging, boosting Mr Rae and others that there is renewed interest in raising the profile of the sport once more.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The shadow of that onslaught lingered over the rest of his involvement, and cost him a place on a turning track in Adelaide, but the -year-old has come through the experience with a clearer mind.“I felt horrible after Brisbane, yeah. Not a good moment,” he said.“But sometimes the worst thing you can do is just sit in your room and stew about it. I trained the next day after the game – let’s do something about it, that’s normally the best thing. I’ve surprised myself with how I’ve dealt with the lows. vw,vw,px, px\"Leach endured a tough time in Brisbane “Australia was a really tough trip for everyone but I did feel like I learned a lot and I came back really motivated and buzzing. I want to reach my ceiling as a cricketer, basically, and put everything into that. Then I can rest easy that I’ve given it everything.”Leach appears to be one of the most obvious beneficiaries of England’s much trumpeted ‘red ball reset’, appearing as secure in the role of first-choice spinner as he has ever been.The result is a less pre-occupied, more focused cricketer.“Before, I’ve felt a lot of pressure on my own inidual game and it was just about trying to keep my place in the team. You can kind of forget that you are contributing to something bigger,” he said.“It almost takes the pressure off your own game when you are playing for something bigger than yourself.

It’s easy to feel sorry for yourself at -odd overs and you’re like ‘God, when is this going to end ’ But I was pleased with how I managed to get back out there and put in another decent performance.“It’s something I’ve never had to do before.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

He doesn’t always understand why there is a change. Monday, after being off over St Patrick’s weekend, was slightly less worrying. He still doesn’t quite understand why he isn’t going to school, but he was more accepting of it this morning.“As the day has gone on he has needed more and more reassurance. He’s constantly giving us his schedule and showing us his pictures for school.“Unfortunately we’re now telling him he’s not going to school again. He’s already showing his displeasure around that.“It may come across that this is an issue primarily with transport, but that’s not the case with my son’s school,” said Seamus.“If it was just a case of transport, myself and probably a lot of other parents would be able to try and make other arrangements to get the kids into school. But the school is not able toin-house as they don’t have the classroom and general assistants who are also on strike.“It could be more days off school as the week goes on,” he said.Speaking on BBC’s Good Morning Ulster, Seamus said the inability of the union and the EA to arrive at a compromise was frustrating.“The information we have is that they were hoping to not to have to close during this week,” he said. “The EA and the union were in consultation about trying to get an exemption for special schools, which we have now seen had not been the case. The union has said no.“Again, we’re just waiting for more information on what’s going to happen on Wednesday, and possibly Thursday and Friday.“I don’t think anybody would have any issues with the reasons that workers have for taking strike action. I’m sure it wasn’t an easy decision to go ahead with the strike, however, the likes of the special schools should always be exempt from industrial action.“We’re not talking about mainstream schools and kids who can carry on their learning at home, through online lessons. We’re talking about the most vulnerable in society who have already suffered immensely during the past couple of years with the pandemic.“Special schools always seem to be hit harder when something happens,” he said. “Some exemption should have been given to allow a school to be able to provide for those very vulnerable kids who suffer greatly when they can’t go in.“I’m not a politician, or an expert, but surely there could have been some sort of compromise “I can only speak for my son, but going back to the bad days of the pandemic, we’re talking meltdowns, complete and utter frustration, crying. He lives for his schedule and it’s not just about getting an education, it’s getting the therapies that are part of that special school. Like a lot of children, it’s not just the case of missing a certain lesson.“If Eoin continues to not be at school he will show extreme frustration. His behaviour will deteriorate.

This step should in fact have been taken when it was already evident fuel costs would rise so substantially.”Read MoreCost of living crisis: Average cost of Northern Ireland home heating oil falls in last seven daysDUP MLA Pam Cameron, deputy chair of Stormont’s Health Committee, added: “Travel is not an optional extra within their job but a necessary part of helping some of the most vulnerable in our society.“Even without the recent increase in fuel prices there was justication for the mileage rate to be reviewed and it needs to fully cover both fuel and the wear and tear on vehicles used. It is unthinkable that staff should be left out of pocket for doing their job.”Meanwhile, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has called on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to cut VAT and excise duty on diesel and petrol to help those struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. In a letter, Sir Jeffrey also urged the Chancellor to pause plans to remove the red diesel rebate, cancel the planned .% increase in national insurance contributions and to offer targeted extra support to working families and those in greatest need with heating costs.“It is vital that you not only recognise the scale of the problem we face, but take resolute action to offer hope to millions of people across the UK,” he said in the letter.Related topicsPaula BradshawPam CameronSir Jeffrey DonaldsonDepartment of HealthCost of LivingMore On Paula Bradshaw‘Inaction’ over helping children in Northern Ireland care homes must stop, say MLAs PremiumAlliance leader Naomi Long: ‘We can become the biggest party...

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies,

controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

chairwoman, Cathy Mason, following a recent meeting she had with senior council directors who provided her with a progress report.A detailed report on building the eagerly-awaited pound leisure centre is expected to be completed shortly, with senior council officials working with consultants to develop an outline business case which is designed to pave the way for construction work to start.The rear of the existing Newcastle Centre and the outdoor Tropicana swimming pool are to be bulldozed to make way for the new town centre leisure complex which will feature an indoor leisure pool which includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely

club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting

Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

Operating seven days per week, over  cataract operations were undertaken and over  post-operative reviews were also delivered.Mr Swann described his visit as a ldquovery welcome opportunity to see the excellent facilities at the Downe Hospital and to meet the dedicated teams who have shown such tremendous commitment to patient care right through the pandemic.ldquoStaff have had to adapt at pace to new ways of working and I want to commend them for their hard work and innovative approaches to maintaining and rebuilding services, he said.While at the Struell Road hospital, Mr Swann also visited the urgent care centre which in October  at the height of the coronavirus pandemic became the first ldquophone first consultant-led service in the South Eastern Trust area.Dr Catherine Bell explained to the Minister that on average,  people use the service every month, ensuring they receive the right care, in the right place, first time.Health trust officials say that prior to the introduction of the ldquopone first service, around  patients per week had to be transferred to the Ulster Hospital. That figure has now reduced to two.Mr Swann was also informed that in January this year, % of patients were seen in the urgent care centre within two hours of arriving, % of patients seen within four hours.The health minister also heard details about the hospitalrsquos busy minor injuries unit which operates every weekend. Before leaving, Mr Swann took the opportunity to visit and chat to patients in Ward .The health trust chief executive said she was delighted that Mr Swann took time out of his ldquohectic schedule to meet staff and patients.Mrs Coulter added: ldquoThe hospital plays a pivotal role in the Trustrsquos hospital network and provides vital services for the community.

In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon decided to keep mask rules in place there for another month, despite ending the rest of the nations Covid rules on Monday.It means people in Scotland must continue to wear face coverings on public transport and in shops - the same rules that we currently have in Wales - throughout April.England, however, has operated without any coronavirus rules for nearly one month, after Boris Johnson introduced his Living With Covid plan at the end of February.Public Health Wales confirmed , new cases on Monday , and nearly one in seven patients currently in Welsh hospitals has coronavirus. But infection rates remain well below the levels seen during the height of the Omicron wave in December and January. :Given the current Covid situation, the Argus asked the Welsh Governmentit was confident the nations remaining Covid restrictions would be lted when ministers reviewed the rules this week.We also askedthe Welsh Government believed it was currently safe to lt those restrictions.A spokesman for the government did not respond directly to those questions, but said: \"Throughout the pandemic we have kept regulations under regular review, with our approach being informed by the latest available scientic and medical advice. The outcome of the current -day review of regulations will be confirmed on March .\".removeEvenWales abandons its Covid rules on Friday, it is highly unlikely Mr Drakeford will follow the \"clf-edge\" approach seen in England. The first minister has criticised Mr Johnson for the abrupt end to restrictions over the border, and reinforced his own beliefs in the \"step by step\" strategy preferred in Wales.That strategy will involve a gradual winding down of most of the public-service response to coronavirus in Wales.Testing will continue here for the next three months, but lateral flow tests will be used instead of more expensive PCR tests during that time.Likewise, self-isolation policies will continue until the end of June, but they will become a matter of advice - not a legal requirement - from the end of March.We will bring you all the updates from Eluned Morgans Welsh Government coronavirus press conference at midday today, Tuesday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith England having removed all of its covid restrictions, it comes as little surprise that the Welsh Government is fielding calls to follow in Boris Johnson’s footsteps.Following this, it was announced that a decision will be made on the future of restrictions in Wales on Thursday, March , ahead of first minister Mark Drakeford’s three week review the following day - Friday, March .If the public health situation allows for it, an announcement lting restrictions in Wales will follow, the Welsh Government said.But, the BA. strain of covid has recently emerged, and it is growing – having overtaken omicron as the most prevalent iant in Wales.As a result, the situation is finely poised, with restrictions disappearing, additional measures being put in place, or continuing in an uneasy middle ground all on the table.Speaking at a briefing earlier today - Tuesday, March  - health minister Eluned Morgan summed it up, saying: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.”Below, you can find out more about all of the moving parts in place, before the decision can be made.Why restrictions should be ltedNeighbouring England has lted all of its restrictions, and with many commuting across the border from Newport and Gwent - and vice-versa - there is a logical argument to bring the two nations in line.From a data point of view, Wales is actually in the best place of any of the home nations to lt restrictions.Wales currently has the lowest case rate in the UK - lower than England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.Health minister Eluned Morgan and The Grange hospital, one of the frontline hospitals in the fight against the virus What’s more, the omicron covid wave appears to be under control.Ms Morgan said: “Since the end of January, we have seen a steady decline in cases of coronavirus as the winter omicron wave receded”..removeSo, based on the above, all restrictions should be lted  Unfortunately, there are a number of other factors at play.Why restrictions should remainWhile omicron might be on the decline, there is a new menace in town – the BA. covid strain.In the last three weeks, the number of covid cases per , people in Wales has more than doubled, well above  per , people.BA. has also overtaken omicron as the most prevalent strain.BA. has now overtaken omicron But perhaps the biggest reason to keep restrictions in place is the pressure that the NHS once again finds itself under.There are more than , people in hospital with the virus, and, while most of these are not in intensive care, it is the highest hospitalisation rate since March .Simply put, the NHS is creaking once again.So, what decision can we expect It might sound like a bit of a cliché, but the decision as to whether restrictions will be lted could come down to the wire.The Welsh Government is set to make a decision on Thursday, before announcing it on Friday.Ms Morgan said: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.\"There are no foregone conclusions. Were analysing the data, were giving ourselves as much time as we can. We will act in the best interest of the NHS and the public health in Wales.\"We have got to consider the pressures on the NHS at the minute. Our hospitals are full already. Any additional new pressure is going to lead to more dficulties in terms of access to accident and emergencies, dficulties with getting ambulances to people. All of those things will be considered as well.\"These are dficult judgements. Weve always tried to follow the science, but this is going to be a finely balanced judgement.\"It may be that well be keeping some restrictions, but there are no decisions that have been made so far.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLeach’s fingerprints, and specically his finger-spin, have been all over the two drawn Tests in Antigua and Barbados.He is the top wicket-taker in a batting-friendly series with , four clear of the chasing pack and six ahead of opposite number Veerasammy Permaul, and is even further clear in terms of workload.A word on this guy.. overs in the match.A mammoth effort 👏🏝 #WIvENG 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 | @jackleach 🥜 pic kfkzCBPQK— England CricketMarch , At the Kensington Oval last week he sent down a remarkable . overs – the most by an Englishman in a single match since Tony Lock in .And while he has not been able to bowl the team to victory on a pair of leless surfaces – a third chance awaits on a better looking pitch in Grenada from Thursday – his role has visibly grown.In Australia he was used more sparingly across three games, starting at the Gabba where he was smashed around for  in  wicketless overs. The shadow of that onslaught lingered over the rest of his involvement, and cost him a place on a turning track in Adelaide, but the -year-old has come through the experience with a clearer mind.“I felt horrible after Brisbane, yeah. Not a good moment,” he said.“But sometimes the worst thing you can do is just sit in your room and stew about it. I trained the next day after the game – let’s do something about it, that’s normally the best thing. I’ve surprised myself with how I’ve dealt with the lows. vw,vw,px, px\"Leach endured a tough time in Brisbane “Australia was a really tough trip for everyone but I did feel like I learned a lot and I came back really motivated and buzzing. I want to reach my ceiling as a cricketer, basically, and put everything into that. Then I can rest easy that I’ve given it everything.”.removeLeach appears to be one of the most obvious beneficiaries of England’s much trumpeted ‘red ball reset’, appearing as secure in the role of first-choice spinner as he has ever been.The result is a less pre-occupied, more focused cricketer.“Before, I’ve felt a lot of pressure on my own inidual game and it was just about trying to keep my place in the team. You can kind of forget that you are contributing to something bigger,” he said.“It almost takes the pressure off your own game when you are playing for something bigger than yourself. I said openly to the group that at Somerset I feel I belong, so I feel more comfortable giving my points of view, maybe because I felt I belonged in terms of what I offer on the cricket field.“But we all have stuff to offer, we wouldn’t be herewe are not good enough. I think maybe I got it a bit wrong beforehand. Not on purpose or from a selfish point of view…I just felt I was playing for my spot.Jack Leach - .Ben Stokes - Kemar Roach -Jason Holder - .“I’m trying to become the frontline spinner for England and I really see the last couple of weeks as really valuable for my development on that road.”England are crossing their fingers for less benign conditions for the series decider in St George’s. Seamers Craig Overton and Ollie Robinson, who are both expecting to be fit for the game after missing out through injury and illness in Barbados, trained with batter Ollie Pope on Tuesday and reported some encouraging signs of grass on the match strip.Any assistance in unsettling West Indies skipper Kraigg Brathwaite would be welcome, after he faced  deliveries in Barbados. Just one of those dismissed him, Leach finally sneaking one through after more than  attempts in the first innings before drawing a blank in the second.“It was a lot of overs!” he said of their y battle.“The fingers get stf, your neck in the morning, just getting them going, it just a general tiredness throughout the body. It’s easy to feel sorry for yourself at -odd overs and you’re like ‘God, when is this going to end ’ But I was pleased with how I managed to get back out there and put in another decent performance.“It’s something I’ve never had to do before. It was challenging but those are the kind of challenges that I want.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Jack Leach happy to take frontline role after  uhorrible u Ashes tour article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Exhibitors will include Flood Marine, McAlinden Boats, Swim Ireland, Royal Yacht Association to name but a few, and it will be packed full of activities from fun and interactive workshops, to on the water demonstrations and experiences.“We’ve hosted successful events for over  years now, including the Ireland Angling Show in Dublin, so we honestly believe that the increasing passion and interest in marine leisure over recent years calls for a bigger and better show.“For those interested in perfecting their techniques or learning about new products, the show will feature talks from a range of experts in all areas of the marine leisure sector, while also giving guests the opportunity to chat to professionals and visit our exhibitor stands.“We are also delighted to have the support of Lisburn Castlereagh City Council who recognise the enormous potential of Northern Ireland in providing these kinds of homegrown holiday activities.“This is a very lucrative market for everyone in the wider tourism industry and from this exhibition alone we estimate that around £, will go into the local economy. Northern Ireland has so much to offer with quality accommodation and catering, superb activity facilities and of course unparalleled access to water be it lakes, rivers or coast, said Hugh.”Officiating at the event launch and welcoming it to the city, Alderman Amanda Grehan, Chair of Lisburn  Castlereagh City Council’s Development Committee, said that this is exactly the kind of event to show off the versatility of their tourism offering.“Eikon Exhibition Centre which is conveniently located beside the main arterial routes to Belfast and Dublin is now a signicant centre for International events being held in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It will draw in thousands of visitors and millions of pounds in consumer spend and sectoral investment.“Supporting events like this is a core part of our economic strategy for the council area demonstrating that we are also a critical economic generator benefiting the whole of Northern Ireland.“The countdown has now started, and I look forward to visiting Ireland on the Water Expo next year.

It’s fantastic that we can come together once again as a community, and it’s just the beginning of a packed programme of major festivities being rolled out in . I’m delighted that this year’s Spring Carnival also features the Unboxed Festival of Creativity, and I would really encourage people to check out this fabulous showcase in Guildhall Square.“I know our businesses will be particularly pleased to see people back out on the streets, and back through their doors after such a challenging time. With large crowds expected, I want to appeal to everyone to please give each other plenty of space and to consider taking a lateral flow test for extra peace of mind before attending.“Check out the traffic and travel information before you go to plan your journey andpossible use public transport or walk to the event to help reduce congestion in the city centre. Follow the direction of stewards and the PSNI who are on hand to help on the day.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president. Entry forms have been sent electronically to all playgroups, nursery, primary and special schools. Schools’ competition templates are available by visitingwww.ufuni.org.The closing date for entries is Friday  April .
