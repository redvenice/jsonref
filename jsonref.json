At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ... Never click on a link in the email or attachment, and refuse any request for money or details. Scan any suspicious text or email for clues.

Now, weeks in, it has turned into a sprawling project documenting Australia’s new domesticityIn these strange, suspended times, a camera and lens can be an emotional bridge from one person to the next.As a film-maker you become reliant on the manic energy of shooting and the warmth of your community – crews, actors, colleagues or subjects – to keep you buoyant.Lately, I’ve been taking a lot of photos instead – through open doors and from the other side of the windows, respecting physical distancing – to try and capture the faces of friends and colleagues locked down inside their homes.There’s Nick, pulling a lace curtain aside, staring at me from behind glass. Last year, Nick was forced to retire from his family’s much-loved bar in Fitzroy, after a massive stroke. Now, Covid has put his entire family out of work. At the bar, his wife was the cook, his daughter the bar manager, and two of his sons were Flamenco performers. “The hardest thing has been not being able to see my children and my grandchildren,” he told me. “We won’t be able to connect with hugs and kisses anymore.”Luke is a community healthcare worker who has continued working, without contact, throughout the crisis. His flatmates, a gardener and an IT worker, are both without work. “I am proud of the whole Victorian community for responding in the way we needed to,” he says. “It’s been particularly inspirational to see the Victorian Aboriginal community support each other in a myriad of innovative and necessary ways.” “The Simpsons are keeping me good company,” Flynn tells me. “People seemed to worry about becoming claustrophobic, but the longer it goes on, the more the opposite seems to be true.” Flynn lives alone and has been able to continue his work as UI designer remotely. He feels lucky to be working, but his major client is in the airline industry so there is less work coming in now. Fortunately, it means he has been able to spend more time on his passion – music and film composition. When major restrictions were announced Natesha, a playwright, was on her way to the airport. She was meant to fly to Sydney for the opening night of her play ‘girl friend’ at Belvoir St Theatre. “I didn’t actually realise how drastically my life would change. In a single night, my career came to a virtual standstill and my living situation was pulled out from under my feet,” she says.She was able to see one performance of the play – which a team of theatre makers had worked for months on – before the show, and any possibility of ticket sales and proceeds, was cancelled. “With the support of some incredible friends and colleagues – I now have a roof over my head and work coming out my ears. I am immensely grateful for Australia’s health infrastructure and devastated to see racism boldly rear its ugly head. Time has also lost all meaning for me, but to be honest – I’m kinda into it.”“It’s hard sometimes to find the iding line between isolation and the final stages of my first pregnancy,” says Tania, a teacher and musician. “Now the fears I had about the pandemic have given way to a happy embrace of solitude.” Because Tania works at a large university, she is not worried about job security – but she is still fearful for the future. For now, she and her partner – a successful musician and producer – are both working from home. It means they’re able to enjoy their final moments alone together, as they wait for their child to arrive.Steph combines work as an architect and a yoga teacher. “Teaching yoga online has … been a huge learning curve I’m not sure I’ve mastered that one yet. But I’ve found liberation in taking the time.”Mahmood abandoned his role as sergeant-at-arms of the Mongols biker club to become a writer. Holed up in the family home, he’s been working furiously. “Reading has been turning me on. Wagner makes me feel like I’ve got butterflies, but Google tells me that’s a sign of short-term anxiety. I’ve learnt a bit about what’s lost when you talk to people who aren’t actually with you. Although, it’s nice that prisons are video streaming visits now – so you can see the faces of old friends without feeling violated by the system they’re in.”Isolating alone in her apartment Kim, who works in fashion marketing, has learned to embrace dancing to keep the days passing.“Being holed up, alone in self isolation, has made me see the outside world with brand new eyes,” says Bryan, a writer and Yorta Yorta man who usually moves between homes in Cummeragunja and Melbourne. Bryan was house sitting an artist friend’s dog in Reservoir when isolation was imposed. His friends have been trapped in Thailand by the restrictions, so Bryan has had to stay on, to care for the dog. “I caught a glimpse of the familiar moon when I was wheeling the garbage out a few nights ago and passed back through the house to encourage the dog, Trent, to join me in the backyard. We were out there for over an hour – mesmerised by the moon ... I miss my grandparents and my mob back home at Cummeragunja. My mother works at the local Aboriginal medical clinic there and she told me how wonderful everyone has been in observing hygiene, social distancing and ensuring that contact with the outside world is kept to a minimum. Our elders are to us, what diamonds might be to a materialistic person – highly prized and precious, and so I was so grateful to hear what my mum had to say about how our mob are looking after themselves so as to look after our elders. The thought of hugging and holding my family right now literally makes me cry.”When I first started taking these portraits through windows and doorways, I thought it might just be a handful of friends I shot with. Slowly it’s grown to strangers and the wider community and now I’m collaborating with an old friend in Sydney, photographer Stuart Miller, who is doing a companion series there, and my brother who is making an internet archive for us.There are a terrifying amount of people – freelancers, people on temporary visas, artists, sex workers, community organisers – who are just as deserving of work, security and support as anyone else. But they have fallen through the holes in our current system . Their aspiration are to be part of the community at large, to make things, cook things, provide nourishment, or tell stories as a way to provide for themselves. I’m lucky to be connected to them and to be able to capture this strange moment.

His best-known novels are about Frank Bascombe, sportswriter turned real estate agent. His novel Independence Day won the Pulitzer prize in 1996. He lives in Maine, teaches English at Columbia and his new collection of short stories, Sorry for Your Trouble, is exemplary in its nuanced understanding of the relationships between men and women.Your stories explore choice and the rogue ways life behaves. Do people have a choice about who they fall in love with? And what part does luck play?I think about both these questions. I was the luckiest man in the world when I met Kristina back in 1964 – I’ve been married to the same girl for 52 years. Yet throughout that long period, you choose all over again. I used to tell Kristina, “I choose to be married to you every day.”You write about moments that “come from nowhere” in which life is “reframed.” What were your own moments?In 1982, I had to make a decision to tear my whole apparatus down and start my writing life again. The first books I’d written were OK but I had to devise a way of getting more of what I knew into what I was writing. I knew I wasn’t smart enough – although I was dogged enough – to be a great writer unless I could bring everything I had to the page every single day. I devised draconian clerical procedures. I immersed myself in raw material. I slowed everything down. It worked out better.Are you more comfortable with short stories? Is the commitment of a novel too much of a good – or long – thing?No – I’m writing a novel at the moment. Short stories are easier because they are shorter but are acutely demanding. Pulling together a collection of fundamentally disparate stories which you’d also like to be cohesive is more trying than writing a novel.You’ve lived in many places in the US. Is restlessness a novelist’s prerogative? And why did you swap New Orleans for Maine?I grew up in Jackson, Mississippi – the backside of the moon – and wanted to get away and see America. Fortunately, Kristina was an air-force child and had lived all over the US so was up for it. I moved to Maine because of my wife’s job which drove me crazy. She was director of city planning in New Orleans. I just told her, I know this is the job of your lifetime and I know you really want to keep it but I have to get out. So first, I went to Paris and then I came back and went to Maine. I had never been to Maine before.You’ve written about real estate with such panache… how would you describe your house in Maine if you were trying to sell it to me?Refurbished Cape Cod, 75 yards from the ocean. Six outbuildings, a guesthouse, four acres – a mini estate. I’d add: “Why you’re not already living in it is a mystery.” When I walked into this house, after six months of looking, I picked up the phone, called my wife and said: “Get up here right now. This house won’t be on the market tomorrow.” I showed her the house and she loved it. I said: “Please come up here and live with me.” And after four years, she did.Does getting older bring freedom?It brings the freedom of having seen a lot of things and survived them. Particularly other people’s failure to understand. It confers veteranship on you it makes things a bit easier. I’m transgressive by nature but feel bad when I transgress. A guy at the supermarket yesterday got very close to me without wearing a mask. I turned to him and said: “Don’t you like me? Are you trying to kill me? Get the hell away.” Then I felt bad. I don’t exercise my freedoms with alacrity.How often do you think about death and in what spirit?The novel I’m writing is about death and dying and is a comedy. Frank Bascombe is dying of a fatal disease… It’s called Be Mine. I’ll tell you one thing I’ve thought about death. It’s simple-minded in a way. But at 76, I’ve seen a lot of my friends “transition” and am shocked by how little gets left behind. Leaving aside the question of legacy, there will be some residue in the hearts and minds of others that lingers but I find there is so much less than I’d have liked.Why the fascination with Irishness in your book?My father’s family was Irish. I’m American. I’m not pretending to be an Irishman. But I taught at Trinity College Dublin and it was wonderful. I travelled round, picked up bits of stuff to put in my notebook. At some point, I thought I could use these to make a suite of stories. But I wasn’t trying to get to the heart of Ireland. The stories, if they’re any good, could equally have been set in Latvia.Are most people disappointed with their lives?Disappointments come to everybody willy-nilly. The making of ourselves is how we go beyond it.What do you read for sheer pleasure?I’m such a slow reader, I read to learn. I was raised a Presbyterian: you have to decide the hard things are the fun things. I started War and Peace during lockdown because it is one of those monolithic books you dare not undertake for the disappointment it would bring were you not to finish it. It is completely enrapturing…Is there any author or book you always return to?The Moviegoer by Walker Percy, Something Happened by Joseph Heller, A Fan’s Notes by Frederick Exley. And Elizabeth Bowen’s The House in Paris.What sort of reader were you as a child?Dyslexic. I am less dyslexic now because, in this perverse way, I’ve developed a writing and reading life.

That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last 20 years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don’t even know about each other.When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can’t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups.On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group’s leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: 1) Have fun. 2) Survive. 3) Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges – to pinch, to kick, to bite. By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. “I should have thought,” the officer says, “that a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” At this, Ralph bursts into tears. “Ralph wept for the end of innocence,” we read, and for “the darkness of man’s heart”.This story never happened. An English schoolmaster, William Golding, made up this story in 1951 – his novel Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than 30 languages and hailed as one of the classics of the 20th century. In hindsight, the secret to the book’s success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the 1960s on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us?I first read Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding’s view of human nature. That didn’t happen until years later when I began delving into the author’s life. I learned what an unhappy inidual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression a man who beat his kids. “I have always understood the Nazis,” Golding confessed, “because I am of that sort by nature.” And it was “partly out of that sad self-knowledge” that he wrote Lord of the Flies.I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life Lord of the Flies. After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: “One day, in 1977, six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.”The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to 1977 turned out to have been a typo. In the 6 October 1966 edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: “Sunday showing for Tongan castaways”. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of ‘Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys’ adventure.I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain’s name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: “Mates share 50-year bond”. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: “Deep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is 83 years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, 67, was, literally, a child of nature.” Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island.My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys 50 years ago, Captain Peter Warner.Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the 1930s, Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country’s radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father’s footsteps. Instead, at the age of 17, he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain’s certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. “What’s easiest?” Peter asked. “Accountancy,” Arthur lied.Peter went to work for his father’s company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of 1966. On the way home he took a little detour and that’s when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, ‘Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, ‘Ata had been deserted – cursed and forgotten.But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. “In the tropics it’s unusual for fires to start spontaneously,” he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. “My name is Stephen,” he cried in perfect English. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here 15 months.”The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku‘alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku‘alofa. “I’ve got six kids here,” he told the operator. “Stand by,” came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: “You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on ‘Ata. Peter’s memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of 90, everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, 15 years old at the time and now pushing 70, who lived just a few hours’ drive from him. The real Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965. The protagonists were six boys – Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano – all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku‘alofa. The oldest was 16, the youngest 13, and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some 500 miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand. There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to “borrow” one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn’t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass.No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. “We drifted for eight days,” Mano told me. “Without food. Without water.” The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening. Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, ‘Ata is considered uninhabitable. But “by the time we arrived,” Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, “the boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.” While the boys in Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year.The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat – an instrument Peter has kept all these years – and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf. Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. “Don’t worry,” Sione joked. “We’ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa‘ahau Tupou himself!”They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat) seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the 100 years since the last Tongans had left). They were finally rescued on Sunday 11 September 1966. The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen’s perfectly healed leg. But this wasn’t the end of the boys’ little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku‘alofa police boarded Peter’s boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had “borrowed” 15 months earlier, was still furious, and he’d decided to press charges.Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father’s corporate accountant, Peter managed the company’s film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel 7 in Sydney. “You can have the Australian rights,” he told them. “Give me the world rights.” Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila £150 for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel 7 arrived. The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Haʻafeva – population 900 – had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. “Thank you for rescuing six of my subjects,” His Royal Highness said. “Now, is there anything I can do for you?” The captain didn’t have to think long. “Yes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.” The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father’s company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat. While the boys of ‘Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding’s book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. “I read and reread Lord of the Flies ,” ulged the creator of hit series Survivor in an interview.It’s time we told a different kind of story. The real Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter’s picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands. His memoirs, he explained, written for his children and grandchildren. I looked down at the first page. “Life has taught me a great deal,” it began, “including the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.”• This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore.

But many of those attempting to buy a home in London might interpret that same image as – how shall we put this? – slightly less heroic.As Foxtons operates in London, which has largely been a sellers’ market for decades, these differing views of its frontline workers may be the inevitable function of supply and demand.Yet the perception that the company employs punchy dealmakers is also perhaps one of the firm’s main selling points to customers (people who have houses to sell or let). It is also possibly why the company modelled its image on a cocky young gang on the make, deploying a fleet of branded Minis to zip around the capital in an unashamed hat tip to the 1969 heist film The Italian Job.Now, a bit like the film’s fictional heroes escaping Turin, this team of brash youthful Londoners must navigate their way through the seemingly impassable gridlock of the Covid-19 economy – a theme that will be much in evidence this week as Foxtons holds its AGM.The 2020 gathering will, of course, differ from the norm – and not just because it will have to be conducted remotely. Astonishingly, the AGM looks unlikely to host the usual scrap over executive pay, which just goes to show how the coronavirus pandemic has blown the doors off old certainties.Still, while the general market is clearly in turmoil and Foxtons looks sure to be hit, it is still a large and relatively well-funded player in what remains a very fragmented market. Smaller chains of estate agents seem to be facing even more challenges, and many large rivals still need to devise escape routes.Foxtons’ shares are, in effect, always a punt on the London housing market – which has been off-colour ever since the Brexit vote – and so holding them (even at these low levels) is an act of faith. But there will come a time when another sharp-suited salesperson, this time in the City, will sniff a commission and attempt to persuade investors that the firm is not about to fall off a cliff. “Hang on a minute, lads,” he will inevitably say. “I’ve got a great idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fedb00932f6e9dcb3bf6db9d01f1a6e23592f80e/294_87_5005_3002/master/5005.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1f66d3ab33a021b309b262010082aa7","title":"close your eyes and imagine seeing the art worlds treasures as if for the first time","story":"The museums of Europe have begun reopening their doors to art lovers desperate to see old favourites and new worksI am cursing my bad luck not to be stuck in lockdown in the Prado. A friend wishes she had stowed away in a closet before they bolted the doors of the National Gallery. Others would give anything for a week in the Rijksmuseum, a day in the Uffizi, an hour with Rembrandt or Vermeer, even just a few minutes with a Samuel Palmer moonscape in the Ashmolean or a Turner sunrise at Tate Britain. Museums are places of the heart.We see art in time and place we cannot see it otherwise. Of course there are other whereabouts of the works we most long to set eyes on again, during this evil pandemic: the cave paintings at Chaumet in France, Fra Angelico’s Annunciation in a Florentine monastery, Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty coiled in the glistening waters of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. These were all chosen in an unofficial and entirely self-selecting Twitter survey (mine), along with Leonardo’s The Last Supper and James Turrell’s Deer Shelter Skyspace, framing the blue heavens above Yorkshire Sculpture Park.But almost every other beloved artwork lived in a museum and some people simply wanted to be in a museum itself, wandering the rooms, chancing upon unexpected or unknown visions, making the pilgrimage to visit a cherished old friend.This became possible once again in Germany this month. The Barberini Museum in Berlin’s Potsdam reopened on Wednesday with a Monet exhibition. Visitors have to book in advance for a timed slot in front of the haystacks and waterlilies, wearing a mandatory mask. At the Brandenburg State Museum for Modern Art, in Cottbus, 60 miles from Berlin, everyone is required to keep 1.5 metres apart, the exact measurement being indicated on the walls and floors. At the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, however, they merely ask you to cover mouth and nose.The Kunsthalle in Zurich reopens on Tuesday, followed on 19 May by MHKA, the museum of modern art in Antwerp. Its director, Bart De Baere, has compared museums with parks: “Spaces in which the inidual experience can intertwine with the public space of being together.” Perhaps safe distancing in Belgian parks is more self-disciplined than here. One can only hope so, given De Baere’s unfortunate declaration that MKHA is “ready to serve as a test room for the post-lockdown experience”.How are art museums to reopen without endangering staff and visitors? Cimam, the international committee for museums and collections, has already laid out some unarguably rational rules. Timed entry, limited viewing slots, one-way systems. Online booking, plexiglass barriers, face masks and hand gel. No paper, no maps, no headphones obviously no group tours.How ideal, you might think: gone are the guides laboriously instructing their victims in the “facts” of a painting, the poor crosslegged kids required to count all the dogs in a room, the visitors struggling for a glimpse of the masterpiece at the back of a pressing scrum. But numbers must be restricted, and movement solo. Alone together… like a Zoom conference.Clear enough, except when geopolitics enters the picture. In China, where museums reopened last month, the requisite social distance is 1.5 metre, as in Germany, but in Britain it will surely be 2 metres. Apparently, the viral plume of a sneeze measures differently across the continents. On the other hand, there are temperature tests at the door of Chinese museums, and ID plus quarantine data are required. Whereas in Britain we have T-shirt masks, disputed apps and the tragic augury of the Turkish gowns consignment.Soothsayers predict that the golden age of the blockbuster exhibition is over. Masterworks will no longer be flown like postcards across the globe freight will be dangerous insurance impossible. Who is to say whether America will swap art with China, or vice versa, and there is no money, besides. A brilliant but depressing online conference hosted by the Art Newspaper last weekend explored the possibilities of exacting 3D reproduction: an almost Starry Night for every museum.Nobody knows when we will walk through our galleries again. From my window, I can see the bus that took me to Tate Britain, the National Gallery, the Courtauld and the bridge across the Thames to Tate Modern. But there’s no distancing at the stop and nobody wears a mask. A driver on that route died last month from the virus.It is not easy to see how our mighty institutions can reopen without physical danger entering. But at least visitors have a choice, unlike the guards, cleaners, receptionists, caterers and others who may be daily exposed. How imponderable the risk is apparent in Germany, where galleries are taking the precaution of propping their doors open – just in case people touch them.If B\u0026ampQ can open, argued a friend, then why not Tate Britain? Museums are not shops we don’t touch the goods. Art lovers are cautious and sensible. Perhaps, but who would risk someone else’s health just because they couldn’t wait another week to see a Rembrandt? The lucky truth is that the government slyly avoided telling our museums when to shut, and the decision to reopen will lie with conscientious directors and trustees. But when that moment comes, it will mark the end of a kind of blindness. The exhilaration of seeing art once more will be unprecedented in our lifetimes.• Laura Cumming is the Observer’s art critic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/affd9f4c1b751bf84c6d5780f62fbf0e9e1369b2/0_274_4134_2479/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=388baede0fb8a340d5823c861ba6b2aa","title":"europe day message solidarity friendship british people","story":"The UK may no longer be an EU member but, as the current health crisis shows, cooperation continues to be essentialOn Saturday, for the first time in almost 50 years, we observe Europe Day without the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Union. As ambassadors and high commissioners representing the EU and its 27 countries in the UK, we are nonetheless very keen to mark the date with all the citizens of this great country and with the millions of EU nationals who live and work in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.We celebrate Europe on 9 May because on this same day in 1950, exactly 70 years ago, in the aftermath of the devastating second world war, Robert Schuman, the Luxembourg-born foreign minister of France, laid the foundations of our collective endeavour. He said then: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.”Since then, Schuman’s dream has come gradually to fruition, enabling many countries and millions of Europeans to enjoy freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and high standards of living, in what historians will register as the longest period of peace in our part of the world for many centuries.After progressively enlarging its scope, both politically and geographically, the EU became the biggest single market and the most important provider of development and humanitarian aid in the world, a true global actor committed to effective multilateralism. With almost half a billion citizens, it brings together peoples and nations from all over Europe who are proud of their history and culture but know they will be stronger together. It is telling that this year, we also mark the 25th anniversary of the accession to the union of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and the 40th anniversary of the historic Solidarity movement in Poland.All this and much more is what we are proudly celebrating today. We do so while looking forward, with confidence, to the future of our union, focused on finding a common way out of the health emergency, ensuring an inclusive economic recovery and building the foundations for sustainable development in Europe and around the world.The United Kingdom made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the European Union. It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country.The current unprecedented health emergency has brought us closer together – within each of our countries and among the 27, as well as between all of us in the EU and our British friends. We all know that Covid-19 spares no one – no family, no country. We all know that only together will we be able to overcome it.In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic.An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely. British flights did the same for EU citizens. These examples illustrate how the most challenging situations bring to the fore the best in each of us, as the Queen so eloquently highlighted in her broadcast to the nation on 5 April.A democratic decision, which we regret but fully respect, was made by the United Kingdom to leave the EU. We are now implementing the transitional provisions of the withdrawal agreement while negotiating the terms of our future relations. For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought.Indeed, in today’s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states – and peoples – is essential. A good example is what the UK and Italy are doing together on the climate crisis, in jointly ensuring that the Cop26 conference delivers a high level of global ambition to overcome this major challenge for mankind. Another is the ongoing global pledge to finance treatment and vaccination against Covid-19, of which the EU and the UK are major sponsors.We believe that cooperation and solidarity among countries, with full respect for sovereignty and ersity, are key factors in overcoming today’s challenges, starting with the present health emergency. We trust that these principles will also inspire the future relationship between the UK and the EU – and that is the friendly message that, as a united group of 28 ambassadors and high commissioners, we would like to convey to the British people on this Europe Day.This article was jointly authored by: João Vale de Almeida, ambassador of the European Union to the United Kingdom Michael Zimmermann, ambassador of Austria Ellen De Geest, chargé d’affaires of Belgium Marin Raykov, ambassador of Bulgaria Igor Pokaz, ambassador of Croatia Andreas S Kakouris, high commissioner of Cyprus Libor Sečka, ambassador of the Czech Republic Lars Thuesen, ambassador of Denmark Tiina Intelmann, ambassador of Estonia Markku Keinänen, ambassador of Finland Catherine Colonna, ambassador of France Julia Gross, chargé d’affaires of Germany Dimitris Caramitsos-Tziras, ambassador of Greece Ferenc Kumin, ambassador of Hungary Adrian O’Neill, ambassador of Ireland Raffaele Trombetta, ambassador of Italy Katarina Plātere, chargé d’affaires of Latvia Renatas Norkus, ambassador of Lithuania Jean Olinger, ambassador of Luxembourg Joseph Cole, high commissioner of Malta Simon Smits, ambassador of the Netherlands Arkady Rzegocki, ambassador of Poland Manuel Lobo Antunes, ambassador of Portugal Sorin-Dan Mihalache, ambassador of Romania Lubomír Rehák, ambassador of Slovakia Tadej Rupel, ambassador of Slovenia Carlos Bastarreche, ambassador of Spain Torbjörn Sohlström, ambassador of Sweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea880376c5e20c9297527798f8c18b19b0faa45/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0e7d2bed7c003083fb8f917df5cbf3","title":"lockdown see natural world anew not waste","story":"The pandemic is giving us a lesson in life, hope and death. It’s one we should never forgetBack in the days when we all still hurried oblivious through crowded city streets, the names chalked on the pavement must have been easily missed. But now a long-running campaign by rebel botanists across Europe to highlight overlooked nature in the city, scribbling names and plant details alongside a pretty weed growing through a wall or a tree spreading overhead, has unexpectedly found its niche.Going for a walk is the only real freedom many have had for weeks, and with no particular place to go but out, there is finally time to notice nature creeping through the cracks: the birdsong no longer drowned out by traffic the daffodils in front gardens giving way to frothy peonies a fat supermoon hanging heavy on the night horizon.Our relationship with the natural world is changing as this crisis strips away the layers between humans and the surroundings we used to be too busy to take in. The outdoors, once something glimpsed from a train window, has become somewhere to relieve the anxiety and sometimes let out the grief.Out here in the countryside, lockdown has been perhaps a gentler experience than in the cities. But still the tangible signs of spring unfurling into lush, green summer have been one of the few things giving shape to these nebulous, anxious weeks. When everything else feels jangling and wrong, the sight of meadows turning yellow with buttercups, or the sweet-sour tang of elderflowers blooming in the hedgerows, confirms that at least something is unfolding roughly as it should.I have stopped measuring time by useless empty calendars and started measuring it in the garden, where life goes on even when human clocks have stopped. The seeds planted in a fit of jittery displacement activity when lockdown started were green shoots by the time it was renewed, and are tall enough to go out in the vegetable patch now that the rules are on the verge of being renewed again. I suspect we’ll have eaten the tomatoes and courgettes long before it ends. Growing things makes me wonder who will bring a gardener’s mentality to this crisis, planting the seeds of ideas that will bear fruit in years to come.One of the few things to emerge with any clarity from muddled government messages about the next phase is that the outdoors will become much more important to us, because that’s where the first signs of normal life will return. Talk of being allowed to sunbathe in parks, have picnics or go rambling may sound Enid Blyton-esque but outside may be the best place for the anxious to be, and not just in a pandemic. Research repeatedly shows that being close to the wild makes people feel healthier and happier.This pandemic must surely lead to far greater scrutiny of the relationship between human health and the natural world, with scientists warning that deforestation and habitat destruction have driven wild animals into closer proximity with humans and helped novel viruses leap the species barrier. Such cavalier, short-sighted exploitation of our environment cannot carry on.But closer to home, it should also stop us taking small British family farmers for granted, or imposing brutal forms of Brexit that leave nothing but the most industrialised agribusinesses standing. Farmers and food producers aren’t classed as key workers for nothing when the supermarkets ran out of delivery slots for vulnerable people, in rural communities it was farm shops and vegetable-box schemes, flour mills and backyard chicken keepers who filled the gap.Developers eyeing up once unloved parks and urban green spaces, meanwhile, can forget it. When this is over people will want more, not less, of the lungs that help cities breathe: more tree planting in urban streets and more room for allotments. City living isn’t dead – no matter how many Londoners have wistfully Googled “moving to the country” over the last few weeks – but must make room for people to live a little closer to nature than they currently do.Right across the country, we should insist that new housebuilding schemes leave room for families to have proper gardens and grow food communally schools, too, need wild places for children to play, not just asphalt and sports fields. It’s not about preparing for another pandemic so much as learning the lessons this one is teaching us about emotionally resilient lives. Research published this week by the University of Exeter, showing people who can get into a garden are healthier and happier than those who can’t, was conducted before anyone had heard of Covid-19 but it makes even more sense now.Greens must still tread sensitively in response to this changing mood. Many people clearly take comfort from the idea that, with planes grounded and cars gathering dust, at least the planet can get a break from us. But if climate change campaigners are seen to be rejoicing too much in the accidental outcomes of a sad and terrifying time, they’ll lose sympathy. With thousands of airline workers losing their jobs, it will be a while before most people feel comfortable celebrating the decline of polluting industries.What environmentalists can do, even at the peak of a crisis forcing us all to live our lives in miniature, however, is to think local. Willingness to see the global picture often begins in inidual backyards. Campaigns to clear the oceans of plastic start with picking up rubbish on the beach. Encouraging wildflowers to grow on verges, as Rotherham council has been doing along an eight-mile stretch of road for years now, gets people thinking not only about the overuse of pesticides but about how to live with nature instead of constantly trying to overcome it.And taking up gardening can bring some comfort in times of loss, helping us to accept the passage of time and begin to come to terms with the cycle of life, death and hope.A garden is a reminder that there will always be a next summer, and hopefully a better one than this but it’s also a way of leaving something behind, for those who may not have another summer in them. When the journalist Deborah Orr was dying she ordered hundreds of tulip bulbs, tweeting that she would have made a piece of spring even if she wasn’t around to see it. Life as we used to know it will not return for everyone. But we have time to plant something green and new in its place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c6f799c765ceeb5c0023d6bcd258e5f0ff6221a/0_243_1022_613/master/1022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ec0f82142eae5141c6378a6a8c7bf3a","title":"pass judgment on adeles talent not on how much she weighs","story":"It’s depressing that the singer’s new skinny look matters more to some than her extraordinary voice It seems that Adele’s weight is fast becoming a feminist issue, although not in the way people usually mean. Last year, images of the singer’s extreme weight loss rocked the world. When she released a photo to mark her 32nd birthday last week, the internet exploded all over again. Some people thought her new look was great others considered it a (whisper it) betrayal. Some accused her of having a gastric band others bitched that she would soon pile it all back on again. “She looks good.” “She looks bad.” “She looks weird.” And on it goes.Adele isn’t new to this: her weight was also discussed (admiringly, critically, endlessly) before she lost it. In the modern musical landscape, where female artists specifically are viciously pressured to be perma-slim, the message seemed to be that she was one of those rare talents who were “allowed” to be bigger. At other times, the focus on her weight verged on patronising and reductive, as though her BMI-based “relatability” was the main draw and her talent a poor second.Is this why she decided to lose weight (she felt trapped in an outdated, stifling persona), or was it for health, love, personal reinvention? “Come on, Adele,” the world seems to be saying. “Never mind your stellar achievements. Stand in a pair of outsized leggings stretching them out to demonstrate how wonderfully skinny you got. Tell us your weight loss story.”For some, weight truly is the torture that never ends. On Planet Woman, even today, weight loss is still mainly cast as the life-giving sun, while weight gain is the foreboding death star that will kill your dreams. For some, it gets properly serious. The plus-size people who are made to feel grotesque on a daily basis. The anorexics whose deadly mental health condition is undermined and underfunded. The questions – the rage – around weight, diets and body image never stop. Why is a thin woman preferable to a fat one? Why is smaller better than bigger? Then you get Adele, a celebrity who decided to lose a shedload of weight, and there’s another pressing feminist question: whose business is it really?It’s depressing that one of the most celebrated singers of her generation has been reduced so easily and vehemently to a fatthin binary. It’s not that there’s been a reaction to Adele’s weight loss rather, that she has come to embody every possible over-reaction. There’s nothing wrong with a bit of a gossip but, casting around, neutrality to her new body is tellingly scarce. Instead, it’s Adele is a “thinspiration”. No, Adele is too thin! She’s let down other women! She’s cheated with surgery! She’ll be fat again soon! Some of these people won’t even realise why her size matters so much to them, just that it really does. Somehow, just by deciding to lose weight, Adele has been forced to take on the burden of all the fatphobia in the world.Oh no, the mother-in-law of the disgraced government scientific adviser, Neil Ferguson, clearly didn’t get the media memo. When asked to comment, Eileen Pirie was supposed to slate Ferguson for having his “married girlfriend” over. Instead, Pirie defended him, calling the attacks disgraceful. “I just cannot understand how someone who has done so much for this country can be vilified in this way.”Ms Pirie, have you lived here long? Otherwise, although there’s much to love about your spirited and civilised response, it’s complicated regarding Ferguson.Obviously Ferguson, who has resigned, shouldn’t have flouted his own lockdown advice. Sure, some of the attacks seem politically motivated, not to mention salacious. However, Ferguson has a nerve: telling everyone to stay home to save lives, and then having his girlfriend over to save his own sanity. This was exceptionalism as its raciest.Still, no wonder some scientists might prefer to remain anonymous. It’s one thing signing up to steer the nation through a pandemic, quite another ending up as tabloid fodder. There’s also the downer of Dominic Cummings and his chums showing up, like it’s open day at epidemiology camp. Not to mention complaints from Sage sub-committee, SPI-B, about an official a report where criticism of the government was redacted. If this carries on, seats on scientific committees will have to start featuring leather straps and leg irons to keep the scientists there.It’s not entirely unamusing to ponder the concept of data love gods (“Is that your statistical model, or are you just pleased to see me?”). However, as lockdown ersions go, this story has served its purpose, and perhaps we need to refocus our attention on what scientists are actually saying.Children may not be a high-risk group for coronavirus, but England’s most vulnerable children appear to be increasingly unprotected in other important ways.Children’s charities are complaining, and one, Article 39, is threatening legal action because the government appears to be using the crisis to remove vital safeguards for children in care. More than 60 protections have been removed or diluted covering crucial areas: reviews, scrutiny, notification of criminal convictions, and more.Some people may think “that’s a shame but this is an emergency”. However, removal of protections has been attempted before (and stopped by the Lords). The government acted without public consultation or parliamentary debate. Organisations that the government says it consulted deny that this happened. Only England is removing the safeguards, not Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Many withdrawn protections are not even coronavirus related. While changes are supposed to be temporary, there is no legal commitment to reinstate them.Coronavirus has turned the country – the world – upside down. Everyone understands that. However, it’s completely unacceptable not to have an official government commitment to reinstate protections post-lockdown. The children’s minister, Vicky Ford, has failed to respond to parliamentary questions, but she should start doing so. More than 78,000 children are in care in England. It’s our duty to look out for them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15727b4fe215a63dc85f048b5b7b0e0e6e944a28/108_60_3280_1968/master/3280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac2510302be5ffa6bf915d04c1517c8c","title":"workers health and safety is key letters","story":"As the country debates how and when to get the economy up and running, it would be wrong to pretend that Britain can return to business as usual. As even the prime minister admitted, we will need to proceed with “maximum caution”. That’s why we are calling on government to guarantee that the right policies and practices are in place to make workplaces safe. This must be a central part of any return.A crucial first step is to ensure all employers carry out thorough assessments of risks and identify the actions they are taking to deal with them. We want those risk assessments published. This is vital for giving workers confidence that it is safe to return to work. But it’s also a matter of national interest. One bad employer who plays fast and loose with safety not only puts those workers and their families in danger – they put public transport workers and whole communities at risk of infection too. What happens behind workplace doors must be consistent with the wider public health approach. If work cannot be done safely, it should not proceed.We cannot afford to cut any corners. The last few weeks have laid bare the terrible damage this virus can wreak.Our national death toll is now the highest in Europe. Many of our members have lost their lives transporting people and goods, protecting the public and caring for the vulnerable. Health and safety used to be mocked by the free marketeers and the role of union health and safety representatives undervalued. Now it and they must be an integral part of the fight against this pandemic.We know that most employers want to do the right thing. But for those who don’t, and whose actions risk the health of their workforce and our economic recovery, there must be no hiding place.After years of cuts, the government must boost funding for pro-active monitoring and health and safety enforcement. And we need a public information campaign so rogue bosses face sanctions. The trade union movement wants to be able to recommend the government’s back-to-work plans. But for us to do that we need to ensure that ministers have listened and that we stay safe and save lives at work too. Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, Len McCluskey, Unite general secretary, John Phillips, GMB acting general secretary, Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretaryI agree with Uisdean Robertson, the councillor for North Uist, and the Rev Drew Kuzma in arguing against ending the lockdown early in the Outer Hebrides (“Islanders bristle at idea of being used as ‘guinea pigs’ for ending lockdown”, News). The population has a predominance of over-60s and medical practitioners in the Western Isles are worried about the virus taking hold.Professor Hugh Pennington of Aberdeen University said a fortnight ago that “hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die”. It is not right that someone of Pennington’s eminence should advocate the easing of lockdown restrictions in the Islands and Highlands ahead of such measures elsewhere, while dismissing the gravity of likely hotspots. Nobody needs to “sadly die” in the interests of Pennington’s or Michael Gove’s suggested experiment. Perhaps, in the unwelcome event that the experiment is implemented, Gove and Pennington would care to relocate to the Outer Hebrides.Hamon MasseyIsle of South UistIn response to your editorial (“Care home death toll is an indictment of our society”), I think it is time to show respect to our elders and set them free first. They have been in lockdown the longest, they have been cut off from their friends and their shopping outings. They have been allowed to die in care homes, forced to self-isolate in single rooms and not allowed access to gardens this beautiful spring, or to receive visits from the ones they love. Let them trial the new measures needed in the Waitrose coffee shop. Let them drive in the empty streets. Let them smell the flowers in the parks. Let them be the first to play golf. Let them be happy at the end of their lives. Don’t punish them with more time in isolation. How many more care home deaths do you want? How much more mental health breakdown?Vanessa RaisonTheberton, LeistonSuffolk Ed Miliband was entirely right to suggest certain conditions must be imposed on companies that are bailed out with public money (“Public and private sectors must pull together to recover from this crisis”, News commentary). We want companies to survive, but if they use tax havens to hide profits, or don’t have a business plan in line with the Paris climate agreement, they need persuading to be better corporate citizens. Denmark, France and Poland are barring state support to firms based in tax havens but their conditions are weak, premised on the EU’s very limited blacklist of 12 countries.If they want public cash, transnational corporations should undertake public country-by-country reporting, so we know what profit is made, what tax paid, and where. They should report likewise on progress related to Paris 2015. We do not want to return to “normal” we need a “transformed normal”.Revd David Haslam, chair, Church Action for Tax JusticeEvesham, WorcsBarbara Ellen’s piece on home-schooling during lockdown makes some important points about disadvantaged children suffering most from school closures (“Home-schooling is tough, but parents are doing a fraction of teachers’ jobs”, Comment). However, dabbling in a bit of home-schooling doesn’t make mums and dads more akin to “parents-cum-teaching assistants” any more than writing this letter makes me akin to a reader-cum-journalist.School support staff are the most highly skilled, widely trained, incredibly dedicated, hardworking, underpaid, under-recognised, compassionate and decent group of workers I’ve ever had the privilege of being a member of. Please don’t play into the government narrative that we are a luxury and thus expendable when things get a bit tough – as they are just about to.Roger AldousBrightonYou say that Isolation Stories (Television highlights, New Review) was the first drama to be made during lockdown. However, S4C showed the excellent Cyswllt (Connection) on 29 April, six days earlier. It shows the effects of the lockdown on three different families and was made by the same team that produced Keeping Faith.Amanda EppsCharlbury, OxonIt is, as you say, long overdue that the UK government put its relationship with Saudi Arabia on a healthier footing (“Now is the time to distance ourselves from an odious regime”, Editorial). For years, the UK has claimed its behind-closed-doors diplomacy with Riyadh has been better than “lecturing” the kingdom over its appalling human rights record. Yet repression has only worsened, including under the supposed “reformer” Mohammed bin Salman. Now, virtually every human rights activist in the country has either been locked up, intimidated into silence or forced to flee the country.We may have sold Riyadh plenty of weaponry, but the UK’s hushed policy on Saudi human rights has sold the country’s embattled human rights community shamefully short.Kate Allen, directorAmnesty International UKLondon EC2Ged Meheran wants us to cheer the cuckoo (Letters).

Who says that getting older signals an end to vitality?You can’t call Judi Dench lazy when it comes to contributing to society, but she’s been particularly dedicated to boosting morale of late. Who knows, perhaps she felt pressured to make up for her turn in the unhinged Cats film, where her feline character horrified viewers by appearing to wear a coat made of its own fur. Dench has provided vital comic relief during this time of crisis, predominantly with silly social media clips – a Twitter video of her wearing a novelty dog hat with pop-up ears in which she instructs us to “keep laughing” racked up 5.4 million views. Now she has supplied a far meatier pick-me-up by becoming, at 85, British Vogue’s oldest cover star.On the front page of the magazine’s June issue, the Oscar-winner rocks a floral Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana coat. But her outfit is far from the most striking thing about the shot. Instead, what immediately hits you are her jaunty pixie haircut and sparkling blue eyes. And yes, her wrinkled skin doesn’t go unnoticed, either – unsurprisingly, given that fashion magazines, like the rest of society, aren’t exactly known for celebrating getting older.There are several heartening messages to take from the cover. First off, could it be that the age-phobic fashion world has finally realised that women don’t morph into unsightly crones the moment they hit 40? (And that readers won’t desert magazines when they choose to showcase them…) Admittedly, Dench is far from an everywoman. Her megawatt star power means she can, to an extent, escape the prejudices usually directed at older people. But seeing as publisher Condé Nast says the average Vogue reader is 39 for print and 44 for online, there’s a chance that this issue will enable readers to feel more represented age-wise. In turn, this could encourage the magazine to feature more older stars in the future.But the cover is also cheering for a bazillion more reasons. At 85, Dench is in one of the highest risk groups for Covid-19 as her issue hits the newsstands, talk continues of an extended lockdown for the over-70s. In other words, we’re all too aware of the potential physical consequences of getting older at present. In this context, shots of her grinning mischievously feel defiant. A bit like Captain Tom Moore, except in silk. It’s for this same reason that her lighthearted social media videos have been such big hits. (Along with the dog hat offering, Dench did a TikTok dance with her grandson and went viral after teaming up with Gyles Brandreth for a rendition of The Owl and the Pussy-cat.)Moreover, while the interview likens Dench to a “cultural tea cosy”, the conversation shows she’s much sharper than that. Take her pleasingly blunt response to her outfit in Cats. She describes her cloak as: “Like five foxes fucking on my back.” Society has a tendency to patronise older people by pretending they are universally benign. Aside from giving a glimpse into how she operates on set, Dench’s confession that she can “be very difficult if somebody takes me for granted” hints that, well… don’t try that attitude with her.Besides, while we continue to fetishise youth – just think of the tributes to how the BBC’s Normal People depicts the intensity of being young - a “pin sharp” depiction, went a recent  editorial, of “the unforgettable intensity of first love and lust – Dench reminds us that there’s plenty of inspiration and vivacity to be found among the senior generation, too. The psychotherapist Esther Perel recently spoke in a Financial Times podcast about how grandparents discussing difficult periods in their lives with younger relatives may be a way of passing resilience down the generations. I was reminded of this while watching the video that runs with Dench’s interview online, in which younger stars grill her for professional advice. Yes, she’s largely discussing acting rather than anything darker, but it still confirms that with age comes wisdom.Age is not just a number Dench is blunt about the physical challenges it brings. “It’s terrible to be so dependent on people,” she says of having to give up driving. Even so, she’s fiercely resistant to the expectations that come with getting older. Take her attitude to retirement, for instance: “Rage, rage against the dying of the light,” is how she sums it up, quoting Dylan Thomas. All in all, you’re left thinking that while you can’t fight ageing’s physical reality, it is possible to push back against the prejudice that accompanies it.Indeed, Dench’s cover will inevitably be branded age-defying, but it’s more accurate to say it defies our expectations of what getting older involves. Both her Vogue and social media stardom prove that vitality exists far beyond youth, and that it’s frankly ludicrous that society sidelines older women, given their style, wit and energy. Honestly, Dench has been so busy imparting all sorts of key lessons of late, I’d suggest she give herself a break and retire. But, of course, she’d never agree to that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8727cfd87043c2758c4141b426af0434f3c1f744/203_0_2794_1678/master/2794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03fb4f8d315c69936ef6874eb05797e5","title":"uk councils to enforce temporary road closures for safer school runs","story":"London and Manchester already have measures to restrict traffic, encourage walking and cycling, and cut air pollutionRoads are to be temporarily closed near schools when parents drop off and pick up their children, in order to deter people from driving on the school run – and to encourage more walking, cycling and scooting.The plans to shut off roads at school rush hours, using barriers, cones and other measures, are already far advanced in London and Manchester and are expected to be followed in other cities and towns.Will Norman, London’s walking and cycling commissioner, told the Observer: “It will mean timed restrictions on traffic around schools to allow people to safely walk to school, cycle to school, scoot to school. I don’t mind if they are on space hoppers as long as it’s not by car. You need to reduce the amount of traffic to allow pupils and parents to walk safely.”Norman said there would be an added danger to parents and children who would have to keep two metres apart if the roads were busy near schools. “The last thing we want is kids and their parents stepping into a busy road or to see increasing air quality problems around schools.Transport planners are worried that if more people opt to use their cars after the lockdown ends, to get children to and from school, there will be gridlock in urban areas. They also warn that there will be a rapid rise in pollution levels around schools that will be bad for pupils’ and teachers’ health.A national cycling plan will be published in early June to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025, he said. Measures will include pop-up bike lanes and wider pavements as well as cycle and bus-only streets. Trials of e-scooters will also be fast-tracked in a bid to get rental schemes up and running in cities as fast as possible.The length of time that temporary road closures around schools would last, and precisely how they work, will be left up to local councils. But both London mayor Sadiq Khan and the mayor of Greater Manchester, have made clear money will be available and emergency powers can be used to allow them to do so.They say the closures would also make it safer for people to walk or cycle at safe distances from each other en route to and from schools, and help buses carrying children avoid running into heavy congestion.Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling gold medallist, who is now cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, said the current crisis had created a unique opportunity to try out ideas that people might find they want to adopt permanently.Every year more than 200 million car journeys of less than 1km are made, many of these being on school runs.Graham Stapleton, the CEO of retail chain Halfords, said he supported calls by Boardman for trials on e-scooters.“We welcome reports of a forthcoming government announcement on fast tracking e-scooter trials and think if this is true, it will go some way to setting a legal and regulatory framework that means they can be lawfully used on our roads. There is overwhelming public support for trials.”Khan said: “To help mitigate the impact of a greatly reduced capacity on public transport, due to social distancing, we will need millions of journeys a day to be made by other means. If people switch only a fraction of these journeys to cars, London risks grinding to a halt, air quality will worsen, and road danger will increase.“Modelling has shown that there is potential for a tenfold increase in kilometres cycled and up to five times the amount of walking. Our Streetspace plan will act as a catalyst for this change, fast-tracking schemes that will enable many more people to take to two wheels or travel on foot. This includes repurposing traffic lanes on main roads for temporary cycle lanes, widening footways so that people can safely socially distance, looking at where we need to restrict roads to buses and bikes only at certain times of the day, and reducing traffic on residential streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f425cedbd8a55b9a509d8ee6523a95aaf54b80/0_113_4549_2730/master/4549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29f0d6e740e9dbc710143d67ccb563e6","title":"finding sanctuary in nature during lockdown","story":"Determined to find an uplifting moment every day, the Yorkshire photographer Rebecca Cole has been in search of images that bring spring to her family and friends in lockdown. She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past. This kestrel seemed to be owning the space here, but in the last few days the jackdaws have moved in and the kestrel has reluctantly moved two metres upstairs into another box. They live with physical distancing as the norm. It works. I’ll hold onto that thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ab4e08e66cb865ae769ac558e7e74a7de142dd/0_0_2400_3000/master/2400.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3847ce0faf050ba5afc6aeed248057 700w","title":"everton v liverpool 1986 fa cup final live","story":"So commiserations to Everton ... and congratulations to double-winners Liverpool! That was a wonderful final. Had Everton managed to find a second goal just after the break, when Liverpool collectively lost their heads - they looked gone - they’d have surely closed this game out. They’d been much the better side for most of the first hour. And that’s without bringing up the penalty shout. But Liverpool dug in, and when they finally found their rhythm, all bets were off. Two of their goals were astonishing pitch-length sweeps. Jan Molby was imperious, Ian Rush ice-cool and deadly. They imposed themselves on the final half hour to such an extent that 3-1 doesn’t flatter them in the slightest. You have to feel sorry for Everton, who came so close to the double themselves. But this Liverpool side are worthy winners of both league and cup, and can now be found in the record books alongside the famous teams of Preston North End, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. Not such a bad vintage after all, eh?But Kendall tries hard, really hard, to look on the bright side. “We haven’t finished the season with nothing. It’s a marvellous season we’ve had. We’ve finished second in the League and been to Wembley. Most clubs would settle for that. But it’s a shattering end to the season when you think of who won the Double.”A dejected Howard Kendall delivers his analysis: “We hadn’t really looked in any danger, we were dictating the game. But defensively you cannot do the things we did and get away with it, because a team like Liverpool will punish you.” As for the “blatant penalty” for Nicol’s first-half challenge on Sharp? “From where I was sitting Sharp had a free header and for him not to touch it there must have been an infringement. I believe my opinion will be proved right when I see it again, just as it was two years ago in the Milk Cup final when Hansen handled. It was the same referee, too. So we could have gone in at half-time 2-0 ahead. I know it’s going to sound like sour grapes, but incidents like that are turning points, and I can’t help but mention it.”Kenny Dalglish, still dazzling, talks! “The lads deserve every single thing that’s happened. I am as delighted for them as I am for myself. To do the Double in your first season as manager is an absolute dream, but it would be harder if you didn’t have such good people to work with and work for. The important thing is that a team like ours wasn’t going to go haywire. With somebody like Rushie up front, we always had a chance to score, and on the day we have turned out to be deserved winners. But Everton can’t have too much wrong with them if they finish second in the League and runners-up in the Cup. We have tremendous respect for each other. Both sets of fans are a credit to the clubs, and the same goes for both sets of players.”Alan Hansen goes up to lift the cup, a fan’s scarf tied jauntily around his neck. He joins Ron Yeats and Emlyn Hughes as a member of a very exclusive club: an FA Cup winning captain for Liverpool. Behind him, his boss and friend Kenny Dalglish beams like a schoolboy. He’s in an exclusive club too, an exclusive club of one: the first player-manager to win the FA Cup! Liverpool make it back down to the pitch and dance around for a bit. For all the league titles and European baubles, the FA Cup is a rare treat. Dalglish and Hansen, both getting on a bit, may have wondered if they’d ever get their hands on it.Perhaps we should put those aforementioned parallel universes to use, because that was a brilliant final, but a very strange one. In another world, Everton could quite feasibly have built a three-goal lead, in which case this game would have been a one-sided blowout. But Liverpool could quite as easily have run up five or six goals, such was their dominance towards the end. The small margins. Back in the real world, 3-1 seems about right.And that’s that! The double is Liverpool’s! Kenny Dalglish raises both arms in slightly exhausted glee. Not a bad first season in management, huh?90 min +2: A cacophony of whistles. But suddenly they all stop, as Wembley holds its breath in the anticipation of witnessing a little bit of history. Molby hooks down the middle and Rush powers clear! He’s one on one with Mimms, and should complete the first hat-trick in an FA Cup final since Blackpool legend Stanley Mortensen scored three in 1953 ... but his attempt to wedge casually over Mimms from 25 yards is weak and the keeper snaffles. In truth, it would have been cruel on Everton had they conceded a fourth.90 min +1: Heath races down the left and wins a corner off Lawrenson. Everton play it short, working it to Bracewell on the corner of the box. He floats a diagonal ball towards Mountfield at the far stick, but Grobbelaar plucks it off his head, in the one-handed basketball style. What showmanship! All that earlier fussin’ and a-fightin’ long forgotten.90 min: One last throw of the dice by Steven, who tears infield from the right and keeps on going, all the way across the face of the Liverpool box. But a pass doesn’t present itself, and there’s no opportunity to shoot. Suddenly Liverpool are breaking upfield on the counter! Dalglish flicks the ball to Rush, who makes good up the middle, with only Ratcliffe holding the fort. He’s got MacDonald in acres to his right, and in truth that’s the proper pass. But the heart rules the head, and he looks for Dalglish, overlapping on the left. What a waste, because Dalglish doesn’t go for the fairytale goal everyone in red wants to see, instead trying to feed a diagonal pass through to MacDonald. But MacDonald has checked his run, and the chance is gone. Not that it really matters, because the clock hits 90 and we enter stoppage time. There shouldn’t be much this wonderfully strange, effervescent game has flowed from the get-go like a bubbling mountain stream.89 min: All very scrappy now, and Liverpool care not a jot.88 min: Dalglish scampers down the right, and has his boot whipped off by Bracewell. Another opportunity to run down the clock, and it’s taken with pleasure. 87 min: Everton are going nowhere, so Liverpool’s supporters go early with their celebratory ditty: You’ll Never Walk Alone pings off the walls of the grand old place.86 min: Reid comes through the back of Nicol, Everton’s frustration palpable. They must be wondering how they’ve let this one slip. They looked a shoo-in 30 minutes ago. Now they’re very much second best, having been totally swept away by a red tide. “Amazing that Molby has been the dominant player in this second half given the state of the pitch,” writes Niall Mullen. “Looks like Live Aid was last week, not last year.”85 min: That was a sensational pitch-length team move. Whelan and Dalglish hug in delight, while Rush peels off to the fans, soon to be joined in his carefree cavort by Molby! Liverpool know they’re very close to the double now. That’s Rush’s 33rd goal of the season, and his second of the final. No assist for Molby this time - Whelan crafting the wonderful final pass - but he set the move alight by switching play in the centre circle, and he’s surely Liverpool’s man of the match.Sheedy scampers down the middle and tries to float a ball towards Lineker on the edge of the box, but Nicol wins the header. Liverpool play out calmly from the back, Whelan curling to Johnston on the right. Johnston heads down to Rush, who spins infield and finds Molby in the centre circle. Van den Hauwe comes racing in, but Molby turns and knocks the ball past him, into the wide open space the right-back had vacated. What vision! Whelan romps into acres down the inside left, past the naughty blue balloon, and checks infield. Dalglish makes a run across him and to the left, and wants the ball he’d be free in the box if Whelan plays the reverse pass. But Rush is sailing in from the right, and Whelan curls a perfect diagonal looper over Ratcliffe, the ball dropping gently at the feet of the striker. Rush takes a touch to sort his feet and batters an unstoppable shot across Mimms and into the bottom left, sending a camera flying. What a picture-book goal!83 min: Space for Steven down the right, with plenty of options at the far post. He sends a directionless cross out for a goal kick. Lineker has the distracted air of somebody still thinking about that last golden opportunity.82 min still: Rush ferrets down the right and pulls back for Molby, who curls long in the hope of finding Dalglish at the far post for a tap-in. The cross is too high, but Dalglish is still able to gather, turn and set up Whelan for a left-footed hoick that’s always curling wide right. 82 min: What a chance for Everton! Molby faffs about in midfield and is stripped by Heath. Suddenly Sharp is heading down the inside-left channel. Liverpool are super-light at the back, and Sharp flicks a pass down the middle for Lineker, sending him clear! But Lineker’s first touch lets him down, and that allows Beglin to confidently step across, snatch the ball off his toe, turn abruptly and stride off. What calm assurance from a man who looked so nervous less than half an hour ago!81 min: Dalglish lashes long, Everton having committed just about everyone forward in a futile attack. Molby finds himself in a footrace with last-man Mountfield. The defender’s always going to get to the ball first. Liverpool will be wishing Rush was the player haring after that.80 min: Johnston gives Dalglish a hospital pass in midfield and Reid takes over, chipping a fine first-time ball down the left channel to release Lineker. The striker’s clearly offside, and so the flag goes up and the whistle blows. Exactly why, with precious time running out, Lineker then decides to round Grobbelaar and ostentatiously roll into an empty net, to similarly hollow cheers, is unclear. But that’s what he does. Liverpool won’t mind at all, and Grobbelaar grabs the opportunity to take an age over the restart.79 min: Liverpool ping it about a bit, before losing possession. Reid looks to power upfield, but is stripped by Whelan, who chips Rush into space, the ball nearly bouncing off a rogue blue balloon. Rush pulls back for Dalglish, who rolls a pass across for Molby. The Danish international has clearly been taking notes off Michael Laudrup - or maybe Johan Cruyff at Ajax - because he suddenly sparks into life, sashaying through a small gap along the inside-left channel, past three blue shirts in a flash. Suddenly he’s one on one with Mimms! Just as it looks as though Ricky Villa’s mesmerising 1981 dribble will no longer be the aesthete’s cup-final goal of choice, Mimms somehow blocks. Such a shame, that would have been a glorious way to seal the deal, by the man whose two assists has brought Liverpool to the brink of glory.78 min: Rush embarks on a couple of sorties into enemy territory. First time he races after a bouncing ball down the right, but is crowded out by Ratcliffe and Van den Hauwe. The next time he’s clattered by Van den Hauwe, allowing Liverpool to take their sweet time over the restart. The clock ticks on. The double edges ever closer.77 min: Everton are awarded a free kick just to the right of the Liverpool D, Hansen penalised for climbing all over Heath. They take it quickly, and look to have utterly wasted it, going nowhere. But they retain possession, and eventually a game of head tennis breaks out in the Liverpool box. A poor Lawrenson clearance allows Mountfield to tee up Sharp, who tries to whistle a bicycle kick goalwards. It’s wild and high. Nowhere near.76 min: Sharp clumsily clips Lawrenson. There’s no malice in it, but it allows Lawrenson to stay down and eat up some time, game-management 101. Incidentally, if Everton are heading for double heartbreak, spare a thought also for Heart of Midlothian, who were eight minutes away from their first Scottish title since 1960 last weekend, before Dundee’s Albert Kidd cruelly dashed their hopes and let Celtic pip them at the death. They’ve just gone 3-0 down against Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden. Misery assured for Alex MacDonald’s men. Congratulations to Dons boss Alex Ferguson, who’ll take Scotland to Mexico next month, albeit controversially without a certain Alan Hansen.75 min: Sheedy, deep down the left, floats one in for Lineker. Hansen is forced to concede a corner with a spectacular ing header. Molby heads the resulting set piece clear. Everton are still finding some good positions, but the final ball is letting them down.74 min: Van den Hauwe swings one in deep from the right. Sheedy tries to diddle Johnston on the left but can’t get the better of the relentless Liverpool goalscorer, who has put in some shift at both ends of the field. The newly arrived Heath takes up possession and has his first whack, but Whelan blocks.72 min: Everton replace Gary Stevens with Adrian Heath, who came off the bench to score in the fifth round at Tottenham Hotspur, and sparked a two-goal comeback at Luton Town in the quarter-finals. More super-sub heroics coming up?71 min: Here’s something both sets of fans can agree on: a lusty rendition of “Are you watching, Manchester?” Ah, they’ll have their time again some day. What goes round always comes round. 70 min: Everton pin Liverpool back for the first time in a while. A long throw leads to a deflected Sheedy slapshot and a corner on the left. Steven takes, but Grobbelaar, a completely different man now, rises to claim with supreme confidence.69 min: Dalglish slaloms down the inside-right channel with regal grace, not so much evading a lunge from Van den Hauwe as ignoring it. He’s eventually crowded out by three blue shirts on the edge of the Everton box. The ball breaks to Molby, who yanks a speculative long-range shot miles to the right of goal. Some run by the 35-year-old Dalglish, though. It’s no coincidence that Liverpool’s revival this season began when the player-manager started naming himself in the team again.68 min: But Lawrenson loses control and immediately clatters into Reid, and that’s a free kick to Everton, 30 yards out. Reid springs up, a parcel of busy fury, and Lawrenson briefly considers engaging, but the referee steps in to nip the bout in the bud. Sheedy floats the free kick to the right-hand post, but it’s too long and Steven has no hope of getting on the end of it. Goal kick.67 min: This is better. Mountfield goes long down the right. Sharp gets on the end of the pass and drives towards the box, with Lineker to his left. For a second, Liverpool look exposed, but Lineker strays offside, causing Sharp to delay and allowing Lawrenson to stride off with the ball.66 min: Van den Hauwe sends one into the Liverpool box from the left. Lineker is the only man anywhere near the action, yet nowhere near the ball. Everton suddenly look diminished. Dispirited. But there’s plenty of time left yet. Chin up, chaps.65 min: A Mimms goal kick ends up at the feet of Sheedy out on the left. He wedges a pass into the centre in the hope of releasing Steven, who looks yards offside ... but isn’t. Liverpool’s defensive line having stopped, they’re happy to see Grobbelaar racing out of his box to skelp clear. Ah hold on, the flag belatedly goes up for offside. Even so. This hasn’t been a defensive masterclass from the champions. Everton will surely get chances to get back into this.64 min: The Everton bench look stunned. Howard Kendall and his assistant Colin Harvey both adopt the internationally recognised head-in-hand pose of great woe and despair. You can’t blame them. Everton had dominated for most of the match, and came so close to building a two-goal lead, only for this whole affair to be turned upside down in short order. The last wild and crazy ten minutes could so easily have unfolded in so many other ways. Thin lines. It’s lucky there are infinite multiple universes.Beglin sends a long pass down the left for Rush, who faces up to Mountfield before flicking inside for Molby, striding down the channel. Molby enters the box and takes a touch to put enough distance between himself and Stevens. He fires low and hard along the face of the six-yard box. Dalglish arrives late and can’t connect. But Johnston barrels in at the far post and can’t miss, slamming into the bottom corner before leaping into the sky and performing a cute little scissor kick! He’s got his goal after all ... and it comes exactly 70 seconds after Grobbelaar stopped Sharp restoring Everton’s lead!62 min: So having said all that, Liverpool suddenly slip back into their pre-equaliser state of high panic. And it’s their normally unflappable captain who’s at fault! Stevens launches long down the inside-right channel. Hansen is ahead of Lineker in a footrace and gets to the ball first ... only to hook a suicidal clearance across the face of the box, the ball arcing perfectly towards the head of Sharp! The Everton striker rises above Nicol and sends a looping header towards the top left. It’s surely going in ... but Grobbelaar backpedals furiously and, arching his back and extending to full stretch, fingertips spectacularly over the bar! The keeper ends up in the net, from zero to hero in the space of six minutes! Placing a cherry on top of an elaborately iced cake, he then plucks Steven’s corner from the sky, unperturbed by the crowd gathered with a view to making trouble at his near post.61 min: Liverpool are more adventurous now, their passing moves more ambitious in scope. A widescreen minute sees Dalglish Cruyff-turn his way out of trouble to release MacDonald into space, the former Leicester man nearly getting on the end of a long-distance one-two with Whelan out on the left. Then Molby sprays a glorious diagonal pass towards Nicol on the right another attempted one-two, this one from closer range with Johnston, doesn’t quite come off. What a difference a goal makes!60 min: That was Rush’s 32nd goal of the season in all competitions. Both star forwards have delivered on all the pre-match hype today. The paying punters are getting plenty of bang for their buck.59 min: Talk about scoring against the run of play. Doubly worrying for Everton is the fact that Liverpool have never lost a match in which Rush has scored. He’s found the net in 120 games Liverpool have won 101 of them and drawn 19. Records are, of course, there to be broken, so let’s see how this pans out. It couldn’t happen in a major final at Wembley, surely?58 min: Soon after the restart, Liverpool, their tails suddenly up, come at Everton again, Dalglish and Johnston rampaging with purpose down the right. But Johnston crosses to nobody in particular and Everton are able to clear their lines and their heads.Liverpool play out from the back. Lawrenson nearly loses possession but rides a couple of challenges before poking the ball to Beglin on the left. Beglin goes long, looking for Dalglish. Mountfield covers and passes to Stevens out on the Everton right. Stevens looks for Reid up the flank, but his pass is clanked straight at Whelan, who rolls inside for Molby. The big Dane draws three Everton shirts, then flicks the ball through them with outrageous ease, releasing Rush with a perfectly weighted dink down the channel. Rush takes one touch to round Mimms on the left, then another to smoothly roll home. Johnston, the cheeky get, follows the ball in and tries to toe-poke it over the line, but he doesn’t get there in time, it’s Rush’s goal. Despite all the farcical antics up the other end, the champions have drawn level!57 min: Whelan slices high into the air in the centre circle. Very strange. Van den Hauwe hits an instant pass down the inside-left channel for Lineker to chase. This time Hansen gets up a head of steam and manages to poke the ball back to his keeper just before Lineker can take control, enter the box, score number 41, and put this final beyond Liverpool. Magnificent last-ditch defence. And then ...56 min again: A speculative Johnston hoof down the left is guided back towards Mimms by Mountfield. The backpass reaches the keeper, but only just, and Rush was lurking. Liverpool’s defenders may be lost in a fog of panic and confusion, but you can bet your last bronze centime that Rush, always a study in clarity of thought, remains sharp of mind and on the scent.

Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

In it, users explore a carefree pastel environment, growing fruits and flowers, catching bugs or fish to sell, and making friends with other characters in an open-ended simulation.Players are not alone in the game – by searching friend codes, an Animal Crossing user can visit others in the virtual world, joining them in their home or garden.The ability to socialize has led some to use the game for more than its original function – building a personal island and paying off debts – but also as a platform to hang out with friends while we remain unable to do so in the real world.When shelter in place was declared in San Francisco, Denali Winter, a hairdresser and sex worker who is non-binary, said they immediately knew their jobs would be severely impacted.An avid video gamer, Winter turned to Animal Crossing for solace. But soon, they began to use it for work as well – as a venue to beat, subdue, and order around clients who want to engage with a dominatrix from a safe distance.Winter, who has worked as a dominatrix for more than seven years, is now forcing clients to water flowers, cross dress, and pay them bells – the currency in Animal Crossing. If the players disobey, Winter can put them in a cage – virtually.“Sex workers are always adapting, and this is just another layer of adaptation,” Winter said. “I need to connect with my clients somehow.”Sex workers have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Winter advertises services on Twitter, and shares their friend code with clients who want to come water their flowers or do other chores. The clients most often do not pay Winter real money to engage on the game, they said, but simply help virtually.Many of the activities Winter did in person as a dominatrix can be replicated within Animal Crossing, they said. They are able to smack fellow users with a net used to catch butterflies or mock them while they cry using different controls on the app, or build a cage for people when they are “bad”.As someone who identifies as non-binary, Winter said they attract a lot of clients interested in gender play or cross dressing. Animal Crossing allows for users to easily try on different styles of clothing regardless of gender. Winter said video games make such activities much more accessible.“Video games have been a way for people to explore their identity for a long time,” they said. “This venue has attracted a lot of young gamers who want to dip their toes into getting dominated. It’s completely safe to submit to someone in an Animal Crossing game – if you don’t like it, you can log off at any moment.”Finding a venue for a date can be stressful, and perhaps doubly so during lockdown. But New York-based social media manager Christine Davitt found when connecting with a partner she met on Tinder, Animal Crossing was the perfect low-pressure place to get to know one another.Davitt said she and her partner had been chatting for hours on Houseparty and other video chat apps when she asked them on a date on Animal Crossing. Despite connecting on other platforms previously, the couple considers it to be their first date.“It felt liberating to be able to ‘sit’ on a bench together gazing at the moon, to ‘run’ around after each other and chase butterflies, to go ‘fishing’ together behind their house,” she said. “It just felt more real.”Davitt is not alone – a number of people have been using the platform for dates, one couple used it as a wedding venue, and another user tweeted an Animal Crossing proposal last week.Now one month after their first date, Davitt and her partner are quarantined together – in real life. They still play Animal Crossing together every day, but now side by side.Screenwriter Gary Whitta had been playing Animal Crossing with his wife and daughter for weeks when he decided to recreate a late night talk show set in his game universe.Whitta set up a desk next to a couch and added a drum set for a live “band”. Now the project, which started as a pretend talk show set in a video game, is attracting real celebrity guests.Last week he interviewed actress Felicia Day and previously he hosted a live concert with musician Raquel Lily, which 12,000 viewers watched on Twitch, where he streams his shows. He makes the show with the help of his wife Leah Whitta and the show’s video editor Adam Nickerson.Whitta’s effort to make an in-game talk show comes as actual primetime talk show hosts are being forced to film their own segments at home. “At this point, there’s no difference between what we do and what The Tonight Show does,” Whitta said.One benefit of Animal Crossing-hosted shows versus the traditional talk show is that guests can participate from anywhere in the world, Whitta said. Recent episodes have hosted guests based in Montpellier, France New York City and Canada. Whitta is based in San Francisco.“Video games are starting to transcend the concept of video games as we understand them,” he said. “They are becoming a part of this idea of the metaverse where they evolve into a place where people go to hang out.”Whitta said the popularity of his show and Animal Crossing in general underscores the need for shared community during the ongoing global crisis – whether in person or online.“I really think Animal Crossing has come into everyone’s life at exactly the right time,” he said. “Everyone is locked in their houses and looking for some kind of escape or a distraction, and Animal Crossing is a game that allows you to escape to this beautiful tropical island paradise where everyone is your friend – it is just the tonic everyone needs right now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c8d13834806f077298a10c3854bdaa81d2ca2cf/0_123_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2245c3ae8a40820289345631087d42","title":"coronavirus cycling boom makes a good bike hard to find","story":"Would-be cyclists keen to exercise during the lockdown have cleared stores of their stock Isabel had not ridden a bike since university 10 years ago when lockdown motivated her to seek out two wheels. But half a dozen cycle shops in south London gave her the same answer: no chance. We’re out of stock.One or two said they could sell her a high-spec racing bike for a price in the region of £1,000. The others advised her to place an order, wait a couple of weeks for the bicycle to be delivered from the manufacturer, then another week or so for it to be built by the store. And there was no option to try before buying.Since the lockdown began, bicycle manufacturers and shops across the UK have reported a boom in demand, and many expect a further increase in sales as people consider resuming journeys to work when restrictions ease.Up to 20,000 bicycles which have already been sold are awaiting delivery and building, according to the Association of Cycle Traders. “Sudden demand from essential workers and the significant adoption of cycling for exercise, travel and family leisure during the pandemic, further fuelled by good weather, is putting an extreme demand upon the industry,” it said.Cycle repair shops have also seen a surge in business as people have brought unused bikes stored in garages and sheds back on the roads.Bike retailers are permitted to remain open during the lockdown, but are operating “one in, one out” policies and banning customers from trying out cycles before they buy.Isabel listed three reasons why she wanted a bike. “It’s a way of getting out of the house, and is good for my mental and physical health. Whenever the lockdown eases, it’s a way of avoiding public transport. And I’ve always thought about cycling in London but the traffic made me nervous. Now seems a good time to try it.”In the end, she found a secondhand bike for sale online, and has joined the growing number of new and returning cyclists on the UK’s roads.“The roads are quieter, the air is cleaner and there are clear physical and mental health benefits to cycling,” said Keith Irving, chief executive of Cycling Scotland. “There has always been a latent demand for cycling in the UK, and now that there’s an opportunity for a safer and more pleasant experience, people are grabbing it with both hands.”London has also seen a big rise in bike use, with predictions that the number of cyclists on the roads could increase tenfold when lockdown restrictions are eased. Commuting to work by public transport is expected to be challenging, as limits on the numbers of people on buses and tubes are enforced and people’s fears about the risks of infection remain.According to Will Norman, the capital’s walking and cycling commissioner, restrictions on public transport mean that up to 8 million journeys every day will have to be made by alternative means. “If just a fraction switch to cars, London will grind to a halt, choking our economic recovery,” he said.Heidi Alexander, London deputy mayor for transport, tweeted last week about “the experience of a 45-year-old, overweight woman” taking to the roads on her bike. “Life is going to be pretty different for a while. We are going to need to change how we move around the city. I’d love this horrible period to lead to hundreds of thousands of women (and men!) in London taking to their bikes – being healthier and happier as a consequence.”But not everyone is happy about the cycling boom. A sign in rural Cambridgeshire last month urged cyclists to “stay away” and “stop panting viruses through our village”, and Little Bollington parish council in Cheshire removed a notice directed at cyclists telling them to “stay in your local area” after objections.Boards with six-inch nails were planted in woods in east Cleveland in what appears to have been an attempt to discourage cyclists, and there were reports of a “large amount of nailstacks” being placed in London’s Regent’s Park in “an attack on cyclists”.Nevertheless, Paul Tomlinson, cycling director at Halfords, said: “With public transport heavily reduced and social distancing measures likely to stay in place for some time, we think many more people will turn to cycling as an alternative way of commuting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad9078cd89ab1ada12ac780707010c22e965537/162_0_2096_1258/master/2096.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=51d65746040a84521abcee50d5224188","title":"data covid 19 numbers story pandemic guardian statistics","story":"’s data journalists in the UK, US and Australia explain how they have shone a light on the statistical narrative behind the pandemic, and what they have helped to reveal Creating data journalism about Covid-19 has felt different. For one thing, the public aren’t thinking of the statistics as dry and abstract: they understand how critical they are. People are learning about methodologies and bell curves and logarithmic scales because they’re no longer inclined to look away from the screen when they see those words. That means there are also huge opportunities to learn and for people to change their (usually negative!) relationship with numbers.I think we’ve always had the responsibility to inform without making people feel afraid, alone or sad. At first though, especially here in the US, it felt like not enough people were sufficiently scared. It was fear that was compelling me to stay at home – fear of making other people sick and fear of getting sick myself. So I was trying to create data visualisations that had that emotional resonance too. Illustrations that showed the numbers in a way that communicated the seriousness of this situation. I think that now the need has shifted a little where most people grasp the gravity of the situation. They need information about how to cope.Data is key in this crisis. It tells us the story of how the virus is spreading, who it affects most and, with political will, it could help pave the way out.I am fascinated by what is left out of datasets. What we collect and omit tells us something about what we value and overlook as a society. If you don’t have data you can’t understand a problem or begin to formulate effective public policy to address it. As a journalist the gaps in datasets also give you a sense of what is not understood and should be examined in greater depth. This line of thinking has informed much of our reporting to date.We have uncovered flaws in the government death toll, shown how the most deprived would be disproportionately affected if parks were closed, revealed BAME people are more at risk of dying from Covid-19, and explored why the poor are twice as likely to die of the virus as the rich.Work is incredibly demanding at the moment. Very often we’re trying to make sense of new information and patchy datasets in a rapidly evolving crisis. So far data has shown us that the virus is certainly not a social leveller, rather it has found the cracks in society and blown them wide open, making long-standing inequalities painfully clear. By inquiring beyond the headline numbers, data can help us understand who the virus is affecting the most so we can forge a fairer society once this has passed.Counting the human cost of the coronavirus has been one of the greatest challenges faced professionally by journalists since the onset of the pandemic: even the number of deaths is genuinely hard to provide. Part of the problem is that data collection and reporting by the responsible agencies in the UK and elsewhere has been slow to become uniform: ordinarily deaths are collected by statistical bodies with a delay. But deaths due to Covid-19 are of obvious public interest and so the figures need to be circulated. Therefore, for data journalists like myself, much of the past two months has been spent chasing data figuring out which deaths have and have not been included in various organisations’ figures finding out what we can and cannot compare. As a  journalist you are always focused on reporting the truth. Never has this been more pronounced than in this crisis, where you are hyper-aware that underreporting the figures could cause complacency whereas exaggerating them could cause panic. Some have criticised journalists for not being critical enough while others wrongly, and dangerously, suggest that the figures are exaggerated. But it isn’t those people we concern ourselves with: it is getting to the truth and pointing out what we know when we know it. This means that we aren’t just putting out a BIG FIGURE and leaving it at that. Instead we are explaining why we think the BIG FIGURE isn’t the whole picture. We have faith in our audience’s ability to recognise that we may not have all the answers right now but that we are working tirelessly to get them.Australia is now a success story in terms of its early response to Covid-19, with new cases now often below 20 a day, and far fewer deaths per million people than other countries. How this early success in flattening the curve transitions into an easing of restrictions and the prospect of a second wave remains to be seen.When the pandemic started worsening in Australia, there were significant challenges with reporting on basic aspects of the outbreak.Because of the difference in reporting times and methods, getting basic information correct such as the number of cases, deaths, and testing rates required staying on top of information released by nine governments.Inspired by other projects doing similar work we started tracking these figures internally, and then decided to release the data with a licence allowing reuse. This decision paid off – the data has been used by researchers, private companies and ordinary citizens to analyse and visualise the pandemic’s impact on Australia.Having the data openly accessible also means our figures are constantly being checked, ensuring they are as accurate as possible. This was especially helpful in the early days when significant time pressure would inevitably mean some mistakes – thankfully quickly corrected in response to reader emails.The response has been phenomenal. The summary page has been one of the most popular pieces we have produced during the pandemic, with 5.4m page views at the time of writing. The data also is used in all our liveblogs to give readers a quick summary of the current situation.We realised very early on that the story of the coronavirus crisis would benefit hugely from visually led coverage – we published our first visual explainer on the topic in early February, when the overwhelming majority of confirmed cases and deaths were still being reported in China.From this early stage, our audience was eager to understand the details of the story. We wanted to report on it in a way that was easy to understand and offered clear conclusions. Using maps and charts, we were able to analyse the quantity and speed with which the disease multiplied each day. Our visual trackers evolved as we were able to establish comparisons between countries, put the data into historical context and shed light on different scenarios playing out in different regions.Visual journalists around the world are coming up with ever more ingenious ways of explaining and contextualising the numbers, from case counts to reproduction numbers, to the tragic death toll of the virus.“Flatten the curve” is perhaps the best example of a visualisation so well designed and so memorable that it has become a universally understood metaphor for a concept that would require a much lengthier explanation if one tried to convey it through words alone.Our team is following the lively debate within the data visualisation community closely, and we’re constantly working to improve our own coronavirus trackers while experimenting with new formats to communicate the scale of the emergency. We have also experienced a growing interest from our readers in how we make our graphics, with a variety of questions reaching us each day via email and social networks.As the global pandemic continues, we’re using visuals to drive home the dramatic change that the virus has spurred in the way we live and work – from mapping how lockdown measures have slashed global air pollution to quantifying the disastrous impact on the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0cc3b05df4b50ec6a46402a0ee9338cbfab3ec6/0_1039_4798_2875/master/4798.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=768ff3c6d499c8c296baed42fcdf71f3","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

It’s the knowledge that I’m losing my teenage years.” Betsy checks herself before adding: “Well – one or two years, probably.”The coronavirus has affected all our lives, but six weeks since schools shut across the UK there is evidence that teenagers in particular are struggling.A study of 60,000 people in lockdown by University College London found that the youngest in the sample, 18- to 24-year-olds, had the lowest levels of life satisfaction, while the highest was recorded in the over-60s.It is easy to see why that may be the case. Exams young people have been told will shape the rest of their lives have been cancelled, future plans – for work, travel or further study – cast into uncertainty. Incipient independence has been rudely interrupted.Physical distancing goes against adolescent impulse, says Loades: to assert themselves as iniduals, away from their parents to spend time with their friends, to take risks, to act without thinking of consequences.“We’re asking teenagers to be very responsible and mature, and to make sensible decisions for the greater good of society,” she says. “I think that’s probably quite a conflict.”Loades says school leavers in particular will be suffering the loss of milestones such as exams, last-day rituals such as shirt signing and leavers’ assemblies, and end-of-year parties.“Those kinds of experiences help us to make sense of endings that might feel painful and difficult, and to move on from one stage of life to another,” she adds.For many young people, the cancellation of exams comes not as relief, but as anticlimax. “Obviously no one really wants to do exams, but … there were subjects that I knew I could push myself in,” says Betsy.She expects to pass her GCSEs on the strength of her mock exam marks, and is relieved she put in the effort. “You get told that your mock exams don’t mean anything – now it means a lot. For people who were going to try during ‘the real thing’, it’s probably quite hard.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Others have already had to adapt to online learning. Charlotte Lewis, 17, from Shropshire, has had her entire timetable moved on to Microsoft Teams before her A-levels next summer. The learning curve has been steep: lessons are dense, self-directed and marred by technical difficulties.“At school you can bounce off each other – it’s a lot harder to do that now,” she says. “We have some teachers who have never used the platform before, so we had to teach them.”Her friend Josh Foster, also 17, says some people have already started muting the teacher and watching Netflix instead. “As long as they’ve logged into class,” she adds.Josh says teachers seem to be overcompensating with homework, forcing him to cram until 2am and seek extensions to keep up. “I feel that we’re quite hindered compared to last year’s year 12s.” Support from both his school and prospective universities has been lacking, he continues. “I’m in a position where I don’t know what to do to have the best chance of getting into a university.”The economic fallout from the pandemic has already darkened the outlook for the 800,000 school leavers and graduates in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank predicts that the “corona class of 2020” are the group most at risk of unemployment, and face long-term damage to their career and pay prospects.Ava Twomey, 17, from south London, is having to reckon with her chosen industry going into freefall, just as she finished her Btec qualification.She has dreamed of working as an airline cabin crew member since she was 13. “I really love travelling, airplanes, airports – I’m a bit obsessed.” British Airways was her first choice, after she did work experience there last year and “fell in love”.But BA has been upended by the collapse in aviation, and recently set out plans to make up to 12,000 staff redundant. “It’s not looking too good at the moment,” says Ava, “but I’m trying to stay positive.”Exercise helped, until she overdid the running and tore her tendon now she FaceTimes her friends and binge-watches Made in Chelsea and The Only Way Is Essex. “It’s just so comforting,” she says apologetically.Many teenagers have sought solace in Netflix. Betsy is storming through Gossip Girl at a rate of 2.5 series a week. Charlotte and her friends have watched the Twilight and Harry Potter films together using the Netflix Party app (“She made me watch Clueless,” says Josh, grumbling).They used to go to Wetherspoons to do their homework, says Charlotte now they gather on FaceTime and Zoom. “We’re just doing what we normally do, but online.”Tope Olufemi, 19 , abruptly returned from his first year at the University of Warwick to his parents’ home in north London. He says screen time has gone “through the roof. People are on social media 247.”Jakob McMaster, 17, from Belfast, has found it harder to adapt. He used to spend his days at school or outdoors, exploring abandoned buildings and forests with his friends.“I don’t think I’ve stayed inside the house this long since I was 12 … We thrive off being outside.”He has also been separated from his boyfriend of one year, who attends the same school. Before lockdown, the longest they had been apart was three days.Two months into isolating with his parents and younger siblings, Jakob says he feels bored and uncharacteristically irritable, like “time is merging together”.“I get peaks of motivation where it’s like: ‘I have all the time in the world, I should start baking!.’ But as soon as I get the stuff ready for it, I’m like: ‘This is meaningless – we’re just stuck here.’”Jakob has had weekly therapy since he was 11, but now his sessions have been put on hold. He has noticed the impact of the loss of support and being confined on his depression: “I have the kind that makes me want to bounce off the walls.”The combination of being siloed with their family and separated from their friends has many young people living inside a pressure cooker, says Loades.Her review of 63 studies on isolation and loneliness in teenagers suggested physical distancing was likely to put them at higher risk of depression, and probably anxiety. The longer the lockdown restrictions go on, the worse outcomes are likely to lead to, says Loades.The long-term effects of isolation on teenagers will differ greatly by inidual,as well as factors such as access to technology, amount of personal space and relationship with their family, says says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit at the University of Cambridge. “We can already see inequalities arising.”Orben predicts that teenagers will at least find being apart from their peers a negative experience. “The importance of the social world for adolescents can’t be overstated,” she says.For some teenagers, the isolation coronavirus has caused is nothing new. Last year, research by the charity Mencap found one in three young people with a learning disability spend less than an hour outside their home on a typical Saturday.Joey Mander, 21, is an NHS sterile services technician and youth activist in Coventry. He hopes one silver lining of the pandemic is recognition that “for some of us, this is just our ordinary”. At 16 he was diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a rare genetic mutation, and now uses a wheelchair.He says the restriction and loss of autonomy “the world has been forced to experience, is the very thing that people” with a disability face as part of their day-to-day experience.For Mander, who also has autism, the pandemic has disrupted his routines and led to a cut in the hours of his support worker just as own his job has become more high-pressured than ever. “I’m having to fight very hard to get through each day.”He has found solace in drawing – he is adapting Rosie the Riveter to show “a person in scrubs like mine” – and CYA Saturdays, a group of young disability advocates, now meeting twice weekly on Zoom. “I just want to touch someone’s hand. That’s what I keep saying,” says Mander.Loades says it is important for teenagers to know coronavirus is a challenge for everyone – and that within that there may be opportunity to gain new perspectives, skills and maturity. Her previous research, on the experience of isolation by young people with chronic illness, has shown that “through adversity comes strength”.Some teenagers are using lockdown to challenge themselves and support their family. Betsy often cooks dinner, and bakes “just for something to do”. Ava says she appreciates her friendships more, and has enjoyed the extra bonding time with her parents: “I’ve learnt more about them as people.”Charlotte and her friends are each keeping journals on a different aspect of life during a pandemic: “It’s going to be quite interesting to look back and tell the kids about.”She is interested in going into journalism, and coronavirus has proved a crash course in media literacy. “We’re thinking: is what we’re being told scaremongering? Is it actually as serious as they’re saying, or more serious?”For Tope, the lockdown has reinforced the importance of politics. “Even though it’s not affecting us equally, it’s affecting all of us.” He has been talking about the government response and mismanagement scandals with his friends. “A lot of people are realising that politics affects you on a daily basis, even if it doesn’t feel like it.”With many teenagers concerned for their essential-worker parents or elderly parents, the stakes of the crisis are not lost on them. Nor is it the fact that it will pass – and sooner, if they follow the rules.Betsy says most people she knows have been adhering to physical distancing. When one posted on social media about meeting up with their friends, the response was of anger.“There was a lot of: ‘What do you not understand about not going out?’” she says. “A lot of people got quite vocal, just the ignorance of it. “Obviously the more people that go out, the longer we’re in it.”Betsy is already looking forward to the party that will be thrown once this is all over. For now, she says: “Me not being able to hang out with my friends is not the biggest problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae7f36be66221a7c60376c72adb65070863c55a/0_149_4466_2679/master/4466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b16d393df69dfb59452c90b02ef16ae7","title":"tennis makes tentative resumption with some exhibition stuff","story":"It is among the most international of sports, but countries have had to look inwardly in order to restart the actionOn Thursday afternoon in Minsk, elite international athletes returned to competition. Two Belarusians kicked tennis off as the world No 11, Aryna Sabalenka, and the No 50, Aliaksandra Sasnovich, took to the court. Even in Belarus, where the country has relentlessly carried on as much of the world around it has come to a halt, the scene underlined the new normal.The pair humbled themselves to picking up their own balls and their stage was a small indoor hard court lined with one linesman per side and a handful of spectators. After Sabalenka sealed the victory, the two friends were not allowed to embrace. They tapped the other’s racquet and Sabalenka blew a kiss. They laughed.Tennis has returned, but with a catch. As an inherently socially distant sport, it is one of the first ones back in some form. As a sprawling globalised professional circuit in the time of travel bans and mandatory quarantines, it is also one of the professional sports at risk of not returning at all in 2020.As if to underline the disconnect on Friday, as more tennis matches resumed, the Canadian government announced the cancellation of most sporting events until 31 August, which will likely lead to the scuppering of this year’s Roger’s Cup in Toronto. The tour is set to return on 13 July before the US hard court swing, but the future is still in doubt.In the absence of the professional tour, tennis has been carved up by borders as new national exhibitions spring up with every passing day. This month the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany claimed victory over coronavirus restrictions. This weekend, the US network Tennis Channel broadcast the UTR Pro Match Series, an exhibition between four players held with no linespeople, set on a desolate patch of private land in West Palm Beach, Florida. The only spectator: a cow munching grass nearby.Some of these events have been erected out of necessity, allowing players to compete and maintain their level while earning a few small dollars – Dominic Thiem will imminently return to action in Austria and national competitions are also being formulated in Australia, Germany, Britain and Spain.Other private initiatives, such as the Ultimate Tennis Showdown masterminded by Patrick Mouratoglou, appear to have money primarily in mind. There is one clear issue: some national federations do not have the finances or talent pool to match the initiatives of richer European nations and their players are at another disadvantage.Although necessary, it is still jarring to see tennis partitioned by borders because of how antithetical it is to aspects of the sport. The location of the coronavirus outbreak alone underlines how tennis touches so many parts of the globe. As many of the eyes of the world focused on Wuhan for the first time, the most notable export is the two-times slam champion Li Na and its most significant annual international event is the Premier 5 WTA event, held since 2014.Tennis was born as a localised sport with tournaments such as the French and the Australian Opens created as national events, but over the past few decades it has expanded its reach. While fans often identify their favourites based on the game styles and personalities they like rather than solely on whom they live closest to, players compete wherever around the world is most advantageous for them and they play for themselves.Likewise, part of the professional experience is interacting with different cultures. Today, most top 100 players can fluently express their thoughts and emotions in English and interact freely with different nationalities. In 1968, the first Wimbledon of the open era, 47 of 64 men’s doubles pairings were of the same nationality. Twenty-five pairs of compatriots played in the event at the Australian Open this year.The nature of the sport also means so many players are multinational at heart they were raised in one country, born in another and build their games elsewhere. The British No 1, Johanna Konta, was born an Australian in Sydney to Hungarian parents, trained in Barcelona at 14 before moving to Eastbourne and becoming a British citizen. The face of the coming Olympics is the Haitian-Japanese Naomi Osaka, who was born in Osaka, grew up in New York and is sick of people asking about her ethnicity. Even those who simply move abroad at a young age still recognise how their identity is affected. Russia’s Svetlana Kuznetsova, who moved to Barcelona at 13, said: “The thing is what I found out really that I cannot work with people who speak Russian, because I speak Spanish tennis in my head. I won’t understand the language of Russian coaches, it’s different.”As tennis looks inward and nations take care of their own, those aspects of the sport will be present for a while. At a time when international cooperation has stuttered, it feels necessary to note them and to ensure that tennis reaches even more people when it resumes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07d0ece6921e15832f8f7dd0982f2e38cd88c6d/0_179_960_575/master/960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=904d44ac31e771de4f132c35e4269298","title":"nightwaves radio review gemma cairney no signal 10 v 10 race and covid 19 bbc local radio","story":"The best of lockdown live radio, from soundclash battles to urgent topical discussionNightwaves Radio nightwaves.radioNo Signal: 10 v 10 theresnosignalRace and Covid-19 BBC Local Radio | BBC SoundsMuch is written – often by me – about the intimate connection between podcasts and their listeners, but radio shows have that too. Plus radio is live: an exciting quality in a time when living on the edge means shuffling your bum forward a little on the sofa. “Everyone’s making a podcast,” observed Gemma Cairney, early in her first live internet radio show, Nightwaves Radio, which made its debut broadcast on Wednesday evening, “but I’m very, very passionate about creating something live during lockdown.”Cairney, an audio veteran who’s presented for BBC Radio 1 Xtra, Radio 4 and 6 Music, was trying to do a non-podcast: a live show, with her producer working remotely, that played great music, offered lovely interviews and had listeners call in to chat. Just a normal radio programme, really: but tricky technically, without hordes of tech-heads in the same room as the microphone, internet server, mobile phone and host.Partly, Cairney’s motivation was to ease lockdown loneliness. “I’m desperate to pour out my love for music and art and people,” she said. Partly, it was to create sonic inventiveness (the producer, Buddy Peace, works with musician and podcaster Scroobius Pip). A lot of ambition for a small show, and the first few minutes were shaky – Cairney has a lot of friends and too many people were trying to listen for her technical setup to cope, you suspect – but things settled down.Exemplary music choices helped (Marvin Gaye, J Dilla, Gil Scott-Heron). Cairney herself was a little scattered, but better when talking to others, especially the wonderful Bob Harris about his pirate radio years. Perhaps one question or theme per show would focus energies, and give everyone something to talk about other than the weirdness of social isolation: Nightwaves Radio is an experiment that could grow into something wonderful.Another, very different, live internet radio show has exploded over the past few weeks. No Signal’s 10 v 10 shows are a massive worldwide success, with over a million listening to Vybz Kartel v Wizkid last weekend, on YouTube and on No Signal’s website plus equally enormous numbers for its three shows this week. 10 v 10 is a soundclash show. Two artists’ tunes are put up directly against each other, track by track. Each artist has a champion, who chooses the tracks and gives out a bit of banter and argy about it. There’s a host, who keeps things moving, and listeners react online. Doesn’t sound like much? Honestly, these shows are such a buzz. When 10 v 10 goes out live, Twitter goes bananas (Burnaboy and his mum went live on Instagram in support of WizKid, who won 10-0, causing much emotion). Tens of thousands of listeners vote on each track-clash: madly impressive, given they only have 10 minutes to vote. On Monday it was Chris Brown v Usher (Usher won 6-4 on Wednesday, WSTRN v N-Dubz (N-Dubz won 6-4).Spotify has started putting up the tracklists from the shows, but the real buzz is from listening as they go out. 10 v 10 has the blow-your-head-off hit of live sport, the who-will-win excitement of a TV game show final, the Twitter jokes-rush of both – but with brilliant music, so it’s even better.More liveness. On Wednesday, BBC local radio stations came together for an important hour-long show, Race and Covid-19, which discussed why BAME people have been more deeply affected by the coronavirus. Hosted by Karen Gabay in Manchester, Summaya Mughal in Leicester and Dotun Adebayo in London, this was a vital listen. Medics and experts came on to explain the various, interlocking reasons why people from minority ethic groups have suffered so much more, and relevant points were made regarding work, housing, culture, religion and language. It was left to the callers to bring up racism directly. Vinnie from Liverpool talked about being “second-best” in the UK Tamil, a junior doctor from London, said “it comes down to racism and discrimination”. Public Health England is conducting a governmental review into “what role ethnicity has played in this pandemic”, but no spokesperson would come on the show. Too live, perhaps. Catch up on BBC Sounds.Frank Skinner’s Poetry PodcastYes, you did read that right. Frank Skinner, comedian and host of Absolute Radio’s Saturday morning show, has a new poetry podcast. This might seem a new direction for a man once known for his promotion of football and porn, but Skinner is a poetry enthusiast. Each week, he takes one or two poems and talks about them, with insight and delight. The most recent, about Donna Stonecipher’s 2015 poem Model City, has him in raptures (“meaning is only part of the deal”) and his joy is catching. I would shave 10 minutes off each show, but otherwise these are perfect.Elis James and John Robins: The Isolation Tapes The 5 Live presenters stay apart together with a funny show about… well, all the stuff that’s caused by these strange times. Whether kicking a ball with your daughter is allowed or not. How having a big cry is OK. Though there are guests, the listening pleasure is all in their gentle geniality (along with that of producers Dave Masterman, and sometimes Jess Temby), and the celebration of each other’s foibles. Robins has many, including being obsessed with Queen (the band), and bringing accountancy folders to stay with his girlfriend, just in case. Hilarious and sweet.Katherine Ryan: Telling Everyone EverythingThis show started strongly a month ago, with comedian Ryan talking about her miscarriage, and has been in the iTunes Top 10 every since. Ryan is acerbic and honest, straightforward and relevant – the show is recorded every week, with her quick-witted reaction to what’s happened to her, whether major (pregnancy loss), middling (watching The Last Dance, making TikToks) or minor (reacting to odd people on social media). Her American accent isn’t soothing, but abrasive. And some of us enjoy that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6fd40cc1bb86a1b3df029ebe40b65401f61757a/49_627_5045_3028/master/5045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe396a5b939a681989da811fb8b0a49a","title":"vanessa feltz nickname vanessa the undresser preserve your mystique at all costs","story":"The broadcaster, 58, on God, privacy, Mini convertibles, the rudeness of Madonna and her school nickname, Vanessa the UndresserEven aged two, I was a child of great perspicacity. At nursery we had to answer the register by saying “Yes, Auntie” or “Present, please”, which I found deeply confusing. First, I thought, you’re not my auntie. And if I’m asking politely for a present every day, where on earth is it?Vanessa the Undresser was my nickname at school, and I put that down to my parents. When a sex scene started on TV I was banished to the hall. I’d stand with one ear against the door desperately trying to work out who was doing what to whom and in what position. Thus was aroused in me an unshakable thirst for sex in all its permutations. I’ve never tired of it, menopause or not.A chorus of disapproval accompanied my childhood. If I went to wash my hair, there’d be one grandma on the phone and another in the kitchen both asking, isn’t it too late? Too early? Didn’t you wash it yesterday? I became accustomed to being constantly commented on and deconstructed. Suddenly you’re grown up, they’re all dead, and it’s lonely and quiet.All I wanted from Cambridge University was my own Sabbath table cloth and a nice Jewish husband. I would be stopped by staff every time I went to the library – a girl dressed like me with bleached blonde hair? Must be an interloper. I simply went to follow the boy I loved. I was damned if he was going anywhere without me.Preserve your mystique at all costs – that’s the best advice I was ever given. Don’t let everything hang out in front of your other half, no shaving of legs or other ablutions. Anything bodily you do in private, preferably not in the same postcode as the man you’d like to seduce.I’d be entirely obnoxious if I let my desire to correct people’s speech and grammar run rampant. If someone is talking about the “tenants of their beliefs”, I find it colossally difficult not to interrupt and explain: “It’s ‘tenets’, actually.” Still, I don’t, else I’d be churlish and disgusting.My belief in God was confirmed in a Mini convertible. When neither of my girls had yet found Mr Right, I’d fervently pray out of the open roof: “God, send them please a man they’ll love, someone who’ll be faithful and look after them.” They both met nice Jewish boys straight after, and that settled it in my mind.There’s no greater preparation for lockdown than two stints on Big Brother. It taught me how to survive constraint, to not take everything too personally or seriously. Most of all, though, I learned to really appreciate the life I have: other people loved the experience, but I was miserable being away from my loved ones at home.I wasn’t starstruck when I sat on the bed to interview Madonna, but I did have the urge to strike her. She turned up seven hours late and was rude, unbearably high-handed and disinterested. Had I been a violent person, I might have hit her hard around the face.Talking about my weight became tiring a long time ago. I had hoped having gastric band surgery in 2010 would make me a magnificent Twiglet like Cheryl Tweedy, but it wasn’t very effective, so I had a gastric bypass a couple of years back and became a slim size 12. If people ask about it now I tell them I didn’t do it myself so they should talk to my surgeon.I’ve stayed off social media and had never had an iPod, tablet or computer. I’ve done two radio shows a day for 10 years I have my newspaper column and Agony Aunt slots on This Morning. I’ve got enough places to say how I feel without inflicting my opinion on anyone further.I’ve been called “the woman who ate her audience”. One quality broadsheet said I had breasts like World War One barrage balloons. And those are among the more flattering comments.

Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.“But our streets are not empty: they are filled with the love and care that we have for each other. And, when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”The country united during a two-minute silence at 11am as people stood, heads bowed at front doors in bunting-lined streets, and wreaths were laid at war memorials in small, physically-distanced ceremonies.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall led the national moment of remembrance, paying their respects in Scotland at the Balmoral war memorial , placing a wreath and bouquet of spring flowers from their garden at nearby Birkhall as a lone piper played. A cannon at Edinburgh castle started and ended the silence, as a Spitfire flypast soared over the iconic white cliffs of Dover.Earlier, the Red Arrows streamed red, white and blue as they roared over central London, passing above The Mall, now deserted but which was to have been packed with thousands ahead of a veterans parade and the scene of joyful reunions with old comrades. RAF Typhoon jets performed flypasts over Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.Extracts from Churchill’s historic victory speech were broadcast, followed by the “Nation’s Toast”: “To those who gave so much, we thank you.” Royal Navy warships and support vessels blasted their sirens to mark the occasion. Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset.With original elaborate plans hastily rearranged because of Covid-19, the wartime generation who Boris Johnson said had “carried the fate of freedom on their shoulders” were confined to their homes. Crowded street parties, one of the defining images of VE Day, are banned.But even strict social distancing measures could not mute the mood of celebration, as households across the country evoked the spirit of the 1940s, some dressing in period costume and hosting household tea parties. Where possible, care homes organised singalongs and festivities for residents. One second world war veteran, Eric Bradshaw, 95, isolated in his Oldham care home owing to Covid-19, was surprised by a special salute by Royal British Legion members and RAF cadets.It may not have been the day planned, but VE Day 75 will itself become a part of history.Speaking at the same hour her father, George VI, delivered his historic broadcast on a “great deliverance” 75 years ago, the Queen paid tribute to the many who “laid down their lives in that terrible conflict” and died “so we could live as free people in a world of free nations”.“We should and will remember them,” she said.In the broadcast, pre-recorded at Windsor castle, she recalled a VE Day which “some of us experienced first hand”. The Queen was a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Services (ATS) and the khaki cap she wore was placed on her desk. With a photograph of her father also prominently displayed, and wearing the Boucheron aquamarine and diamond clip brooches he gave her for her 18th birthday, she said: “I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.” The “sense of joy” in the crowds was “profound” she said.The greatest tribute to all those who did not come back from the war “was to ensure it didn’t happen again,” she said. Once sworn enemies were now friends “working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all”.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, observed the silence in Downing Street, having earlier written to veterans stressing that “our gratitude will be eternal”.“On this anniversary, we are engaged in a new struggle against the coronavirus, which demands the same spirit of national endeavour that you exemplified 75 years ago,” he wrote. “We cannot pay our tribute with the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past your loved ones may be unable to visit in person.“But please allow us, your proud compatriots, to be the first to offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”He also spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to mark the anniversary. “They paid tribute to the collaboration between British and Russian forces during the second world war, including through the Arctic convoys, and to the heroism and sacrifice of all those who lost their lives,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Dramatically scaled-back events included a BBC programme of celebration, featuring stars including the Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins, and broadcast from the quadrangle at Buckingham Palace, which itself emerged bomb-scarred from the blitz.The Queen’s address was immediately followed by a nationwide rendition of the wartime classic We’ll Meet Again, with Dame Vera Lynn, 103, joining from her home in East Sussex, and the public singing from their doorsteps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d820573af38f1c17f49712a26f8a370b450d69/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00b9343cf66b535300b85363aea2923f","title":"plan to open schools on 1 june in doubt as unions say safety in doubt","story":"Joint statement insists return will not happen until stringent ‘test and trace’ regime in placeMinisters’ plans to reopen schools as early as 1 June are in serious doubt after unions representing teachers and school staff insisted that they would not consider a return without a stringent coronavirus “test and trace” regime.In an unusual joint statement, which one senior union official said indicated that an early return to a normal school timetable was “off the menu”, the Trades Union Congress said that there should be “no increase in pupil numbers until full rollout of a national test and trace scheme”, and called for the establishment of a Covid-19 taskforce with government, unions and others to agree on the safe reopening of schools.But with a national strategy for a scheme that would help identify who needs to be in quarantine yet to be deployed – and a contact-tracing phone app still undergoing a limited trial on the Isle of Wight – the unions’ tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date floated by officials last week.That could mean children in England and Wales returning to schools for just a few weeks between now and the new school year in September, and pupils in Scotland – who break up earlier – increasingly unlikely to return before the summer holidays at all.The Scottish and Welsh governments have already announced that their schools will not reopen on 1 June.The news comes amid growing signs that Boris Johnson will set out a cautious “roadmap” for the next phase of the crisis on Sunday after the government faced severe criticism over its mixed messages about what the public should expect.The statement, submitted to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is backed by the main teaching unions, as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, which represent key school staff such as cleaners, administrators and caterers. Any return without their agreement is highly unlikely.“The wider reopening of our schools will depend greatly on ensuring that families and carers are fully confident that allowing their children to return to school is safe. We do not believe that sufficient levels of confidence exist at this time,” it said.Johnson told last weekend’s Sun on Sunday: “One of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get primary schools back. It’s not going to be easy, but that’s where we want to go. It’s about working out a way to do it.”Whitehall sources suggested at the time he had in mind a phased return from the beginning of June, after the summer half-term break.But the  understands that conversations with headteachers and trade unions in recent days have underlined the practical challenges of the move – and the potential resistance from parents anxious about their children’s safety. A government source insisted on Friday: “We never set a date.”Ahead of Johnson’s address to the nation, the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Friday played down suggestions of any major changes to the lockdown regime, stressing that the government would proceed “with the utmost caution”.At the press briefing, Eustice also stressed the importance of abiding by the existing measures over the bank holiday weekend, despite the fact that the government is poised to allow unlimited exercise, sunbathing and picnics from Monday.But he welcomed moves by some businesses to reopen where existing restrictions already allow – including McDonald’s. “Our view is that McDonald’s drive-through is made for the social distancing system that we are in,” he said.The Welsh government stole a march on Johnson on Friday by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, insisted that the lockdown needed to stay, but said “very cautious” changes would come into force. He anticipated that “broadly” similar changes would be announced by the prime minister.He said that from Monday, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, provided that they do not travel “a significant distance” from their home. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen if they can ensure that the 2-metre physical distancing rule is enforced. And councils will begin work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.The announcement came as Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she believed “all four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages”, although she expected ergence from England’s upcoming new guidance to be minor.The TUC’s tests include “clear scientific published evidence” that reopening schools will not increase the transmission of Covid-19 agreement between government, unions and employers over minimum safety standards for social distancing and hygiene and a ”secure supply” of PPE for school staff.But the key demand is that opening up schools cannot begin until there is a “full rollout” of the government’s test, trace and isolate policy, with targets for testing being consistently met and the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 falling.Williamson has maintained that his top priority is the safety of children, and said that the question of when and how to reopen schools is the government’s most difficult decision.The teaching unions and the Department for Education have been consulting closely in recent days, with ministers and advisers contacting inidual headteachers and academy leaders to canvass their views. Following the discussions, the DfE believes the TUC’s tests do not differ significantly from those set out by the government to end the lockdown.Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in the development of coronavirus tracing apps in countries including Switzerland and Germany, said it was possible that the first NHS tracing app could be ready by 1 June. But he warned that an app alone would be unlikely to be sufficient to curb a Covid-19 outbreak affecting schools.“The question is, would an app help schools?” he said. “Primary schools don’t contain humans with smartphones in the same way as the rest of the world. Certainly, unions should be alert to health risks for the workers they represent, but I don’t think unions should rely on an app to protect their workers. They should make demands that relate to broader tracking and tracing capabilities.”Veale said that an underlying problem in the UK was its failure to conduct enough tests to make tracing work effectively, even with a functioning app available. The first version of the NHS app requires users to self-report symptoms.“We must be careful not to make strong claims about the effectiveness of an app before we have even deployed one,” he said.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has claimed that a nationwide contact-tracing scheme, involving 18,000 contact tracers, will be in place by mid-May. But he has conceded that it is a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity”.The NASUWT teaching union has already called for schools to remain closed until the end of the summer holidays, while the National Association of Head Teachers said it is “clear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school”.A DfE spokesperson said: “Schools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met.“We are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus glance 10 may russia","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Russia has been hit with more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, as the country approaches nearly 200,000 confirmed infections and lockdown measures continue.The country’s coronavirus taskforce confirmed that 104 people had died overnight, bringing the nation’s death toll from the disease to 1,827.On Saturday, the total number of confirmed cases in Russia reached 198,676 after 10,817 new infections were recorded. It is a slightly higher rise than the previous day, when there were 10,699 new cases. Russia’s coronavirus cases overtook France and Germany this week to become the fifth highest total in the world.Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos, could return to lockdown if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules, its governor warned on Saturday.The city emerged on Monday from a five-week stay-at-home order that had left the city’s large number of poor struggling to make ends meet. But since the easing of the restrictions, people have been seen thronging markets and banks despite orders to avoid mass gatherings.Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645.But with Indonesia’s low testing rate criticised by medical experts, the number of infections in the country – which has the fourth biggest population in the world – is feared to be far higher than official figures show.Achmad Yurianto, a health ministry official, said 16 more people had died from the disease, taking the total to 959, while 2,607 had recovered. Nearly 108,700 people had been tested as of Saturday, he added, and he urged Indonesians to continue obeying stay-at-home orders.Germany’s plans to restart competitive football next Saturday suffered an early setback after the entire Dynamo Dresden team were placed in a two-week quarantine following two positive coronavirus tests among the players.The Bundesliga 2 club announced on their website that tests taken on Friday had revealed two new positive cases and local health authorities had ordered the team into quarantine. Dresden were scheduled to play Hannover 96 next Sunday in their first game back following the stoppage caused by the outbreak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba35185cc6ab33071dad86e995f6154abd78a554/0_216_6481_3889/master/6481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d83d45dc4dadab9acd6a4cdad2378a42","title":"coronavirus return to work employment law logistical nightmare","story":"Employers face a logistical nightmare as staff returnTemperature tests, taped-off lifts and potential spikes in harassment complaints are all being examined by British businesses as they prepare for a slow and staggered return to work.Companies have already been scrambling for legal and practical advice as they prepare for the realities of managing workplaces during the Covid-19 crisis. However, there are already major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, while industry figures also warn that the mental health impacts of returning to a new “alien environment” are not being prioritised.Taped squares in lifts, protective screens between workstations and repurposed meeting rooms are among the basic measures being prepared. A wide range of businesses are said to be considering more drastic action, such as the introduction of temperature tests for staff on arrival, according to employment lawyers. Such testing is fraught with potential issues. The enforcement of testing – and recording whether or not a staff member has contracted coronavirus – are areas that could be tested in the courts.An increase in whistleblowing complaints is also likely, as workers see different employers taking varying approaches to the loosening of lockdown – a tension created by differing interpretations of government guidance.Kevin Rowan, the TUC’s head of health and safety, warned that a huge public awareness campaign was needed to ensure workers know their rights.“What is the public information message so that people know what employers are required to do, and that there is somewhere they can go to complain?” he said. “We need to make that more transparent, as well as boosting enforcement.”There are also warnings of a spike in sexual harassment and other harassment allegations as employees readjust to life in the workplace, with some social distancing rules likely to remain in place.A memo composed by a London-based team at the law firm Morgan Lewis warns: “Employers may face a spike in employee misconduct, grievances and litigation as employees adapt to their new workplaces following the long period of isolation. For example, employers may see an increase in sexual harassment issues as employees return to the workplace, and other harassment complaints where employees fail to respect personal space or comply with safety guidelines.”Meanwhile, business groups warn any significant return to work is entirely reliant on the reopening of schools and childcare. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “To say to an employer that schools are going to be open for a couple of year groups on alternate days for a few hours at a time does not solve the problem of getting people back to work.”The government is also being warned that it has to take the psychological impacts of lifting the lockdown as seriously as the logistical difficulties.“We don’t think what we’ve seen so far recognises the emotional impact and anxiety that people will have of what is essentially an alien environment that some people will be returning to,” said David D’Souza, a director at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5746425bc179595f97ad82a622ddd5d9436ca126/0_208_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4fed9d5995ddeaa624d14db70dcfd0bd","title":"food parcels handed out to workers in geneva impacted by covid 19","story":"Over 1,000 poorer working people and undocumented migrants waited for hours for basicsMore than 1,000 people queued on Saturday to get free food parcels in Geneva, underscoring the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the working poor and undocumented immigrants even in wealthy Switzerland.The line of people stretched for more than 1km outside an ice rink where volunteers were handing out about 1,500 parcels to people who started queuing as early as 5am.“At the end of the month, my pockets are empty. We have to pay the bills, the insurance, everything,” said Ingrid Berala, a Geneva resident from Nicaragua who works part-time. “This is great, because there is food for a week, a week of relief … I don’t know for next week.”In a nation of nearly 8.6 million, 660,000 people in Switzerland were poor in 2018, the charity Caritas said, particularly single parents and those with a low level of education unable to find work after losing a job.Swiss bank UBS has calculated that Geneva is the second-most expensive global city for a family of three to live in, behind only Zurich. While average incomes are also high, that helps little for people struggling to make ends meet.“I think a lot people are aware of this, but it is different to see this with your own eyes,” said Silvana Matromatteo, head of the aid group Geneva Solidarity Caravan.“We had people in tears who said, ‘It is not possible that it is happening in my country.’ But it is here and maybe the Covid-19 brought everything out and this is good, because we will be able to take measures to support all these workers, because they are workers above all.”Patrick Wieland, chief of mission for the Doctors Without Borders group, said a survey last week showed just over half the food recipients interviewed were undocumented, while others had attained legal status, were Swiss or were seeking asylum.“In Geneva, one of the richest cities in the world, there have always been people living precariously, especially all the people who work as housekeepers, in agriculture, on construction sites or in hotels, and they found themselves overnight without a job because of Covid-19,” he said.One illegal immigrant who called himself Fernando said he lost his restaurant job during the crisis and had no pay.“I’m very grateful to receive this help and if the situation changes for me, I am committing to do the same thing that they are doing for me,” he said.

And although Spain’s daily death toll continues to fall, its exit plans at present will only allow half of the population living in less badly affected areas to start moving back towards normal life.The growing global economic crisis is particularly acute in places where authorities have few resources to support those who have lost work. In Afghanistan at least seven people were killed and more than a dozen injured when police opened fire on a protest against corruption in food distribution projects.In the US, the worst-hit country in the world, President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that Covid-19 would “go away without a vaccine”, but also said he was expecting 95,000 or more deaths.The latest confirmed case was the US vice-president Mike Pence’s press secretary, who is married to a key Trump aide, anti-immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. That news came the day after Trump’s personal valet tested positive.Globally, Covid-19 has killed more than 275,000 people, and over 3.96 million infections have been confirmed. That total is likely to pass 4 million over the weekend, and does not include many people who have not been able to access testing.Russia registered more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, the sixth in a row at that level. It is now the fifth-worst hit country, approaching nearly 200,000 confirmed infections. However, its death toll of 1,827 is far lower than in European countries with similar numbers of cases, including Italy, the UK, France and Spain.The crisis led the government in Moscow to cancel 9 May celebrations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The festivities would have crowned a historic political season in Russia, including a symbolic referendum to amend Russia’s constitution and reset Putin’s term limits, allowing him to remain in the Kremlin until 2036.Instead Putin is ruling from a bunker, as plummeting oil prices devastate the economy, and the crisis puts his political plans on hold. The day’s festivities were moved mostly online, and a parade replaced by a flypast.VE Day celebrations went ahead in Belarus, where president Alexander Lukashenko appeared to relish upstaging Russia and defying Moscow’s warnings that its lax approach could “bring a sharp increase in the number of those infected”.“Let the parade in Minsk today be the only one in the post-Soviet space,” Lukashenko said. “It will be held in honour of all Soviet fighters who liberated the world from Nazism.”The coronavirus crisis has inflamed US-China relations, with public disputes over the origin and handling of the pandemic exacerbated by other showdowns, including escalating restrictions on and expulsions of foreign journalists.Washington on Friday unveiled new rules that will require Chinese nationals working as journalists for non-US publications to renew their visas every 90 days, after Beijing forced US journalists working for prominent publications to leave China.Tensions are likely to rise further after leaders of the US congressional foreign affairs committee wrote to nearly 60 countries asking them to support Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organization.Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations and is excluded from the WHO because of Chinese objections Beijing considers the self-ruled island a renegade province.It has been seeking to join a ministerial meeting this month of the WHO’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, with backing from Washington and several US allies, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the pandemic.In South Korea, measures to close nightlife venues in Seoul were imposed by mayor Park Won-soon, after 18 new cases were reported in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday, the Associated Press reported.South Korea at one point had the highest number of infections outside mainland China but a comprehensive testing programme and rigorous contact tracing allowed it to bring the virus under control while it proliferated elsewhere. However the latest cases show how easily the virus could re-emerge.South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or KCDC, said all but one of the new cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three clubs in Seoul’s Itaewon district last Saturday before testing positive days later.In total, there have been 40 infections linked to club-goers, mostly in Seoul but also in three other cities. The national government has urged entertainment venues to close or step up anti-virus measures including distancing and temperature checks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fddf4942278eafb03e547007b3cc99f666def5a/64_0_1785_1071/master/1785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce8059d178a7dca7d5bff7646b50444","title":"iran iraq khadimi control middle east suleimani","story":"Rise of spy chief to premier comes as Iran struggles to maintain momentum months after killing of powerful generalIn late February, six weeks after the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani was killed by a US drone, a candidate for Iraq’s vacant premiership was nervously preparing for an interview that would secure him the role.Mustafa al-Kadhimi’s rise from intelligence chief to the seat of national power had been unorthodox, as was the journey he had just made – from Baghdad, where high-stakes appointments like his had mostly been made over the past decade.This time, Kadhimi’s fate was to be decided in another capital, Beirut, where the leader of Lebanon’s Hezbollah was waiting to receive him. Hassan Nasrallah had traditionally focused on affairs closer to home but now found himself thrust to the vanguard of Iran’s interests in the region with a casting vote on who would best represent them.Last week, Kadhimi secured a government, thanks partly to Nasrallah’s endorsement. Yet throughout the horse-trading that eventually secured his cabinet line-up, the gaping hole exposed by Suleimani’s death was evident. “The Iranians and Iraqis are adrift,” said a source with close ties to Iraqi and Hezbollah officials. “The vacuum is as huge as it was when Hajj Qassem was buried.”Such was the void caused by the death of Suleimani – dubbed Hajj Qassem by friend and foe – that nearly all the regional projects that had been under way in his name at the time have faltered. Sources in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in particular suggest that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds Force that projects its core interests, are struggling to maintain momentum.Interviews with Iraqi and Lebanese officials show his replacement, Esmail Ghaani, struggling to assert his authority, even after doing the rounds of Iraq’s power base and the proxy networks that Suleimani had assembled over the 17 years of chaos that followed the US invasion.“He doesn’t speak the language, doesn’t have the history in the region, and – to be fair to him – has been given a mandate that he can’t deliver on,” said an Iraqi official with ties to the country’s national security apparatus. “He was in Afghanistan for 12 years and can’t be expected to know the ways of the Iraqi tribes, or how things have been done here since the Saddam years.”An image of Ghaani getting his beard trimmed during the Iran-Iraq war appeared on Iranian social media earlier this month, in an apparent attempt to make the new Quds Force leader more recognisable. On the same day, perhaps coincidentally, an Iranian publisher announced that Suleimani’s memoirs from the Iran-Iraq war, titled Our Blessed Comrade, would soon be released. Even as Ghaani’s backers tried to personalise him, his slain predecessor was eclipsing him from the grave.In Iran, Suleimani’s role – as intelligence chief, special forces commander and presidential envoy to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – has effectively been broken down. No one is likely to win such broad authority again. Without the weight of Suleimani, the Iranian-backed militia networks established over the past 17 years are proving difficult to manage.As Kadhimi edged closer to the top job, supported also by the US and Saudi Arabia, both of whom saw him as a leader outside of Iran’s grip on Iraq, he ran foul of one of Iraq’s most powerful militias, Kata’ib Hezbollah, which has accused him of facilitating the US operation that killed Suleimani, and their leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, on a Baghdad road in the early hours of 3 January.In a statement issued in early this month, the group said: “During the sensitive times we are going through, the brothers in politics who brought Mustafa al-Kadhimi to be prime minister-designate should know before it’s too late that the man is not up to the responsibility that has been given to him and is still accused of a crime of which he hasn’t been acquitted.”Weeks earlier, Kadhimi had sought a meeting with Keta’ib Hezbollah’s leadership under the auspices of Iraq’s president, where he tried to assure them that he had played no role in the deaths, but left open the possibility that an official in the Iraqi National Intelligence Service might have had contact with US spies.“The informal agreement was that they would not stop him from getting the job, but would continue to talk out against him,” said an official familiar with the conversation.“Kadhimi is facing so much pressure,” said an official connected to the Iraqi presidency. “There are rows between the Shia parties, who don’t see eye-to-eye on a lot. As for the Iranians, of course the loss of Muhandis and Qassem was a major blow they’re rearranging their structures now. But have they lost control? Not at all, the proof is their meddling in the formation.”With Kadhimi now Iraq’s premier decision-maker, US and Saudi officials are privately hailing a new era of Iraqi sovereignty. Washington pushed its allies in the country’s Kurdish north and Sunni centre to endorse him. “They think they’ve got their man,” a regional official said. “They’re celebrating. When will they ever understand Iraq?”Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13531d95e5e393ccaedcf926606d1b5188f21e05/0_132_4904_2943/master/4904.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=52fc9b179a2fa125ef2113c2ce08c2b2","title":"pms plan to ease uk lockdown likely to be in line with wales","story":"Modest changes expected to include relaxing exercise rules and reopening garden centresBoris Johnson’s plans to ease the UK lockdown are likely to be in line with Wales, which would result in only modest changes such as the reopening of garden centres and libraries, and a relaxation of exercise rules, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday.Drakeford said the prime minister’s announcement for England would be in line with the very smallest easing granted in Wales.The first minister said the transmission rate allowed only a very modest easing to permit more than one form of exercise per day, and for garden centres and libraries to reopen. “My view is we’ll be very much in line with one another,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“Our new regime won’t come in until Monday, so we’ll move in a timely way together across the UK and I still think that is very much a preferable route.”Schools in Wales will not reopen to the majority of pupils until June, he added.Johnson is expected to take a cautious approach on Sunday, with official figures putting the UK death toll at more than 36,000. Plans to quarantine people entering the UK for 14 days and a move to building extra cycle lanes have also been leaked.Johnson is expected to say garden centres can reopen from Wednesday as long as social distancing measures can be enforced.The move will be welcomed by an industry devastated by the economic shutdown during its prime trading season. Retailers are preparing for a surge in plant and flower sales, which could help salvage a catastrophic year.Research for the Horticultural Trades Association last month found that, even with help in form of financial aid packages, a third of businesses are likely to be insolvent by the end of the year.Store owners will be responsible for ensuring social distancing rules are adhered to by shoppers, who will have to keep a distance of two metres from others. It is likely that shoppers will only be allowed to enter centres in controlled numbers, a policy already in place in supermarkets.Cleaning stations for baskets and trolleys, outdoor queuing systems and one-way aisles could limit contact between customers and staff. Perspex screens installed at staffed tills and self-checkouts could also help garden centres implement the required distancing restrictions.Cafes or playgrounds that are part of the stores will not be able to reopen.Although many of Britain’s 23 million gardeners will be delighted by the news, others have questioned whether garden centres should be given priority while many other parts of life remain under lockdown.A senior government source told PA Media: “Garden centres typically open large open-air spaces where the risk of transmission of coronavirus is lower. With strict social distancing measures in place we believe they can open safely from next week.”While allowing garden centres to reopen is part of measures that aim to gradually revive the economy, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said at the daily briefing on Friday expectations about a wholesale lifting of lockdown restrictions were misplaced. He stated that there “isn’t going to be any dramatic overnight change”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e0ed230c2c8d0fb247b08f97c81df26df41a182/0_320_6652_3991/master/6652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=592a71eb2521ff8929d07807d1d08252","title":"uk coastguard urges people to stay home amid increase in distress calls coronavirus","story":"Meanwhile police in London say they’re ‘losing the battle’ as people gather in parks despite coronavirus lockdownThe coastguard has urged the public not to ignore the government’s stay-at-home message after recording its highest number of distress calls in a single day since the lockdown began.The rescue service said it dealt with 97 incidents on Friday, more than one and a half times the daily average over the previous month.Matt Leat, the coastguard’s duty commander, said: “I completely understand that the weather and the bank holiday coupled with the fact that we’ve been in this lockdown situation for just over six weeks has tempted people out to our beautiful coasts. However, as the government said only yesterday, it’s really vital that we all continue to observe the guidance.”He said the coastguard would always respond to a 999 or distress call, but he reminded those who were breaking lockdown rules that every rescue put frontline responders at risk and the NHS under avoidable pressure.“Please, please continue to observe the #StayHomeSaveLives message – it’s still in place for a reason.

Few were wearing masks.“This year, let the military parade in Minsk be the only one in the post-Soviet space,” boasted Alexander Lukashenko, the country’s president, who has publicly downplayed the dangers from the pandemic. The country has more than 22,000 cases of the disease and has recorded 126 deaths.He appeared to relish upstaging Moscow’s celebrations.“In this insane, disoriented world, there will be people who condemn us for the time and place of this sacred act,” he said defiantly. “Don’t rush to conclusions or condemn us, descendants of the victory of Belarusians. We couldn’t have acted differently. We had no other choice. And even if we had one, we would have done the same.”In Russia, however, where the tally of coronavirus infections on Saturday approached 200,000, and the capital’s climbed past 100,000, they chose to do it differently.City authorities in Moscow were desperate for people to stay at home, with police detaining several activists with flags marking the holiday at Pushkin Square.Vladimir Putin appeared in an overcast Moscow for the first time in more than a month to lay a bouquet of red roses at the Eternal Flame and vow to hold the parade as soon as possible. “We will, as usual, celebrate the anniversary widely and solemnly, and we will do it with dignity, as is our duty to those who suffered and achieved this victory,” he said. He was accompanied by a guard of honour and observed an airforce flypast, the only element of the military parade preserved this year.Elsewhere some of the most committed got creative. Volunteers in Novosibirsk climbed cherry-pickers to sing war ballads to veterans on their balconies. News programmes urged families to mount images of veterans on their windows and take part in a national moment of silence at 7pm, followed by a rendition of the song Victory Day from their balconies. The authorities hope an array of online concerts, digital museum tours and popular war films on TV will keep Russians occupied and off the streets.When all else fails, there are always reruns. A sports channels played repeats of Russia’s victories at a recent hockey tournament. And as soon as Putin finished his short visit to the Eternal Flame, the state television channel flipped over to footage of troops, tanks and other military hardware rolling across Red Square to mark the holiday in years past."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4249586.1589032790!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert teachers seek safeguards against parental pressure on grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh announced on Friday that the State exams will not go ahead this summer for the first time in almost 100 years. Photograph: iStockOne of the country’s biggest teachers’ unions is calling for clear “safeguards” to prevent pressure being applied to teachers from parents over Leaving Cert calculated grades.Minister for Education Joe McHugh announced on Friday that the State exams will not go ahead this summer for the first time in almost 100 years as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.Instead, students will have the option of receiving grades calculated by their teachers based on their school work or going on to sit written exams in late 2020 or early 2021, subject to public health advice. Following the announcement, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) has called for “safeguards to ensure that the professional integrity of teachers is protected” under the new system. John MacGabhann, TUI general secretary, said guidelines were needed about what would constitute iniduals, such as parents, attempting to compromise the process of calculating a student’s grades. “There needs to be a clear sign that any form of pressure is simply inappropriate and won’t work,” he told The .This would include “benign” or “soft” efforts to influence teachers, and the Department of Education needed to clearly set out what would constitute parents “overstepping”, he said. Guidelines on how the calculated grade system will work state that teachers “must not under any circumstances discuss with any student, or with the parents or s of any student, the estimated marks that the school is submitting”.The guidelines state that allowing discussion would “interfere” with the process being carried out “properly and fairly”.ApprovalFollowing a meeting on Friday the TUI executive committee approved engaging with the calculated grades system.In a statement, the union said students “have a right to advance to the next stage of their lives”, and needed a “mechanism” to allow them to do this without the traditional exams. “Implementation of these measures on an emergency basis will not and cannot be regarded as a precedent or as agreement to operate such measures in future years,” the statement said. The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) executive body met on Friday evening and is continuing discussion of the plans on Saturday. Sources said that while there were deep reservations about the plans, there was also a recognition that there was no viable alternative.School principals, meanwhile, said they were prepared to support the move given that there was no “perfect solution” to the situation, while students’ representatives said the move finally gave exam candidates much-needed clarity.The Government is concerned over its exposure to legal action by students who may miss out on college places following the decision to replace the Leaving Cert with the system of calculated grades.Mr McHugh has admitted there are “legal vulnerabilities” with the new plan, while the Attorney General is understood to have briefed Ministers on areas of concern in relation to it.These are understood to relate to students’ legitimate expectations to be able to sit an exam, as well as their right to take up a college place after sitting the Leaving Cert.College placesUnder the plan, students who undertake the written exams will not be able to take up their college places in the coming academic year and will have to wait until the following year.Labour Party education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin has called on the Government to publish both the legal and public health advice behind the decision to cancel the previously scheduled written exams. “There are several legal issues outstanding with the Government’s decision on the Leaving Certificate,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said on Saturday. It was “unclear” if the calculated grade system would meet legal requirements, he said. “Students need to be assured that their results of Leaving Cert 2020 will have exactly the same status as previous years,” he said. Mr McHugh needed to publish the legal advice given to Government on the decision “so we can be absolutely assured that the legal criteria is indeed satisfied”, he said. “I think it would be beneficial for the Government to publish the health advice they received on cancelling the exams. It will give schools a greater insight into how they can expect to open schools in late August as per the Government’s roadmap,” Mr Ó Ríordáin said.How ‘calculated grades’ will work:1. Teachers will be asked to provide a professional judgment of student’s likely Leaving Cert grades based on their work completed in school over the past three years.2. The school principal will approve the estimated scores provided and the rankings of each student in each subject in the school.3. A special unit is being established within the Department of Education to process the data provided by each school and operate “national standardisation” to ensure fairness among all students.4. The Department of Education will finalise the grades for each student, which will be as close as possible to the traditional results date in mid-August. Formal State certification will also be provided."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241807.1588238327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"does it matter whether my plants listen to mozart or bach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwinging back the polytunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. Illustration: Michael VineyMy painting below shows the polytunnel, with attendant gardener, in another good summer years ago. I’m still down there soon after breakfast, carrying the radio for Lyric, to tend a rather less ambitious vegetable array.As always, swinging back the tunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. On further inspection, I may murmur some encouragement to a row of climbing beans, praise the mangetout vines for their first purple flowers and the Russian tomatoes for their yellow ones.The streak of animism that tempers my appetite for science allows an amiable connection with plants I have raised from seeds. This lent some fellow feeling with Prince Charles when, years ago, he confided that he always talked to plants in his greenhouses, adding that it was “very important – they respond”.His incautious remarks came in the wake of an American book, The Secret Life of Plants (1973), which offered “the physical, emotional and spiritual relations between plants and man”. Mixing legitimate science on plant senses and behaviour with subjective experiment and spiritual folklore, it achieved a heady readability that earned much media praise and a considerable nod from public culture.Scientists seeking acceptance of the new view of plants met much sceptical reaction that jeopardised funding for their work. With the book’s authors now dead (neither of them were scientists), the popular case for plant senses and intelligence now has impeccable champions.From Israel, for example, plant geneticist Daniel Chamovitz offered What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses of Your Garden and Beyond (2012), of which a generous list is online as a PDF. It persuaded me that whether Lyric plays Mozart or Bach to my polytunnel plants, they are probably deaf to either. Even talking to them just offers a fleeting, if benevolent, breath of CO2.At Chamovitz’s Tel Aviv University, on the other hand, new experiments described by Itzhak Keit show that tomato and tobacco plants stressed by drought or being cut emit ultrasonic airborne sounds detectable several metres away. If the pinching out of shoots from the oxters of my tomatoes elicits squeals of protest, I am mercifully unable to hear them.Plant intelligence rests in the demonstrable awareness and responses by which they solve their problems. Rooted they may be, but hardly static, as the many online time-lapse films of growth – the ballet of seedling beans, the thrust of elongating briars – make enchantingly clear.If they show no special taste in music, they may indeed recoil from its vibrations. They hear approaching insects and react to the munching of caterpillars by flooding leaves with deterrent chemicals. They smell such signals of alarm released by their neighbours.This is now established in plant science, much of it easily accessible online. It readily bows to the early work of Charles Darwin among the pots of plants in his study: runner beans, cucumbers, nasturtiums, hops anything that climbed and moved.Darwin worked with son Francis to study the cellular search-and-curl movement (they called it “circumnutation”) of climbers twirling up poles. As Francis told a science assembly in Dublin: “We must believe that in plants there exists a faint copy of what we know as consciousness in ourselves.” This has developed into today’s “plant neurobiology”, a term disparaged by those scientists who save anything “neuro” for the human brain and its neurons.It was the Darwins, in their book The Power of Movement in Plants, who proposed that the tiny tip of the embryo root, first to emerge from the seed, “acts like the brain of one of the lower animals”. Its sensitivity, multiplied at the tips of branching roots, serves as a network of perception and command that guides their navigation through the soil.Richard Karban in the US and Anthony Trewavas in Scotland are two more of today’s notable scientists absorbed with plant intelligence. But the most vigorous and prolific proponent of the “root-brain hypothesis” is Italy’s Prof Stefano Mancuso at Florence University. Of his lectures on YouTube, “The roots of plant intelligence” in the Ted series is a specially engaging.Along with scientific enlightenment comes Mancuso’s challenge to human habits in viewing the life of the planet. Some 99 per cent of Earth’s biomass, as he argues, is that of plants, yet humans have ignored their intricate networks of consciousness, granting active intelligence only to an animal brain.In a corner of the polytunnel, a chair is propped in a bank of fading wallflowers, next to the early potatoes. I rest there, circled by bumblebees, to ponder such reproaches to human history. Our tight co-evolution and reliance on plants, Mancuso observed recently, “might raise the question of who actually domesticated whom”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4249631.1589046926!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hottest day of the year so far as temperatures reach 23 6 degrees in mayo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople enjoy the sun at Dollymount, Dublin, on Saturday.

Photograph: Giuseppe  LamiEPACoronavirus has infected more than 4 million people and killed more than 270,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University based on official data.Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 pandemic from around the world:EuropeSpain’s daily death toll from the coronavirus fell to its second-lowest figure since mid-March on Saturday, as half the country prepared to move to the next phase of an exit from one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns.Spain began to loosen its lockdown this week, but its move to Phase 1 will include a considerable easing of measures that will allow people to move around their province as well as attend concerts and go to the theatre. Gatherings of up to 10 people will also be allowed. The country’s daily death toll from the coronavirus fell to 179 on Saturday, down from 229 the previous day and a fraction of the highs above 900 seen in early April. The cumulative death total rose to 26,478, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 223,578 from 222,857 the day before, the health ministry said.“We’ve managed to retake 99 per cent of the ground lost to the virus,” said prime minister Pedro Sánchez in a televised address on Saturday. But he warned people moving to Phase 1 to be “prudent” and “cautious”. Some 51 per cent of the population will progress to Phase 1 of a four-step easing plan on Monday after the government decided the regions in which they lived met the necessary criteria.In regions that made the cut, such as the Canary and Balearic Islands, bars, restaurants and shops will open at reduced capacity, and museums, gyms and hotels will open their doors for the first time in nearly two months. The country’s two biggest cities – Madrid and Barcelona – do not currently meet the criteria for easing and will remain on Phase 0.Meanwhile, deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 194 on Saturday, against 243 new deaths the day before, the country’s Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases fell to 1,083 from 1,327 on Friday.The total Italian death toll since the outbreak came to light in the country on February 21st now stands at 30,395, the agency said, the third highest in the world after the US and the UK. The number of confirmed cases in Italy amounts to 218,268 – the third-highest such tally in the world behind those of the US and Spain.The agency said 1.645 million people in Italy had now been tested for the virus, against 1.609 million on Friday, out of a population of about 60 million.The number of people who have died from coronavirus infections in France rose by 80 to 26,310 on Saturday, the French health ministry said, a much smaller daily increase than in the previous day, when it was 243. The ministry said the number of people in intensive care units fell by 56, or about 2 per cent, to 2,812. That is less than half the peak of 7,148 seen on April 8th.France will start lifting its almost two-month-old national lockdown from Monday.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has increased by 1,251 to 168,551, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The reported death toll rose by 147 to 7,369, the tally showed. Germany’s plans to restart competitive soccer on May 16th suffered an early setback after the entire team of second-tier Dynamo Dresden were placed in a two-week quarantine following two positive coronavirus tests.Slovakia on Friday recorded no new cases of coronavirus for the first time since March 10th, government figures showed.Russia reported more than 10,000 new cases of coronavirus for a seventh straight day, including more than 80 at its biggest gold mine.Belarus defied worries about the pandemic to hold a parade marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazis, with thousands of people in attendance, including elderly veterans.UKThe UK death toll has risen by 346 to 31,587 across all settings, while a total of 215,260 people have now tested positive for Covid-19, an increase of 3,896 cases on Friday.The British government is set to announce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travellers into Britain as part of measures aimed at avoiding a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, it has been reported.The London Times says that British prime minister Boris Johnson will make the announcement in an address to the nation on Sunday.Under the measures, which are expected to be implemented in June, all passengers arriving at airports and ports will be required to provide an address at which they will immediately self-isolate for 14 days.However, it says travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will be exempt from the quarantine.The paper reports that “authorities will conduct spot checks”, with punishments for those not adhering to the rules, including “fines of up to £1,000” and deportation.At a daily briefing on Saturday, transport minister Grant Shapps said that Mr Johnson will proceed with “extreme caution” in easing the lockdown, and warned the public not to “throw away” their hard work by going outside.USA day after the White House confirmed that US president Donald Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for the virus, Mr Trump told reporters that Katie Miller, press secretary to US vice-president Mike Pence, had also been infected. She is married to senior Trump aide and immigration policy hardliner Stephen Miller, and travels frequently with Mr Pence. The back-to-back diagnoses of iniduals close to Mr Trump, Mr Pence and the White House inner circle raised questions about whether the highest levels of government are adequately safeguarded from infection. “We’ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,” White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters.More than 77,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, out of more than 1.29 million confirmed cases, according to a Reuters tally.New York, seen as the centre of the US’s epidemic, has reported the fewest new coronavirus cases in seven weeks.ChinaChina will reform its disease prevention and control system to address weaknesses exposed by the coronavirus outbreak, a senior Chinese health official said on Saturday.China has been criticised domestically and abroad as being initially slow to react to the virus, which first broke out on a large scale in Wuhan.“This coronavirus epidemic is a big test of our country’s governance and governing ability, and it exposed the weak links in how we address major epidemic and public health systems,” Li Bin, vice-minister of the China National Health Commission, told reporters.The commission intends to build a “centralised and efficient” chain of command, and modernise the disease prevention and control system, he said. The commission also aims to make better use of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better analyse the disease, trace the virus and distribute resources. China has not seen any new deaths from coronavirus for 24 days.China is willing to offer support to North Korea against coronavirus, state television said on Saturday, quoting a letter from president Xi Jinping to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.South KoreaSeoul has shut down more than 2,100 nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after dozens of coronavirus infections were linked to clubgoers who went out last weekend as South Korea relaxed social distancing guidelines. The measures imposed by mayor Park Won-soon came after the national government urged entertainment venues around the nation to close or enforce anti-virus measures, including distancing, temperature checks, keeping customer lists and requiring employees to wear masks.Officials reported 18 fresh cases of coronavirus in 24 hours, including 12 in the capital Seoul, as health workers scramble to trace contacts after detecting a slew of transmissions linked to clubgoers.Figures released by South Korea’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Saturday brought national totals to 10,840 cases and 256 deaths.Officials said they detected at least 15 infections linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three clubs last Saturday before testing positive on Wednesday.The infections raised concern about a broader spread of the virus in the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.Rest of the worldCovid-19 could kill between 83,000 and 190,000 people in Africa in the first year if it is not contained, the World Health Organisation has said.More than 500 workers at an industrial facility in Ghana have tested positive for coronavirus, the country’s health service said on Friday. The overall number of cases in Ghana rose on Friday to 4,012, including 18 deaths, from 3,091 on Thursday.Brazil has surpassed the UK in fatalities, and infections there have tripled in the past two weeks, as officials warned the numbers are likely higher given the low level of testing. British medical journal The Lancet called president Jair Bolsonaro the biggest threat to Brazil’s ability to successfully combat the spread of coronavirus and tackle the unfolding public health crisis.At least six people were killed when protesters angry over what they see as unfair food aid distribution during the pandemic clashed with police in Afghanistan’s western Ghor province on Saturday, according to officials. – PAReutersBloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"end lockdown timetable when shops public transport offices reopen","story":"Boris Johnson is planning to address the nation again on Sunday at 7pm, when he will set out an exit plan for how Britain will gradually leave lockdown.While details of \u0027phase two\u0027 of Britain\u0027s response to the coronavirus pandemic will only be made public at the end of this weekend, there are already some indications of how different elements of society are set to reopen.Guidance is expected to be issued by the Government on how shops can reopen safely, which would include physical distancing measures and could also extend to separate exits and entrances.All stores deemed \u0027non-essential\u0027 were ordered to close when lockdown measures came into effect on March 23. These included clothing shops, bookstores, hairdressers, bed and breakfasts, and indoor and outdoor markets.Shops that have been exempt from the Government\u0027s ban are food retailers, pharmacies, hardware stores, corner shops, petrol stations, shops in hospitals, post offices, banks, newsagents, launderettes, and pet shops.Garden centres are to open next week, the Prime Minister is expected to announce. The centres will be allowed to open their doors on Wednesday while still abiding by social distancing rules.The hardware business B\u0026ampQ, which was deemed an essential retailer, last month reopened 75 of its stores after plans were agreed to safeguard customers and staff.The measures adopted by B\u0026ampQ offer some indication on the guidelines that will be issued across the sector, including strict limits of the numbers of customers in a store at any given time, designated queuing areas, and two-metre markers in order to remind customers of the need for social distancing.The British Retail Consortium has compiled a set of suggested rules which include having extra barriers, encouraging customers to shop alone, keeping changing rooms closed, and the use of protective screens at the tills.Brands are also considering introducing sanitation stations and even portable sinks, so  that people can wash their hands when they enter a store. Alex Baldock, the Dixons Carphone boss, has devised zero-contact stores, which will have drive-through-style pickup points for goods. The British Retail Consortium has submitted a report to Government recommending that if non-essential shops reopen, changing rooms should stay closed and in-store seating and services – such as advice, personal shopping or nail bars – should be limited.Retailers and unions have put aside long-standing differences to join forces, with the intention of restarting the retail sector as soon as possible without threats of industrial action.John Lewis, the department store chain, is due to open some of its stores from mid-May, while Associated British Foods - the boss of Primark’s owner - said notice of between two and four weeks will be required to help the industry get up and running again.Retailers that are currently trading have taken measures outside and inside stores, introducing plexiglass screens at tills and limiting numbers both in store and in socially-distanced warehousing operations.A glimpse of the \u0027new normal\u0027 for working in offices is given by seven separate government documents obtained by this newspaper which give draft guidelines for opening shopping centres, hotels, factories, and offices.Recommendations for offices include plexiglass screens being installed between desks and the requirement for workers to sit back-to-back or side-to-side, rather than face-to-face. The Prime Minister is also set to announce that companies will be asked to provide face coverings for staff who are required back at work.The documents also stipulate that lifts should be half-empty, hot-desking is to be abolished for the foreseeable future, and the sharing of equipment such as pens and staplers will be banned.Employees will still be encouraged to work from home if this is possible, with employers expected to have regular communication with workers about their mental and physical wellbeing. In fact, Britons could be given a legal right to work from home to ensure that they are not forced to go back to workplaces after the lockdown under plans being considered in Whitehall.For those who do come into the workplace, the nine-to-five work day will end for the foreseeable future, as employers stagger arrival and departure times to reduce crowding.Office spaces are set to be reconfigured to enable adequate social distancing, with screens and floor markings used to ensure that staff stay two metres apart from one another.The document urges employers to continue to carry out meetings remotely where possible, as well as providing additional entry points, plus extra parking and bike-raking facilities to discourage the use of public transport.New rules as Italians have gone back to work have sparked confusion and frustration, which bosses will be keen to avoid as Britain gradually reopens for business.Public transport capacity and usage has been severely reduced throughout the lockdown. The London Underground has been operating a reduced service, with 40 Underground stations closing which do not sit on the intersections of Tube lines, and the Night Tube service was suspended on March 19 before the full lockdown came into place.“London will get through these extraordinarily challenging times and ensuring the capital’s critical workers can move around the city will be crucial,” said Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.Mr Johnson is expected to issue more guidance on face coverings after a survey by the rail and road watchdog, Transport Focus, found that more than half of commuters (51 per cent) would not be happy using trains and buses again unless the Government mandated the wearing of face masks.In a poll of 2,000 passengers, carried out earlier this month, 83 per cent of passengers said they also wanted hand sanitiser made available on vehicles as well as train stations and bus stops, and 62 percent said they would not venture back onto public transport unless effective social-distancing measures are in place.The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Saturday (9 May) announced a £2 billion package to increase cycling and walking capacity across the United Kingdom, a response to the new difficulties that commuters will face getting to work during the pandemic.The programme will be published early next month and aims to double the amount of people cycling by 2025, while also encouraging more people walking to work.Measures announced include pop-up bike lines, wider pavements, and streets that will exclusively be for the use of bicycles and buses.“Whilst it’s crucial that we stay at home, when the country does get back to work we need to ask those people to carry on cycling or walking and for them to be joined by many others as well,” Mr Shapps said.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that masks are currently being stockpiled for use by the public, and that face coverings on public transport could be encouraged in order to reassure the public that it is safe to go back to work. Masks and distancing measures are two of the measures that could be made compulsory on public transport.British Transport Police may need to maintain a presence at station entrances to ensure crowd control and social distancing at the busiest times, while companies are likely to have to stagger their working days to avoid a single rush hour.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has suggested that the use of public transport during peak time should be discouraged, in order to reduce congestion and lessen the risk of infection spreading.Examples would be to increase the relative price of commuting at peak times on the London tube and bus network, or to suspend the London congestion charge for drivers, it said.As things stand, pubs and restaurants - with the exception of restaurants which are currently operating solely in a takeaway capacity - will be among the last spaces to reopen.It is not currently possible when this will be, but industry estimates range from July through to winter or even early 2021.Restrictive measures on reopening are likely to include fewer tables, limits on customer numbers, shortened opening hours, more local produce, and restricted menus.Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: Currently there is no clear indication as to when pubs will be able to open again. As it stands, the Government guidance is clear and pubs will continue to adhere to that.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside story britain developed contact tracing app 9 years ago","story":"Britain invented a contact-tracing app nine years ago, it has emerged as the Cambridge professor who built it has said the Government “missed an opportunity” to develop the life-saving technology.Jon Crowcroft, from Cambridge University’s Computer Laboratory, said the UK could have been “10 years ahead of the curve rather than three months behind it” if it had capitalised on the FluPhone app, which was an early prototype of the contact-tracing technology the NHS is now scrambling build to curb coronavirus infections after lockdown.However, his team’s successful efforts building the app fell by the wayside in 2011 as funding ran dry. Senior health ministers at the time have told The  that news of the technology never reached their desks - even as they drew up plans for a flu pandemic.Meanwhile, senior Whitehall sources said that despite the UK’s technical capabilities, a contact-tracing app was not “on the radar” of Government pandemic planners even in recent years.An omission that sources have described as “a mistake”, as other countries, especially in Asia, have managed to avoid high death tolls and severe lockdowns by rapidly testing and contact-tracing early on in the pandemic.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce lockdown measures will start to be eased from Monday, the Government’s ‘test, track and trace’ strategy is still not up and running.The pilot scheme, which ministers hope will help suppress a second peak of infections, only launched fully on the Isle of Wight on Thursday, when the NHS Covid-19 App became available to islanders.The app uses smartphones’ Bluetooth connections to log when people come into close contact. Then when someone reports Covid-19 symptoms in the app it sends a notification to all those deemed to have had ‘high risk’ contact, advising them to self isolate for two weeks. The infected person will then be sent a viral swab test and if it comes back positive, Public Health England workers will follow up to trace contacts who may not have been using the app. Hours after the app went live, residents complained of problems saying it was not compatible with new Android phones or that they were being bombarded with notifications. Then, this week, it emerged that the NHS has instructed one the companies developing the app, Zuhlke, to explore the ‘feasibility’ of switching to the model being designed by Apple and Google, a move that could lead to further delays for the app’s rollout. The NHS said today that it still intends to roll out the app to the nation by ‘mid May’.Yet, as the UK and other western countries scramble to get test, track and trace operational, others such as South Korea have been lauded as exemplars of the system.Informed by the experience of previous serious outbreaks such as SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012, the country developed an advanced digital and human contact-tracing infrastructure. When the first cases were reported, South Korea was able to mass test and trace infections digitally using phones’ GPS signals and also records of citizens\u0027 purchase history. So far the peninsula country has reported just over 250 deaths from coronavirus, while the UK’s has surged over 30,000 this week.While South Korea’s digital contact-tracing efforts were well in train before the virus, last month it emerged that NHSX, the health service’s digital arm, only started building the UK’s contact-tracing app on March 7 - just over two weeks before the lockdown was imposed.One of the people NHS developers turned to as they started to look at building the app earlier this year was Prof. Crowcroft. He was asked for the source code for the app FluPhone that was developed by his team in 2011. The app’s inception came about during the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic of 2009, after which Prof. Crowcroft was approached by epidemiologies intrigued by his work looking at how Bluetooth signals on phones could be used to track people’s movements.A team of leading epidemiologists, behaviour psychologists and developers then won a grant from the Medical Research Council to build the app and test it with volunteers from Cambridge University.A three month trial showed the technology could be used to track the spread of a simulated disease. Although, researchers found it difficult to persuade volunteers to agree to being traced and fewer than a 100 volunteers ever took part. But the concept was proved and in 2011 the UK was one of, if not the first country, to have developed a Bluetooth contact-tracing app. The NHS was also aware of the project as the team worked directly with Health Protection Agency officials at the time. Prof. Crowcroft said that after the initial grant ran out the team was unable to maintain or develop the app further and it fell into disrepair. He said: I think it is a missed opportunity (not continuing to develop the technology).“The gap is a shame as we could have been 10 years ahead of the curve rather than about three months behind it.”The Cambridge Professor said that the tale of FluPhone was an indictment of the UK’s failure to capitalise on its technological innovation.He added: “This sad tale of the British Isles repeatedly making up new stuff - we had the first civilian jet airliner, the first hovercraft - but someone else says ‘that’s a good idea, we’ll do version two of that.”One of the other academics who worked on the project is leading epidemiologist, Prof. John Edmunds OBE, who now sits on the influential Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) committee advising the Government on how to navigate the coronavirus crisis.He said he was skeptical at the time that the technology could be used to contain an epidemic.This was because back 2011 Bluetooth tracking was unreliable and picked up people five and 10 meters away, even those in different offices who had had no contact.In the years since, Prof. Edmunds said the Government’s focus has been planning for a flu pandemic, where infections happen in the first two days, compared to Coronavirus where transmission can happen over up to seven days.This longer infection time opens a window for rapid digital contract-tracing to disrupt the spread of Coronavirus, rather than in flu pandemics, where contract-tracing is seen as a way merely to buy time to prepare the health service.A study by Oxford University in April found that if 56 percent of the UK downloaded an effective contact-tracing app and followed its advice, transmission of coronavirus would be stopped dead, even before a vaccine or cure is found.Prof. Edmunds, added: “Our pandemic planning was based on flu as we knew a flu pandemic would come. You can criticise that in retrospect. “Can you tell me what the next pandemic will be? No, you can’t. But I can tell you there will be a flu one.”His assessment is shared by Andrew Lansley, the former Health Secretary who was in office when FluPhone was developed. He told The  that at the time the Department for Health was focused on drawing up Britain’s Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy, but that digital contact-tracing did not come up in those discussions and he has no recollection of hearing about the app.However, he said he felt the West’s relatively slow response to the current pandemic was because of its focus on influenza rather than the possibility of a novel coronavirus.Lord Lansley said: “We are behind Asian countries (in our response to coronavirus) as they developed it in relation to the experience of SARS and MERS. “If there is a general issue that Western Countries have to confront, it is why did they think that because SARS and MERS were contained in Asia that every coronavirus would be contained in Asia, because it didn’t happen that way.“It is human nature, people are fighting the last war and not releasing the next one needs different technology.” Lord Lansley’s minister for public health at the time, Anne Milton, a former nurse, said she also did not recall hearing of FluPhone during her tenure.She said she felt part of the issue was an institutional slowness of the NHS to adopt new technology. “With hindsight, it does feel like there was a missed opportunity,” said Ms Milton“There is a slowness of the NHS and healthcare to use modern IT. Maybe this is an institutional problem.”Yet, even in the Government’s more recent pandemic planning, digital contact-tracing appears to have played little part.As late as 2016 a cross departmental pandemic simulation, codenamed Exercise Cygnus, found the UK unprepared for a pandemic and that the NHS would be quickly overwhelmed in the event of one sweeping the UK.A senior Whitehall source involved in drawing up the UK’s pandemic plans admitted officials had failed to explore ways to use tech to suppress the spread of a new disease.“It wasn’t on our radar,” the source said. “We were ploughing our own furrow, and discussions about using contact tracing apps never really took place at a senior level. We always thought a flu outbreak would be the next disease coming down the track, and contact tracing wasn’t a major part of that conversation. “Clearly looking back, that was a mistake. We certainly had the expertise, and we could have had the technology ready to go as we’ve seen in other countries.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our goal is to protect the NHS and save lives – and the NHS COVID-19 app is a key part of our plans to track the virus and keep people safe.“Our response to the coronavirus has been led by the best scientific advice, and the app has been developed in line with the latest expert guidance.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal albert hall facing closure social distancing rules put","story":"Since Queen Victoria first opened its doors, the Royal Albert Hall has been a jewel in the British cultural crown. But the historic home of the Proms now faces closure in a “tragedy for the nation” as Covid-19 rules will make it impossible to operate safely and still stay afloat.The Royal Albert Hall will be unable to operate under impractical social distancing after lockdown has lifted, its chief executive has revealed. This jeopardises the future of the venue, and the cherished annual Proms concerts which have been performed there since the Second World War. Mr Hassal said suggestions that the Proms could be played to an empty hall and streamed online are impractical.Ensuring that ticket-holders remain two metres apart will require venues to drastically cut capacity while keeping bars and restaurants closed - a recipe for financial disaster, according to Craig Hassal, chief executive of the 150-year-old venue.“If Government says, ‘You can reopen but these are the guidelines’, we can’t reopen,” Mr Hassal told the Sunday .The venue is in a “seriously desperate” situation and needs a swift return to normal capacity in order to stay afloat, Mr Hassal said.Describing the prospect as an “absolute tragedy for the nation”, he said:  “We may have to close.“If we can’t make this work, we don\u0027t have a secret stash of money.  We’re digging into our reserves now.“The biggest risk is that we would close down.  You can’t imagine the Royal Albert Hall being forced to close, it’s unthinkable.”Last month, the BBC insisted it will press ahead with this year’s Prom, due to begin on July 17, in some form. Suggested options include streaming concerts from an empty Royal Albert Hall.But Mr Hassal said he believed that to be unworkable. He disclosed that Katherine Jenkins’ performance from the venue to mark VE Day entailed a five-day shoot and a large crew for less than an hour of entertainment.Shows for May and June have been cancelled, including performances by Peter Frampton, Scouting for Girls and English National Ballet’s Swan Lake, plus popular orchestral performances of the soundtracks from Titanic and Terminator.Artists who have concerts scheduled for the coming months include Russell Watson, James Blunt, George Benson and Cliff Richard.Mr Hassal said social distance modelling - working out how many people the venue can safely hold if they adhere to the two-metre rule - dropped the capacity of the 5,000-seater venue down to just 30 per cent.This rules out charitable events like the Teenage Cancer Trust shows, and even the premiere of the latest James Bond film No Time To Die. Such low capacity would immediately put off any of the promoters the Royal Albert Hall works with, as the tickets sales would be a fraction of what is budgeted for.There are also practicalities, including the need to do away with intervals as they would lead to audiences heading for doorways and Narrow corridors at the same time. “We didn’t have a solution for how to manage the toilets, how you go to the loo,” Mr Hassal added.The institution has no shareholders and does not get the regular government funding enjoyed by other cultural attractions, a problem it shares with the Royal Academy,  Old Vic and Shakepeare’s Globe.Mr Hassal said: “We are on the brink of a massive problem for the cultural sector, and we haven’t really come to grips with that yet.  We need clarity from the Government.” A spokeswoman for the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport said As soon as it is safe to do so, we will be encouraging everyone to visit the UK\u0027s vibrant performing arts venues.“The Government has announced unprecedented financial measures and we encourage all eligible arts organisations to apply for the support available to them.Other cultural venues are weighing up whether or not they can stage events while adhering to social distancing.At the Royal Festival Hall, the two-metre rule would mean allowing only 800 people to sit in the 2,700-seat auditorium.

It has experienced minimal community spread and most cases have been imported from abroad.As a result, its cyber experts have had months to create two voluntary tracing apps – one for border control and health checks using GPS and one for social distancing using Bluetooth - but have not yet needed to launch them, explained Mr Jyan. They have been designed along the lines of the methods Taiwan has relied on so far - the less precise, but less invasive use of phone location data, working alongside five national telecoms companies. When the first inkling of a mystery respiratory illness emerged from China in December, Taiwan acted fast to monitor the health of incoming travellers and control its borders, gradually phasing in 14-day home quarantine firstly for arrivals from China and adding other countries as the virus spread. Compulsory quarantine for inbound passengers – a move resisted so far by the UK but which may be adopted this weekend – has been a vital first line of defence in Taiwan’s pandemic response strategy. Home isolation of new arrivals, most of them returning citizens, is enforced by base station triangulation explained Mr Jyan. It operates through a mobile phone-based “electronic fence” that uses location-tracking to ensure quarantined people remain at home. The system begins at the airport, when arriving passengers fill out a form on their mobile phones and the details are fed into a centralised tracing system. Each case is then assigned a social worker, health and police officer. The social worker calls twice a day to check the person doesn’t avoid tracking by leaving their phone behind. If a phone is unanswered every 15 minutes for an hour, it prompts a home visit by the police. In addition, the person’s mobile location is monitored through its communication with the nearest base station, giving a rough range of about 300 metres.  If the phone leaves this area, the user and local officials receive an automated text message alert. “Everything is based on guidelines to keep the balance between tracing and privacy protection..using mobile signals is less of a privacy invasion than GPS because GPS is very precise. We only use this rough position,” said Mr Jyan. He said there was a noticeable shift in behaviour between business travellers in isolation and an influx of students returning from the US and Europe in mid-March. Younger people tried to test the boundaries of their mobile phone ranges, triggering multiple alerts to tell them to go home. Quarantine violations can result in hefty fines of up to $33,000 – a maximum penalty that was slapped on one young man in March when he broke quarantine to go to a nightclub and got caught in a police spot check. However, fines were only one reason the system had a near universal compliance record for more than 9,100 currently being monitored, said Mr Jyan. “Our citizens believe they should stay at home and not hurt other people. I think that is part of the culture.”To ensure privacy, only the commander of the Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has access to the names of the mobile phone users, and has a nationwide overview. There is a firewall between each county’s monitoring information and names are not given to the police, only phone numbers. All information is deleted at the end of the 14-day period. The tracing of iniduals in direct or suspected contact with infected iniduals is another key component in Taiwan’s armory, and also depends heavily on location tracking linked to base stations. As an island, Taiwan’s two biggest pandemic scares have been related to infected ships.When the ill-fated Diamond Princess cruise liner docked in the northern port of Keelung, thousands of passengers – an unknown number Covid-19 positive – fanned out across densely populated areas. News of the outbreak broke days later when the ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, and Taiwan’s disease detectives rushed into action. With the help of telecoms operators they first identified all foreign numbers pinging off the mobile phone mast where the ship was docked. These were then matched to base stations around the island to track where the passengers had gone sightseeing. The third step was to compare the time and location of the foreign numbers with local numbers that were in the same vicinity within the same 15-minute window, which resulted in 620,000 matches. A blanket emergency alert urging people to look out for Covid-19 symptoms and call a central helpline if ill was sent to everyone in northern Taiwan, and also specifically to the 620,000 identified mobile numbers.A similar approach was taken in April when sailors linked to a cluster on a naval ship travelled across the island before being recalled to quarantine. Over 200,000 people whose phones matched the same time and vicinity as the sailors received a warning alert. In addition, contact tracers interviewed the sailors to identify and tracked over 1,200 iniduals who they had directly interacted with. Human intelligence is carried out by the CECC, who draft an investigation report that can then be checked by the police using CCTV and mobile phone records. The surveillance is regulated by the Communicable Disease Control Act drafted after a deadly SARS outbreak in 2003, which places strict curbs on what data can be gathered and how long it can be retained for. Tools like facial recognition are taboo. After emerging to democracy in 1987 after a decades-long period of brutal martial law, and living in shadow of the Chinese surveillance state, Taiwan’s citizens cherish their hard-won freedoms. For that reason, and while the virus remains under control, Taiwan has not adopted GPS and Bluetooth apps developed between government cyber officials and private company Taiwan AI Labs. But the apps, which use more precise technology, could be valuable options for countries like the UK where the virus is already widespread. For the Bluetooth social distancing app, smartphones exchange data with other devices at a close range of 10 to 100 metres and can more precisely judge the range of contact with an infected case.To preserve privacy, citizens can download and use the app without having to register. Alerts about contacts with Covid-19 cases also do not provide precise information of detailed times and locations that could identify the patient.Taiwan’s app is unique as after installation, the smartphone generates a new scrambled ID every 15 minutes, sending out a new ID every time. The Bluetooth devices on inidual handsets only record each other’s hashed IDs, along with the duration and distance of contact.The app does not store private details, and is legally blocked from sending the data to the government. It complies with Taiwan’s personal protection laws and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation.A similar contact tracing app tabled by the NHS involves a unique ID code being generated for a user just once, making it less secure than the Taiwanese model.An alternative model proposed by Apple and Google in the UK aims to address privacy concerns tied to the NHS’ first app with similar features to the Taiwan app.A “decentralised” system means data is not sent to the government or a public health body, while location data and other information that could potentially identify someone is left out. “It’s a balance. Privacy protection is the red line the government should not cross,” said Mr Jyan. “We are very happy to provide this app if another country wants to use it.” More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers accused obstructing online study","story":"Teachers have been accused of “blocking” children’s lockdown learning by citing union guidelines which say they should not conduct any online lessons which made them feel “uncomfortable”.The UK’s biggest teaching union, the National Education Union (NEU), has told its members that online lessons should be kept to “a minimum” and that they “cannot be expected to carry out routine marking or grading” of pupils’ work while schools are closed.The advice document published by the NEU adds that teachers should not live-stream lessons from home or do any video calls with pupils unless in “exceptional circumstances”.When parents who have complained about the lack of school work during lockdown, they have been told by headteachers that their hands are tied because of the opposition they have come against from the unions.One headteacher from Brighton told The  that he had hoped that teachers would produce a couple of online lessons each week, either live or pre-recorded videos, to keep children motivated and engaged.“Some teachers say that they are not willing to do it and that you can’t make them because the unions say they don’t have to,” he said.“There is not a huge amount I can do if I am honest. You could try and enforce it but you would never get very far, they would just down tools and say ‘you can’t force me’.”Marking and grading work is also important to keep children motivated, the headteacher said, adding: “I don’t really understand what the unions have against that.  If you are not marking the work, children won’t see the point of doing it.  “At the end of the day, children should be at the forefront of our thinking. This is not a one off, it’s a national emergency, you would think the unions would be a bit more understanding of that.”The NEU has issued two sets of guidelines for distance teaching and learning during the coronavirus pandemic, one for primary teachers and another for secondary teachers.“Teachers should not live-stream lessons from their homes, nor engage in any video-calling unless in exceptional circumstances, with the parent,” the primary school guidelines said.“Online lessons are not desirable for primary children as the teacher-pupil interaction is not easily replicated.”  Meanwhile, the secondary school advice document states: “If schools have systems set up for online lessons, these should be kept to a minimum as the interaction needed between teacher and pupils in school is high and cannot be easily replicated for a young audience, even at KS4 level.“Any school which carries out online lessons must have protocols in place to protect staff and safeguard pupils, and no teacher should be expected to carry out any online teaching with which they feel uncomfortable or in the absence of agreed protocols.”  One parent, who complained to her child’s school about the lack of work, said that she found the answer that teachers were refusing to set work online “infuriating”.  “Parents are desperately trying to struggle with working from home,” she said. “I found the fact that its unions blocking it to be really shocking.  Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, defended the guidelines and said that his members are working “flat out” to support students.The guidelines are aimed at managing the workload and stress of children, parents and teachers, he said, adding that they are “not about preventing learning”.  Mr Courtney said: “Arrangements for online learning must also protect teachers\u0027 and childrens\u0027 privacy and ensure children are kept safe while online. The NEU is supporting teachers and families to do the best they can with the resources available to them.  “We are suggesting ways of providing creative packs for younger pupils, and access to real books and printed resources - because online learning simply is not accessible for many pupils, too many have limited access to laptops or quiet space in which to view lessons at set times of day.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk intelligence agencies examining report mobile phone data","story":"US and British intelligence agencies are reportedly examining mobile phone data suggesting there could have been an emergency shutdown in October at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to a report, obtained by NBC News, there was no mobile phone activity in a high-security part of the Chinese laboratory complex from Oct 7 to Oct 24. Previously, there had been consistent use of mobile phones.The report, carried out by private experts, suggested there may have been a hazardous event, specifically at the institute\u0027s National Biosafety Laboratory, between Oct 6 and Oct 11.Analysis of mobile phone data from the area surrounding the institute also suggested roadblocks were in place between Oct 14 and Oct 19.Experts urged caution over the report, suggesting it may be based on only limited commercially available mobile phone data, and that there could be other reasons for varying levels of phone usage.However, the document could be what Donald Trump was referring to when the president recently said he had seen evidence giving him a high degree of confidence the pandemic began accidentally at the Wuhan laboratory.The prevailing theory is that the virus originated in bats and crossed over to humans at a market in Wuhan.But US intelligence agencies continue to investigate the Wuhan laboratory and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has said there is a significant amount of evidence.It was unclear which private organisation carried out the leaked analysis of the mobile phone location data.But the 24-page report suggested it supports the release of Covid-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that the pandemic began earlier than previously thought. The first confirmed case so far in China was on Nov 17.The document was obtained by NBC News in London. In addition to intelligence agencies it has been seen by the US Senate intelligence committee.Several days ago Marco Rubio, the Republican senator who sits on the committee, wrote on Twitter: Would be interesting if someone analyzed commercial telemetry data at \u0026amp near Wuhan lab from Oct-Dec 2019.If it shows dramatic drop off in activity compared to previous 18 months it would be a strong indication of an incident at lab \u0026amp of when it happened.China has denied that the virus escaped from the Wuhan laboratory.US officials said they had previously looked at other reports, also based on publicly available mobile phone data, suggesting a shutdown at the Wuhan laboratory.They went on to examine their own data, including satellite images, and could not establish that there had been a temporary closure at the Wuhan lab, deciding that the suggestion was inconclusive.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/19/15/gettyimages-597561960.jpg","title":"britney spears new album glory cover artwork release date","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Singer shared the album art to\u0026nbspher Instagram account and wrote a message thanking fans for their supportBritney Spears has unveiled brand new artwork for her 2016 album, Glory, as a “thank you” to fans who helped the record make it to the top of the iTunes chart last week.A discussion broke out on social media this month as a number of Spears fans said they believed the singer’s ninth album was underrated.The new artwork, which has appeared on streaming services and was shared by Spears on her Instagram account.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt shows her lying on her back in the desert while wearing a gold two-piece and surrounded by chains.“You asked for a new Glory cover and since it went to number one we had to make it happen!” Spears wrote in the caption. “Couldn’t have done it without you.”How female artists are writing their way out of traumaBritney Spears has become a source of light in this time of crisisKehlani shows a emotional intelligence on her new albumGlory\u0026nbspreceived a number of positive reviews from critics, who said Spears\u0027 vocal work was a vast improvement from her previous albums, while one compared it favourably to her Toxic era.Entertainment Weekly\u0026nbspdescribed the album as her most engaging vocally in a decade and noted Spears as sounding more present and enthusiastic than she has in years.\u0026nbspUpon its release,\u0026nbspGlory\u0026nbspbecame Spears\u0027 highest-charting album since her 2007\u0026nbspcomeback album,\u0026nbspBlackout.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together they are expected to help contribute towards observations from telescopes like Hubble and data from the Juno spacecraft to better understand our still mysterious, huge neighbour.NASA images of Jupiter turned into beautiful abstract artworksThe Gemini data were critical because they allowed us to probe deeply into Jupiter\u0027s clouds on a regular schedule, said Michael Wong of UC Berkeley.The scientists used a technique called lucky imaging, Wong said, which sees scientists take a vast number of very short exposure images, but filters them so that only the sharpest images taken when Earth\u0027s atmosphere is stable are used. That allowed the scientists to create images that rival the view from space, Wong said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There has since been no update on this guidance.Immigration lawyers accused the department of leaving people in a “stressful and precarious” situation by maintaining that the visa extensions would only last\u0026nbspuntil the end of this month, and called on ministers to urgently\u0026nbspextend the date to September.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesVisa holders who did not qualify for the extension but whose visas are due to expire soon after 31 May are also worried because lockdown has meant they are unable to apply to extend their leave due to the closure of English\u0026nbsplanguage test centres and the inability to make\u0026nbspapplications that need to be submitted from outside\u0026nbspthe UK.Ben Hicks, 36, said his family had been left in limbo because they have been unable to get clarity on\u0026nbspwhether his Chinese wife, Tingting Zhang, 36, who flew from\u0026nbspWuhan on an evacuation flight in February to be with him\u0026nbspand their five-year-old daughter Sufei, would be able to stay in Britain.Home Office criticised over ‘lack of clarity’ on NHS visa extensionsMigrants told to rely on ‘investments and savings’ during lockdownHome Office urged to grant NHS visa extensions to care workers Ms Zhang, who was granted a six-month visa\u0026nbspon arriving in the UK, had been planning to submit a spouse application before the pandemic started so that she could live with her husband and daughter permanently, but because it is an out-of-country\u0026nbspapplication ⁠–\u0026nbspmeaning it has to be submitted from outside the UK ⁠–\u0026nbspshe is now not able to do so.The Home Office has said that people whose visas expire before the end of May can apply for out-of-country visas\u0026nbspfrom inside Britain, but Ms Zhang’s\u0026nbspvisit visa ends in August so she does not qualify.Mr Hicks, who met his wife 12 years ago while they were both working on a cruise ship, said he was being “sent round in circles” when he tried to phone the Home Office to clarify what they should do, and that the situation was putting the family’s life on hold for even longer.The couple already faced a setback in starting a life together when the Home Office refused Ms Zhang’s fiancee visa in 2014 on the basis that Mr Hicks was not working in the UK, due to working on a cruise ship. Since then, they have spent long periods apart while he has looked for a new job\u0026nbspin order to meet the minimum income requirement for a spouse visa.“I’ve been working hard for nine months to get this sorted. We just want to get on with it so we can finally start a life together as a family. If it wasn’t for the pandemic we would have applied by now and she would probably be here long-term. But at this point, unless the Home Office revises the guidance, she will have to leave again\u0026nbspin August,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ve had to say something because it would look bad if they said nothing, but that’s as far as this has gone.”Families are also concerned because\u0026nbspmany\u0026nbspvisas, including spouse visas, require a valid English language test in order to make an application, and currently test centres are set to be closed until at least June.Immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal said: “Many people have had deadlines which have passed or are approaching in the immediate future. The Home Office has failed to provide a concession or any sort of clear guidance for people in this situation.“If they apply without a test they run the risk of refusal or even having their route changed from five years to 10 years. If refused, they potentially face a financial loss of around £2,000 to £3,000, the risk of becoming overstayers and hence ‘illegal’ and will no doubt lose their jobs and possibly also face removal action and hence be potentially split up from their families.”Mr Bhangal warned that a Windrush-style issue could emerge, adding: “The Home Office tends to wait for a problem or scandal to occur and then try to solve it as opposed to try and prevent foreseeable problems in the first place.“We have seen this with the recent Windrush scandal, which could have been prevented if the Home Office had been proactive and more willing to just talk to the victims before issuing removal and deportation notices. We could potentially face a similar situation here where people begin to get refused or become fearful to apply due to the Home Office’s failure to foresee this problem.”Sonia\u0026nbspLenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA), said: “In just over three weeks the current extension of leave is due to end. The Home Office cannot realistically expect all of those people to get on a plane between now and then.“It is not right to leave people in such a stressful and precarious position. Another, lengthy, extension must be confirmed as a matter of urgency. In March,\u0026nbspILPA\u0026nbsprecommended an extension until September, and that remains our position.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We have extended visas to 31 May 2020 for all foreign nationals who are lawfully in the UK and unable to return home and expanded in-country switching provisions.“This is being kept under regular review, but no one will be penalised for circumstances outside of their control.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It represents community and people coming together.”The Food for London campaign was launched to support The Felix Project in delivering food to frontline charities, vulnerable people and NHS staff in London.

Now the total population of the island is reduced to 36. Several men out of this number have definitely made up our minds to go away this year to such employment on the mainland.“This will really cause a crisis as the present number are hardly sufficient to carry on the necessary work of the place.“These men are the mainstay of the island at present, as they tend the sheep, do the weaving and look after the general welfare of the widows.“Should they leave the conditions of the rest of the community would be such that it would be impossible for us to remain on the island another winter.”The islanders said they did not ask to be settled together as a separate community, but were seeking help to be moved somewhere where “there would be a better opportunity of securing our livelihood”.St Kilda is the UK’s only dual Unesco World Heritage Site – for natural and cultural heritage – and is home to the UK’s largest colony of Atlantic puffins.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

E-scooter trials will also be fast-tracked by ministers – from next year to next month.Mr Shapps said: “This £2bn announcement represents the most significant package of cycling, walking and green travel by any British government.”The announcement comes as campaigners called for a fundamental redesign of the transport system to help prevent a bounce-back in air pollution once the lockdown is eventually lifted by the government.In a letter to Mr Shapps and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, nine organisations, including Greenpeace UK and Transport Action Network, said it would be “completely absurd\u0026nbspif, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from Covid-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution”.A YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace also found that 71 per cent of the public were concerned about the possibility of air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels once the stringent restrictions are lifted.The survey also suggested\u0026nbsp58 per cent backed the introduction of cycle lanes on urban main roads, along with increased government funding for walking and cycling infrastructure.Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s his choice,” she tweeted on Thursday.Mr Polk replied: “Thanks for the support mayor!”Explaining his reasons for recalling the mayor, Mr Polk said he doesn’t only want to recall her for wanting to “reopen Las Vegas” in the midst of a pandemic, but also for putting casino owners’ interests above those of the people of the city.“I don’t want to recall the mayor just because she wants to re-open Las Vegas,” he tweeted.“She also cares more about the ‘sensitive’ casino owners interests than the people of Las Vegas.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on. We are more than happy to use them for a little while longer.As for employers, they have built everything from thriving construction businesses to high-tech apps.It is not going to be beyond them to install plastic screens in the office, and nor are Lisa in marketing and Phil in accounts going to make like Professor Pantsdown in the filing cupboard.Are we prepared to trust our fellow Brits, take that risk and allow the next generation a better chance to succeed Even some of those in the highest at-risk groups will acknowledge we cannot live in economic shutdown forever.Even the boffins at Oxford know a vaccine will take months,not years.AndTikTok-ing millennials are not exactly winning much sympathy, what about the parents of young kids Anybody looking after children at home right now knows full well their productivity is close to zero.They need schools and nurseries open, too.Britain’s most dynamic cities and companies are being driven by the young, from the video game industry in Dundee to the start-up hubs of Shoreditch.They have had a decade of flatlining wages, a housing crisis and now the corona crash. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering. They’re cooking for family members. They’re talking on Zoom to isolated elderly relatives.Millennials who had become turned off and disillusioned with public le during the partisan Brexit wars are starting to re-engage with politics, aware of the real-le impact of decisions made by our leaders.Ridiculous snowflake battles around identity politics and social issues now feel meaningless.I hope and pray that when we look back in many decades’ time, we will be talking about how the historic coronavirus pandemic of  helped create a new greatest generation in the same way the end of World War Two did  years earlier.But tomorrow my thoughts will be entirely with all four of my grandparents — Bill, Cath, RAF airman John George Wheeler and London Blitz survivor Sylvia Jean Cook — who put their coming of age aside for the good of the country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its quite cool to be fair.It was cut out and painted last weekend. We use it most nights.The hatch, which is a metre wide and a half metre high, is attached to chains and latches and was designed to drop down to the height of a bar in a normal pub.It is also fitted with , which both neighbours have to open and when it is closed it still looks like an ordinary fence.While Kris uses a director’s chair to relax in, sales director Tony uses bar stools because the land on his side is lower down.Kris added: We built the houses together and got to know Tony andSue well over the years.We both have bars in each others gardens, which is quite good for a bbq.Usually one weekend were at theirs and vice versa. But obviously we cant be this close.However, we can have the music playing from the cave while were sitting there with the patio heater on having a few gins together.They got the idea from social media after neighbours in Australia revolved a whole fence  and put a table leg underneath.Earlier this month a family in York transformed their  drab garden shed into an impressive Tiki bar.Last month Will Davies turned his shed into a boozer in time for his daughter’s th so she could fulfil her wish and buy him a pint while the lockdown was in place."},{"url":null,"title":"ibiza deserted coronavirus pictures party islands transformation","story":"EERIE photos show Spanish party paradise Ibiza completely deserted as the coronavirus wrecks Brits summer plans.The Balearic island would normally be gearing up for holiday season around this time of year, but the closure of clubs and resorts have left it almost totally empty.Party season usually begins in Ibiza at the end of April, with Brits jetting out for long weekends of partying and sun since the early s.Popular clubs like O-beach, Nikki Beach and Ushuaia are all completely shut down, and are using this time to do maintenance, as these spooky images show.The islands economy is almost completely reliant on the major music festivals and club nights which normally take place during the summer, which have now been forced to cancel as a result of lockdown in Spain.Around % of the populations income is thought to come from tourism.But now there are warnings that entire streets of bars may never be able to open again following the pandemic.But party season has been cancelled due to the pandemic, leaving the streets empty.While the islands are trying to rally airlines to restart flights to the island, low-cost airlines Ryanair and Jet are to remain grounded until at least mid-June.Tourists are also unlikely toat all during the summer, with Spain prioritising domestic tourism at first, and only then will limited overseas travellers begin to book holidays again.Balearic Islands tourism minister Iago Negueruela has already warned that Brits will not be among those ing to the area this summer.He told local media last month: “There are countries like the United Kingdom that took too long to adopt confinement measures.”The island has been renowned for its club scene since the s, and venues like DC and Amnesia are known worldwide.Every year, fans of electronic music from around the fans flock to the exclusive clubs to see some of the globes most famous DJs.But these clubs have now cancelled all the events on their calendars, with some struggling for survival.Some large clubs, such as Ibiza Rocks and Pacha, are hoping to keep going, with the latter launching an online house party last month.Hoteliers in Ibiza are also calling for the tourist tax to be scrapped for two years in a bid to win British holidaymakers back to the islands again.Currently, tourists pay approximately £. a night, depending on the category of their accommodation and the time of year, meaning couples face paying an extra £ for a seven-night holiday.Hotel Federation of Ibiza and Formentera vice-president, Juanjo Riera told Periodico de Ibiza: It is no longer just knowing when Spanish tourists will be able to travel, it is about our main foreign market, which is the British one and we still do not know when it will be able to travel.Holidays to Spain are unlikely to be the same for a long time post-pandemic with new restrictions and social distancing measures.Tourists may have to sunbathe ft apart even after the end of the coronavirus crisis, as well as dine at restaurants in plastic booths.Hotels and resorts will also face strict new procedures, including closing common areas, operating at limited capacity and ridding of the buffet and room service.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage. There is a feeling of national unity now that I have never known in my letime.From the courage of NHS workers to the kindness of neighbours, we have witnessed the best of our people during this crisis.The sick man of Europe  Not us.

Even a slowly phasedto normal gets little support, with just four per cent in favour of a gradual lting of the lockdown starting this week.The results of our poll will be studied closely in  Downing Street as officials put the finishing touches to their blueprint for a slow and safe end to the lockdown today. Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith believes the health warnings have been too stark and the stay-at-home payments too generous.And he warned Mr Johnson it will be a massive undertaking to convince the nation it is safe to venture outside again.Mr Duncan Smith said: “The government’s rhetoric on the dangers of the virus has been so frightening nearly everyone has bought into it.“Strangely, the general public has grasped the idea that the economy is in deep trouble but many are happy to accept the huge furlough payments they are receiving to stay at home and do nothing.“They’ve been feather-bedded by the Chancellor and it seems to have generated a feeling that it can go on for ever and it’s risk-free.“The government has to change its message fast to win the same volume of support for ending the lockdown as it has for imposing it.”Our poll reveals public approval of the way the PM has handled the crisis — with  per cent saying he is doing a good job of leading Britain through the pandemic.But there are concerns about infection rates in care homes and lack of personal protective equipment for NHS staff.Six out of ten people believe the PM’s personal experience of Covid- makes him better placed to deal with the crisis.And two-thirds think it will make him more cautious about lting the restrictions too quickly.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gets a positive response for his performance as stand-in leader, as do Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The poll also confirms the pandemic will make us more fearful.

He gets in his car and tries to document that.The lawyer told reporters his client drove behind the McMichaels car because he didnt recognize Arbery after a supposed increase in burglaries in the locality but he knew their vehicle.Glynn County Police Detective Lt. Cheri Bashlor said there were no reported break ins for seven weeks leading up to the shooting, however. Bryan maintains he handed over the footage to cops on the scene, he has since lost his job, and his family have been threatened.So far, two district attorneys - including Barnhill - have been recused from from the case due to conflicts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in those four minutes she summed up the sacrice of the generation who fought the Second World War, she spoke of the pain of our own time and she explained what it all meant.I will never forget her speech.Because the Queen understands this country, and she understands our people, like nobody  ever will again.Her Majesty does not merely lt our spirits — she defines them.This is her second address to the nation in little over a month.“We will meet again,” she said in her April broadcast on coronavirus, and million people knew that things would get better, evenwe don’t know where, and don’t know when.Aged , after  years on the throne, she embodies the living history of our country like nobody has before and nobody ever will again.When she speaks of the war that still defines this country, she does so with a unique authority.She was there in , standing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, a -year-old proudly wearing her khaki Auxiliary Territorial Service unorm, soon to slip off into the euphoric crowds with her kid sister.Like my parents, the Queen lost her teenage years to the war — a child when the conflict began, she was a woman when it ended, celebrating her th birthday in , when the conflict was still raging.For her VE Day speech she wore the two diamond brooches her father gave her to mark that birthday.The Queen is a veteran of that terrible conflict too.It was not simply what she said. The Queen does a video backdrop better than any Zoom-savvy teenager.As she spoke for those unforgettable four minutes, your eyes drted to the photograph of her father, King George VIand her service cap and a picture of her family on the balcony on Buckingham Palace on VE Day.We talk a lot in this country about that generation, and have wondered oftenwe could do what they did.It is the Queen who has told us, more than once, that we are still the same people who freed the world  years ago.And you thought of the selfless NHS workers — and also the drivers of bus and Tube, the care home workers, the delivery guys, the bin men, the supermarket workers, all those unsung heroes who risk their lives so that others are safe — and her words rang so true that it broke your heart.“They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe,” said the Queen of the greatest generation. “We should and will remember them.”I have been privileged to know many veterans of the Second World War. They are all gone now.But yesterday their spirits were with me again because of the Queen’s speech.I felt their presence, I understood their sacrice and I was grateful once more for all the freedoms they bought with their blood.Those of us who were lucky enough to be born after the war come to take our freedoms for granted. The generation who we saluted on Friday know better.“At the start the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,” the Queen said. “But we kept faith.”The Queen was speaking of the war but her words resonated through our own struggle fighting an enemy we can’t see.“Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish,” she said.“Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But the streets are not empty. They are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.”This -year-old Queen is grandmother to the nation now.In her we glimpse mothers and nans and great-grandmothers long gone, and in her we see the wisdom and the love and the grit of our people.“Never give up, never despair — that was the message of VE Day.”Plain words, spoken from the heart, and inspirational.Because she understands that behind those jubilant VE Day crowds were families that had been shattered, mourning wives and sweethearts and mothers and orphaned children, and an army of angels in khaki and light and dark blue who never came home.And she acknowledged that on VE Day men were still men fighting and dying on the other side of the world.This Queen misses nothing. Indeed, she gets it so right that it takes your breath away.“When I look at our nation today,” she said, “and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”When the nation’s grandmother tells you that the greatest generation would be proud of us, she convinces in a way that no politician — nor indeed any other member of the Royal Family — ever could.We are so very lucky to have her.But, my God — what will we ever do without her To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.“I see extraordinary kindness every day, from the staff helping people to those wanting to give something back to them.”Andrew began volunteering for the hospital last month after being furloughed from his job as a chef at the Stop the World café in Leigh.He says: “The hospital had put an ad out for volunteers. I applied straight away. I wasn’t scared at all about working in a hospital during the crisis. I was just keen to help.”As well as manning the “kindness table” Andrew has also been driving to collect donations. Hardworking NHS staff are able to choose items, like cakes and chocolate, during their much-needed breaks.He says: “It’s the small things that brighten up their day and I’m glad I’m able to be part of this.”This is not Andrew’s first time volunteering.

It’s a full-time job. I’m so busy that I need a diary to schedule it all in.“But I realised early on there was an urgent need to support the most vulnerable. My mum Vivienne is  and my grandmother Margaret is  and they live on the same street – and I was taking deliveries from Surrey to Kent to them.“I knew there were thousands of others out there who also need support and help. With my training in infection-control, I was confident I could not only deliver what they need, but also do it with the minimum risk to them.”Abi, who is also a guest presenter on QVC and Ideal World, adds: “It may be dferent from my day job, but it is no less rewarding.“What really brought home the seriousness is that we do a weekly delivery of  food bags in a tiny village of just , people.“I was shocked so many people were self-isolating or shielding – but this is the effect of Covid-.”I’D like to thank my daughter SAMANTHA ELLIS. She’s helping on the call centre for Covid-, helping and directing people for testing. She works for Hays Travel and was put on furlough.

The now -strong group has raised over £, to make and deliver nearly  scrubs to Harrogate District Hospital.Many local companies are donating materials to support the volunteers who are daily making scrubs.

She baked me a cake on my birthday and I’d like to say a huge THANK YOU for everything she does.Kerry GanlyClare founded Mid Surrey Community Fridges with pal Tony White two years ago after seeing an item about food waste on Channel ’s Jamie And Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast.They started with a single fridge from which vulnerable people could pick up donated food for free.Now they deliver supplies to those in need – and the pandemic has seen a surge in demand. Last week they delivered , bags of donated food.Clare said: “We set up a community fridge to make unwanted food available for anyone that would like it, at no cost. When we opened, we literally had one fridge.“Since Covid-, demand has gone through the roof. My volunteers have been working -hour days, seven days a week.“We had to close the community fridges for safety reasons but quickly adapted to become a delivery service. At Christmas we had  volunteers. It’s now . A lot of these people have been furloughed, laid off or work part-time and want to do help. Every one of them is incredible.“Before Covid, we were processing kg of donated food a week. Last week it was ,kg. It’s the double low-income families and those on zero-hour contracts who need most help.”Clare fears the next six months will be even tougher for people as the full financial sting is felt.She added: “We’re just at the beginning of this. People from all walks of le will need our help.”PHOTOGRAPHER GILES DULEY is a triple amputee after stepping on an IED while working in Afghanistan. Though he runs a global charity supporting civilians affected by conflict, Giles is now helping his home town of Hastings.

Passengers arriving at airports and ports will have to provide an address at which they will immediately self-isolate for a fortnight, with the threat of a £, fine and even deportation enforcing the new rules. This could mean Brits will have to take one month offthey want to go on a two-week holiday - two weeks for a holiday, two weeks in quarantine at home afterwards. Thataposs sparked fears there will be no demand for holidays abroad this year and leading to calls for clarity from the tourism industry. The move is predicted by the Times to be announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his address to the nation tomorrow, and the measure is expected to be implemented in June. The paper reports that authorities will conduct spot checks, with punishments for those not adhering to the rules including fines of up to £, and deportation. A Home Office spokeswoman said: We do not comment on leaks. The focus remains on staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives. The aviation industry is calling on the Government to reveal specics of the proposal amid concerns that the measures could have severe repercussions for the travel and tourism sectors. We need to see the details of what they are proposing, Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and other UK-based airlines, said in a statement. Airlines UK issued a statement saying the proposal would effectively kill international travel to and from UK and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy. For the latest coronavirus updates, follow our liveblogIt added: Nobody is going to go on holidaytheyaposre not able to resume normal le for  days, and business travel would be severely restricted. It will also make it all but impossible for aviation to resume any time soon, thereby setting back the UKaposs economic recovery still further. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast: Itaposs something that weaposve been asking ministers to clary for weeks now. I raised it with the minister for the fth time on Thursday because itaposs caused real confusion. At the moment weaposve got a lot of Britons who are still stranded abroad. People have been brought back in relatively large numbers and many of them are telling us that they have no information or advice given out about what they should be doing when they get home. They travel back from the airport on public transport, they go back to their families and theyaposre worried that theyaposre putting their families and other members of the public at risk, and some of them are coming from parts of the country where we are seeing an increase in infection rates, and so theyaposre really worried about it, the wider public are really worried about it, and for weeks weaposve had mixed messages being briefed out of government.  She added: I think thereaposs a real reluctance to do anything without official advice at the moment, so I donapost think the big problem is getting people to follow it. The big problem is actually getting that advice to people in the first place and itaposs been far too slow and far too confusing for most people. Thereaposs also a very real outstanding issue about the way in which people are being brought back into the country. A lot of the cases that Iaposm dealing with - my office is in touch with around , British nationals who are still stranded abroad - is about how they get to the airport on the other side of the border. People travelling across Spain, for example, on coaches, they get to the airport, itaposs very crowded, theyaposre being crammed onto planes without social distancing measures in place. Some of them are telling me thereaposs no hand gel available. Then, of course, thereaposs no testing facilities when they arrived back into the UK, so itaposs welcome that the Government has started to respond to this, but weaposve got to get much, much quicker at this or weaposre going to see a resurgence in cases.  The ISU union - which represents borders, immigration and customs staff - called for clarity on the quarantine plans. ISU professional officer Lucy Moreton told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: At the moment this is just a leak, so we havenapost had any particular information. Thereaposs a little bit of a discrepancy about whether this is airline passengers only or whether this is going to include iniduals arriving by boat. And what are we going to do with the irregular migrants who donapost have a private house to self-isolate in  Seemingly frustrated about no concrete information, she added: Iaposm hoping someone will get round to telling the staff at some point. She also questioned how it will be implemented, saying: Thereaposs no way for that e-gate to collect an address so weaposd have to do something, either shut those down completely or post staff either before or after to collect addresses. Airport Operators Associationchief executive Karen Dee said she has not received any details yet about a mandatory -day quarantine for all travellers into the UK. She told BBC Breakfast: I think thereaposs been lots of speculation in the press recently, and of course the transport secretary was on the Andrew Marr show last week, so although we havenapost had any details yet thereaposs been a lot of speculation that there will be a -day quarantine for passengers ing to the UK. That would have a really big impact on our sector, but at the moment we donapost have very much detail about what that would mean.  Ms Dee added: We see passenger numbers typically down by about % now in the UK. So, you know, a lot of airports now are closed for passenger traffic. There are very few flights coming in and that means no revenue, so weaposre really having to adjust and see our way through. The AOA chief executive said it was not known exactly what measures will be brought in for air travel. She told BBC Breakfast: Weaposre not medical experts and thataposs why weaposre keen to work with government and internationally to say what are the best things that we can do  Is it better cleaning and sanitation or hand sanitisers in the airport  Is it face masks and gloves for passengers to avoid touching  Is it some form of temperature checks at the airports or before they travel  Or other kind of testing that might evolve in the next few days or weeks  So at the moment, it could be a range of those options. She added: I think that there will be a range of things that passengers will see once we begin to scale back up, but at the moment I think itaposs really important that governments work with each other to say aposletaposs get one single international standardapos so that passengers know what theyaposre going to expect, wherever they are that theyaposre travellingapos.  It was put to Ms Dee that it would seem she has not had clear notication or clear guidance from the Government yet about what needs to be put in place. Asked what her impression is of not having had clarity, she told BBC Breakfast: I think the problem with that lack of clarity means that weaposre unable to plan. So, you know, itaposs perhaps not surprising that we donapost have that standard agreed, and we know that the Government is working now very closely, both with the industry and internationally, to look at what the science tells us we should do. So it is a problem as we begin to start and we will see some flights begin to take off, mostly repatriation at the moment of course, but I think it causes some confusion and what weaposre really keen to ensure is that those passengers that do begin to come back to us feel reassured, and also our staff. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport Newquay, warned of uncertainty for staff and businesses from reports of a -day quarantine for travellers entering the UK. He was generally critical of the Governmentaposs handling of borders, telling BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It was possibly inevitable but to say that itaposs come too late would be something of an understatement. He added that questioning the management and the planning of this is going to be very much at the forefront today. Now it does look that even though weaposre potentially past the peak weaposre going to close our borders and all the plans that airlines and airports had to start restarting operations are now on the scrapheap and will have to go back to square one, he continued.

On Sunday, Boris Johnson is set to reveal the Governmentaposs road map, setting out a plan on how restrictions will begin to be lted. Weaposve taken a look at eight sectors which will be affected by changes as the country begins to open back up. From our favourite fast food, to schools, workplaces and transport, here is what the initial stages could look like. International travel Travellers coming in to the UK could be expected to quarantine for  days after their arrival, reports suggest. Those visiting the UK will have to fill in a digital form and declare an address where they will then be expected to self-isolate for two weeks, according to The Times. For the latest coronavirus updates, follow our liveblog The paper reported that travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will be exempt from the quarantine. Briefing reporters on Friday, Downing Street confirmed quarantining foreign visitors was being looked at as a way of guarding the country against a second peak in the transmission rate. Passengers travelling through Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports are being ordered to cover their faces and wear gloves. Heathrow Airport has said it will introduce temperature screening, which will initially be used to monitor arriving passengers in immigration halls but could also be deployed in areas for departures, connections and airport staff searches. Shops Garden centres will be allowed to reopen to customers from Wednesday May , Boris Johnson will announce. Bosses will have to ensure shoppers obey social distancing measures, such as keeping two metres away from others, and will be expected to put restrictions in place, including queuing systems and installing Perspex shields to protect till staff. A senior Government source said: Garden centres are typically open large open-air spaces where the risk of transmission of coronavirus is lower. Last month, the British Retail Consortium published guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lted, including limiting entry and exit points and using floor markings to outline social distancing. The workplace  Employees in non-essential industries who have been operating from home may be allowed toto work - but they might be encouraged to wear face masks and opt for a bike ride to avoid public transport where possible. Businesses wanting employees toto the office could be made to stagger shts, and ensure there are hand-washing facilities, hand gel and PPE supplies readily available. Boris Johnson will recommend workers wear masks when they doto work and when using public transport, The Dailyreported. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is set to use his appearance at the Downing Street briefing on Saturday to unveil a further £ million for extra cycle lanes, while trials on the use of e-scooters on British roads are due to be fast-tracked, it is understood. Pubs and restaurants  Fast food franchises including McDonaldaposs and KFC have already announced they will begin opening locations for delivery services, with more sites likely to reopen in the coming weeks. Environment Secretary George Eustice said this week that drive-through restaurants such as McDonaldaposs are made for social distancing. The popular fast food chain has conducted trials on reopening stores, with  restaurants opening for deliveries from next week. Before reopening, the restaurants will be deep cleaned while new safety measures will be introduced such as Perspex screens and floor markings. The reopening of pubs and bars however is unlikely to happen any time soon, with some reports claiming they will notuntil August and September. Schools  Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said schools will not reopen in Wales in June. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio aposs Today programme he expects Walesaposs very modest lockdown easing to be in line with what Boris Johnson will announce for England. Meanwhile unions sent a joint statement to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson on Friday, outlining a list of key measures which they say must be met before pupils in England can safelyto their desks. It includes extra money for deep cleaning and personal protective equipmentand local powers to close schoolsclusters of Covid- infections break out in a particular area. Exercise and the outdoors  According to some reports, unlimited outdoor exercise will be allowed from Monday, however gyms and playgrounds are expected to remain closed. Public Health England has signalled the stay home message could be abandoned and reports suggest people using benches, having picnics or sunbathing will no longer be asked to move on, provided they keep two metres apart. Public transport Bus and train timetables are likely to be adjusted and increased to help the system cope with an increase in passengers. There could also be further guidance on wearing masks while travelling after a survey by rail and road watchdog Transport Focus found % of people would not be happy using trains and buses unless passengers were required to wear them. It has been reported Boris Johnson will recommend workers wear masks when using public transport. He previously said face coverings will be useful when lockdown restrictions are eased.

It may also reduce the numbers of commuters on trains and buses, where the virus can easily spread. One minister reportedly told the : It makes complete sense. It would mean employees would not feel compelled toto the office and businesses may be able to limit the cost of alterations to workplaces, which would otherwise be necessary to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of the virus. It is said the proposal, suggested by officials during discussions over the Governmentapossto work package, is being modelled on existing rules governing the rights of parents to request flexible working from their boss. The Prime Minister promised greater flexibility for workers in his  party manesto. The manesto read: We will encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to. This followed a review by political strategist Matthew Taylor in , in which he wrote: Encouraging flexible work is good for everyone and has been shown to have a positive impact on productivity, worker retention and quality of work. Company bosses preparing to reopen offices shuttered are contemplating radical changes to the workplace to keep staff safe. Hand sanitisers and thermal scanners are just the start. Some firms are considering remodelling their offices to minimise the risk of a second wave of infections. Long rows of desks may be out, work stations sheathed with glass sneeze guards may be in.For the latest coronavirus updates, follow our liveblog Companies may be required to foot the bill for face masks for their staff whoto the office. A Government spokesman said: The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence toto work. New research suggests almost half of workers believe they will spend less time in offices as a result of the coronavirus crisis. A survey of , workers found that almost one in two predicted a permanent change to their employersapos approach to flexible working when the lockdown lts.  Almost half of those surveyed by ICM for O said flexible working will increase, with a third expecting to increase the amount they work from home by at least three days a week. Many employees admitted the lack of social interaction was challenging, with a third saying working from home can be lonely, and one in four missing socialising with colleagues. Dr Heejung Chung, social policy director at the University of Kent, who is currently researching the impact of flexible working, said: It will be dficult to go back to normal ways of working after lockdown, as weaposve now proved that most of us can work from home, despite many companies previously telling employees that it wouldnapost be possible. Unions warn that many members are worried about being unable to practise social distancing should theyto work.  Last week, union bosses expressed fury at the governmentaposs back-to-work rules, branding them an open goal for rogue bosses. The TUCaposs general secretary Frances OaposGrady is understood to have urged ministers to strengthen their protections for workers with other union chiefs warning their members may refuse to workthey donapost feel safe. Department of Business officials are drawing up guidance to get people back to work in the coming weeks. Recommendations could include staggering sht times to ease the rush hour, avoiding hot-desking or sharing pens, closing lts and canteens.  But, although bosses are currently advised to keep workers two metres apart wherever possible, the guidance states: It will not always be possible to keep a distance of m. In these circumstances both employers and employees must do everything they can to reduce risk. Cabinet minister Ben Wallace signalled some firms will be allowed to adopt other measures, even halving the distance to one metreworkers are given screens and protective kit. He said: You could wear PPE, that could be a possibility, or indeed you could find other ways of doing it, shielding for example. Unions slammed the guidance - which only asks firms to consider the moves - insisting bosses should be forced to adopt them. TUC general secretary Frances OaposGrady said: Throughout this crisis the TUC has sought to engage constructively with ministers. But we cannot support the Governmentaposs back-to-work plans as they stand. They are an open goal for rogue employers, who will cut corners and put their workers, and the wider community, at risk.

We’ve been mates for  years and she knows me better than anyone. So to know she’s had the worst week of her le and I can’t be there for her is heartbreaking. And now I’m angry too. Jo’s dad was poorly. He collapsed at home and an ­ambulance came. He spent two weeks in hospital, on his own, with Jo taking him clean clothes, which she had to give to a nurse. The family knew they had to stick to the rules to protect others. Then I got the news from Jo. “Dad’s gone to sleep for good.” Hearing my soulmate go through the most painful experience of her le, I felt helpless and frustrated. I wanted to hug her, make her a cup of tea and look after things while she came to terms with a le without her hero in it. But I knew I couldn’t jump in my car and see her. Just like she had sacriced those precious final moments with her dad and couldn’t say goodbye. But you have to think of others and be a good citizen. Only, hang on, it’s okay to get your lover around for a quick bonk. Professor Neil Ferguson, the guy who instigated the lockdown and lectured the nation on social distancing, happily stuck two fingers up to his own rules. Inviting his married lover around was an “error of judgment” he said.  We’ve all been falling in line with this top scientist. When he says jump, most of us say how high – and with or without a face mask, Prof  We trusted his expertise. He was the smartest we had. So what a slap in the face to we ordinary folk when he decides it’s one rule for him and another for us. It’s a daily fear for many of us with elderly friends and relatives – them being taken to hospital, out of reach and left alone. For elderly people too, the thought of being left to die alone is too much to bear. And then the added trauma of funerals, when you can’t even say goodbye to loved ones properly.

One person commented: “Omg donapost know how u do it I have  children getting them motivated is so hard well done you have a lovely family please give me tips on how u get the children to listen lol.“ And just  hours later, on Tuesday, they created a water park and play area in their very own back garden which looks totally awesome. It includes a swing set, slide, climbing frame as well as a mud kitchen.  They have also added some cute personalised teepees, with a comfy seating area for all the family.Sue and Noel shared videos of the outdoor set-up on their Instagram Stories and YouTube showing their family enjoying the garden and enjoying some ice lollies.Some also took their scooters for a whizz. on the astroturf. Meanwhile, they also added a dinosaur-themed water feature which comes with a mini slide and a large paddling pool for the children to cool off in. The couple bought the Victorian property, a former care home in Morecambe, more than  years ago and keep it in immaculate condition. They first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting Sue fell pregnant with her first child at age . Her and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits.A number of their children have already flown the nest and are married and have children of their own.The Radfords welcomed the nd baby to the family back in April with Sue announcing the news on Facebook.Born on April , Sue and Noel revealed the name of the baby girl was Heidie Rose a few days later.

The kit turns every soldier into a sharpshooter by using computer image processing that locks on to targets and never misses. It can be fitted to any type of rle and has been hailed as an infantry warfare “game changer”. The SAS is understood to be particularly keen after America’s secretive Delta Force called the scope “outstanding”. It works by finding targets automatically and placing red squares around them. The soldier presses the trigger and holds it until the system releases a bullet within a millisecond. The scope calculates several factors including distance, angles, motion and wind speed – and is just as deadly at night as in daylight. It has been developed by Israeli firm Sharp Shooter and costs just £.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce the measure on Sunday when he sets out his roadmap for how restrictions will gradually be lted. Although face masks will not be made compulsory, Brits are to be urged to wear them at work, on public transport and while out shopping to reduce the risk of a second wave of Covid- infections, thereports. It is expected that most people will be asked to wear non-medical coverings, to avoid running down supplies needed for NHS and social care staff, and other key workers. A cabinet minister told thethat it is hoped that the new guidance will give people the confidence to get back to work. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog hereThere is a theory that wearing masks might make people less vigilant, but this is about giving people confidence toto work, they said. If it makes people feel safer using public transport then it is a good thing, so we are leaning towards it. UK social distancing rules do not currently recommend that the public wear masks, with some experts warning that they could make people less likely to observe social distancing rules such as keeping a safe distance from each other. However, countries including Germany, Italy and the US have all recommended wearing some form of face covering in order to reduce new Covid- cases.Earlier this week, an evidence review submitted to the governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfound that face coverings could be at least half as effective as surgical masks in slowing the spread of the deadly bug. It comes after Cabinet Minister Michael Gove revealed last month that a domestic effort has been launched to produce face masks. He said the measure was intended to slow the spread of coronavirus by producing masks that limit the droplets that each of us might be responsible for. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already advised Scots to wear masks in public spaces such as shops and public transport.

Tory peer Ros Altmann, a former ­pensions minister, is leading demands for radical change to prevent a catastrophe in the “financially unsustainable” sector. She warns looking after our , care home residents is now “a game of financial pass the parcel where hedge fund companies cash in on company debts”. And she adds bluntly: “Unfortunately, the parcels are old people’s lives – there’s nothing to stop them in this system.” Covid- has claimed the lives of at least , residents so far. Baroness Altmann told the Sunday People: “It’s possible we may need to nationalise the sector. We ­cannot let these companies go bust. “They are heavily loaded with debt and unless owners are willing to put equity in – which they haven’t been – they are not financially sustainable. “This is not new and there has never been proper control over financial backing for homes. With Covid-, the sector has come crashing down because it’s not ­integrated into the health service.“The coronavirus crisis in care homes is a continuation of the broken system that has been getting worse for years. What this has done is created a disaster for the most frail and vulnerable in our society.“Their needs have not been taken with the same seriousness as the needs of the NHS. A service and NHS system has been prioritised over these people’s lives. “The idea of freeing up capacity in the NHS – sending infected older people back to care homes where the staff didn’t have enough PPE and other residents could catch it – doesn’t bear thinking about. But that is what has happened.  “It brings me to tears to think of these elderly relying on our system, at the mercy of the crisis. We’ve protected the NHS as our totemic system while social care needs have been pushed aside. Care has always been the Cinderella part of our system.” Baroness Altmann said taxpayers must foot the bill for integrating health and care – a call echoed by Labour’s former Health Secretary Andy Burnham. Writing in the New Statesman ­yesterday, Mr Burnham, now Mayor of Greater Manchester, said social care has more in common with ­insurance-led US healthcare than “British values of fairness” ­embodied by the NHS. He said: “In , I proposed a National Care Service. The problem is it would still maintain two separate systems when they need to be one.  “Now I favour social care provided on NHS terms as part of a single, fully-integrated system.” Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Our care sector is highly vulnerable and many homes are run by offshore companies. “We need social care to be put on a ­sustainable footing for the future – which is why Labour has talked about a National Care Service.”Labour pledged a National Care Service in the  election, and Boris Johnson vowed to deliver a plan to “fix the crisis” within  days of him becoming PM. That ­deadline passed in mid-March.In ,  per cent of ­residential and nursing home beds were provided by local authorities or the NHS. By  it was six per cent. Councils still covered  per cent of home care from visiting staff in  – but by  this was down to  per cent.  Critics say that since then, austerity has let private providers flood the sector. While local authorities pay a flat rate for beds for those who cannot afford care, private operators charge their own rates. For-profit companies now own ,, or . per cent, of England’s , care home beds, the IPPR think-tank found – up from  per cent in .  Labour previously pledged £.billion to buy care homes and build new ones, plus £.billion a year to run the sector. In the short-term, Baroness Altmann thinks Government bailouts may be needed, while Mr Burnham said the state should retain  per cent of a deceased person’s estate to fund care. In the longer-term, Mr Burnham believes funding should be absorbed into ­general taxation.

The Manchester doctor said drink-related incidents and violence spiked on Friday night as patients appearing to have been injured defying lockdown landed in the emergency department.Dr Ben Stewart said his team were shocked at the numbers of people requiring treatment last night and well into the early hours of this morning, reports the Manchester Evening News.He described chaotic scenes during his . hour sht, with many patients being taken to hospital for alcohol or drug related injuries.The doctor said AE had been noticeably quieter since the UKaposs lockdown was introduced, due to people avoiding hospitals because of coronavirus and less people going out drinking.But that changed last night as the long weekend kicked off with a scorching start and Brits flocked outdoors. Follow our live blog for the latest coronavirus news and updatesThe docotor said it was back to the apospre-lockdown daysapos and it appeared a lot of people had become relaxed about the restroctions. He said: The number of alcohol or drug related accidents, violence and crime rocketed last night. The police we saw said it had been their busiest night since New Year’s Eve . We knew it was going to be busier than normal. Bank Holidays are always busier. The NHS for the last four or five weeks in AE, it became a lot more quiet.  We thought we would see a bit of a peak, but it was just a shock to everybody really. The doctor said people were attending for drink-driving injuries, cars flipping over, assaults and even violent stabbings. He said there were still patients coming in with Covid- symptoms, but the majority were for drink related incidents and had attended alongside the police. Dr Stewart said: You are celebrating defeating a big enemy, but we are back in the same situation now. We need to be sensible, but people have got relaxed about it. I saw  or  patients last night, two had Covid-, one had a headache, the rest were assaults or car accidents.  All kinds of unnecessary incidents. I am hoping everybody will wake up with a bit of a hangover today and today will be better. But it is a long weekend, with a Saturday included, and I am preparing myself for the worst. It is definitely back to the pre-lockdown days. We had seen a drop in footfall with people coming in, which is good as people who are genuinely sick are getting seen at the door. People forget that we still have people coming in with coronavirus. They are taking up a lot of our resources. But it has gone back to the good old days of everyone getting drunk and relying on AE. I think in the North West we have surpassed London. We knew we would trail behind them, we have probably just peaked.  You donapost climb Everest and open few cans of beer at the top, you donapost stop until you are back at base camp. People can have a good time, but we are not through everything yet. There is still a potential second wave particularly in the North West. The doctors comments come after up to  people were seen meeting to drink champagne in Salford Quays. Footage emerged showing cars blocking the road at Media City as a group of people were spotted playing music. Residents said there were at aposleast  peopleapos present, with as many as apos peopleapos then showing up for the party from around .pm on Friday. A man was also taken to hospital with a head injury after a aposviolent disturbanceapos broke out on Mersey Bank Avenue, in Chorlton on Saturday morning.

Tensions between Downing Street and the devolved government in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland over perceived mixed messages to the public about the lockdown have emerged recently.Although Boris Johnson has previously spoken of a four-nations approach to tackling the coronavirus crisis to ensure each UK country would follow the same path, leaders have used devolution powers to step away from this.Wales, for instance, announced its garden centres would reopen from Monday. But the lockdown has been extended in Northern Ireland for a further three weeks. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hinted she wants Scotland to use its devolution powers.She warned on Thursday she would not be pressured by the Westminster Government into prematurely easing restrictions in Scotland.And she urged Scots to stick with the current coronavirus restrictions at a press conference on Friday. The politician acknowledged the four nations may need to move at dferent speeds and said the only proposed change in Scotland would be allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day. The Scottish Government said its data suggests the R-number - the average number of people an infected person can expect to pass the virus onto - is higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK.  Wales Lockdown restrictions in Wales were extended for a further three weeks on Friday, although three small adjustments are due to take effect on Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford said people would now be allowed to exercise more than once per day and garden centres could reopen as long as social distancing rules were in force.

The spot the ball competition was dreadful. For a tenner, someone could have owned it with no mortgage. It could have given someone the chance to get on the housing ladder, he said. The house was then put up for auction last September with a guide price of £,, but failed to sell again.In a fresh attempt to find a buyer, the home is now being marketed by Hunters estate agents for £,. While Powsney says he would be willing to sell to whoever meets the asking price, he believes it would be ideal for one of Boltonaposs Menaposs Shed groups. The groups are a type of community hub for men that have become increasingly important in the fight against loneliness and social isolation.

And schools will begin a phased reopening at the start of June, beginning with Year  primary leavers. But to deter those tempted to breach social distancing rules fines will be hiked from £ to £ and rise to £, for serial offenders. Garden centres, repair shops and hardware stores will be allowed to reopen from Monday. And non-contact sports such as golf and fishing are to resume soon after that. The details emerged as:The UK death toll yesterday rose  to ,. Thousands of British doctors revealed they had run out of PPE. US doctors began trialling a drug used for schizophrenia after tests showed it blocked Covid- in mice. Worrying figures showed at least  women were killed in domestic violence attacks during the first six weeks of lockdown.The PM is to give further details of his roadmap out of lockdown in a televised address to the nation at pm – after a COBRA meeting to finalise details this afternoon. His lockdown announcement in March attracted an audience of  million. A No source said: “This is a critical moment. We will proceed with maximum caution. “We must not risk a second peak which might overwhelm the NHS.” Safety guidance for workplaces will be published this week, though for most working from home will continue. Only outdoor working such as construction will be encouraged. Mr Johnson will confirm all visitors to the UK must quarantine for  days – provoking howls of anguish from aviation and tourism sectors. Commons Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper said: “It appears the Government is playing catch-up at the borders. Other countries are operating checks or isolation even while their travel numbers are low.” The plan for a staggeredof schools and colleges is to have them up and running before the summer holidays at the end of July so parents can go back to work.  But that will depend on how the Year goes. Pupils may either have to attend on alternate days or be taught in smaller groups in dferent classrooms. On the economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is now working on ending the furlough scheme which pays  per cent of the wages – up to £, a month – of the . million workers who have been laid off. He may drop the subsidy to  per cent to reduce the £billion a month bill, or allow workers to do some hours as they do in Germany, France, Sweden and Canada. The plan is to review each phase of lting of restrictions every two weeks and clamp down againinfection rates rise.  The early stages will see the NHS resume regular appointments and treatments which were abandoned when the pandemic began. Families and friends may then be allowed to meet in small groups of no more than four. Later this summer outdoor bars and cafés could reopen, along with businesses in which staff can safely keep a social distance. And more shops will be able to trade, though shopping centres are likely to remain shut. As infection rates keep going down, small weddings and baptisms will be allowed and barbers and hairdressers will be able to start work again. Cinemas and museums could open with social distancing and Premier League matches take place behind closed doors. But that prospect appalled West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson, who fears fans will gather at stadiums. He added: “I can’t see how matches could take place without signicant risk to fans, local people and brave police officers.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned at the No update that public transport will not be able to cope with ato work and people will have to walk or cycle. Andmore workers took their cars cities would soon become gridlocked. He offered rented e-scooters for the whole country instead. The Transport Secretary said social distancing on buses and trains means they will only be able to carry one in  of the passengers they usually do. He promised £billion to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists and to create bus and bike-only streets within weeks. GPs could even prescribe bicycles. And more people using them would maintain the clean air of lockdown – cutting the , annual deaths from pollution. Mr Shapps added: “This is an opportunity to make us fitter mentally and physically.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “Everyone who can work from home must continue to. For those who must travel to work, enabling more people to walk and cycle will be critical.” And David Renard, of the Local Government Association, added: “This new way of travelling is likely to become part of everyday le once the coronavirus measures are lted and beyond.” But Shadow Green Transport Minister Kerry McCarthy said: “We need a comprehensive plan to get our public transport moving again especially for those that can’t cycle to work.” Mr Shapps was asked by the Sunday Mirror how parents could cycle to work for the day before schools were fully up and running and wrap-around childcare such as breakfast and after-school clubs were available.

But after enjoying climbs in the Peak District and Snowdonia, she is now confined to home – and is determined not to let herself get rusty. Judith said: “Rock climbing always gives me this wonderful exhilarating feeling.  “There are moments when you’re scared, but not quite enough to care – just enough to get a lovely rush of adrenaline. “It’s great because it challenges my mind. It’s like a puzzle, you have to work out the best way to get yourself up a clf or climbing wall. I’m stronger and fitter than ever.” IT consultant Tim, , who shares a home with Judith, helped set up the attic adventure course. Judith added: “We were inspired by a spoof video by a well-known climber and decided to film me doing the same thing. “Tim noticed our attic could be repurposed – a sling and two karabiners later, we had something safe and exciting to try. “I perfected my single rope technique ascending and descending the beam, while we filmed the video. “It’s not quite as good as the real thing, but being able to rope down two floors is great.” "},{"url":null,"title":"greggs set reopen small number","story":"NewsGreggs set to reopen small number of stores on a trial basisFans of the Newcastle-based baker will be able to purchase their favourite products, including coffee, pasties and cakes, at an undisclosed number of shops in the Tyneside areaShareCommentsByTanveer MannDeputy News Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsGreggs is reopening a small number of stores \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The gradual reopening process has followed a series of trials with staff testing working practices while remaining shut to customers. The trial involving a restricted product range and shorter trading hours will take at least two weeks. After that, far more are set to open. Chief executive Roger Whiteside issued a statement on the firmaposs website, stressing the trials were in line with the Governmentaposs Covid- guidelines.

The home of Kevin Halligen, , was said to have been “bloodied” when he was found there on January , . Police at first treated his death as “unexplained” but coroner Richard Travers heard he died from a brain haemorrhage and that detectives found “no suspicious circumstances”. Despite being a convicted conman, the inquest recorded Mr Halligen as an “intelligence and security officer”. He ran Oakley International, which received £, of publicly donated cash after Madeleine vanished from Praia da Luz in Portugal aged three in . Halligen later denied claims the cash was siphoned off to pay for first-class travel, top hotels and a chauffeur. In , Halligen was extradited from Britain to America, where he admitted conning millions of pounds from a company whose executives had been kidnapped in Africa. He was jailed. Paramedics called to Mr Halligen’s home in Normandy, Surrey, performed CPR on him but he could not be saved. A postmortem found he died of an acute subdural haemorrhage.  A pathologist testied at Woking coroner’s court last week that there was “no sign of an assault”. His death was reported to the coroner under the name of Richard Powell.

But that’s boring. We’re lucky, because our government is much more fun. First they told us: “Changes will be introduced from Monday.” So one Conservative newspaper announced: “Hurrah! Lockdown freedom beckons.” Then they changed their mind and said nothing can change, then that there would be some change but they wouldn’t let on what it was. Next week they’ll make it a fun game where we have to guess the change. We could try going to the beach, thenwe get tear-gassed by armed police, we’ll know it isn’t that. Or there could be a  game live on BBC in which a group of ­celebrities tries to guess the new rules by asking a series of questions while clambering round an obstacle course. Eventually Davina McCall will ask “are we allowed to drink cider with our mates at a bus shelter ”, while ­clambering up a slippery ladder, then Matt Hancock will ring a bell and we’ll know that’s the new rule. With a similar spirit, when Boris Johnson was asked whether we should wear face masks, he said they “might help”. That’s the sort of clear decisive instruction we expect from a leader in a crisis. His hero Churchill was the same, when the Germans tried to invade he said: “I suppose sending some Spitfires up against them might help. I’m not sure really, it’s up to you.” At one point there was a report that schools could be reopened on May , or maybe not. This is ideal, because le is dull when you go somewhere and know for certain itaposs open. This way, parents can take their kids to school and have the excitement of not knowing whether they’ll take them in for lessons, or all get arrested for being outside at a school gate.  This follows the Prime Minister’s earlier clear guidelines, when he said he would absolutely definitely visit his mother on Mother’s Day. He was then equally clear four days later he definitely wouldn’t see his mother on Mother’s Day. But each time he was clear so that’s the main thing.

A desperate call to  confirmed her worst fears. She was told she almost certainly had Covid- and must self-isolate with husband Matt until her labour began. Yumi, , then spent eight terrying days fearing her baby would be born with the disease before being rushed to hospital when her waters broke. But after a traumatic -hour labour and a birth in which she suffered serious bleeding, she is now back home with Matt and healthy son Ori – and has tested negative for the virus. “We’re counting our blessings every minute of every day,” says Yumi. “To be home with my husband and our beautul boy, all of us healthy, is all we need.” The couple had announced the pregnancy as a surprise to their wedding guests in August last year. Yumi, of Coulsdon, Surrey, got a due date of March  and had a smooth pregnancy. But with Covid- beginning to spread in the UK in early March, she and Matt began to worry when she started feeling like she had flu. Then losing her sense of smell, a coronavirus symptom, panicked them both. “I called my midwe, who told me to call  straight away,” she says. “ I explained my symptoms and was told I had coronavirus and had to self-isolate for  days.  “But this was one day before I was due to give birth.” Her waters broke on March . The couple rushed to Croydon Hospital, South London, but were sent home for the labour to progress before Yumi was finally admitted, but not without more drama. “I was in full labour and needed midwives, but because of all the PPE and other red tape they couldn’t get to me for ages – it was all so incredibly anxious.” Ori was born on March  weighing lbs oz – but he had barely been laid on his mum’s chest before she began to bleed badly and was rushed to surgery, for emergency stitches. Meanwhile Ori was given antibiotics to ward off a suspected infection.

Simone - who was a close friend of Dianaaposs until her death in  - says the Princess fears her younger son faces disaster after deciding to step back from the royal family with his we Meghan Markle earlier this year.In her letter to William, she wrote: Diana made me promise to keep an eye on both you and Harry to make sure you’re both OK, and to give you warnings of danger signs. I am writing, actually I’m begging you, to listen because Meghan will isolate Harry, and eventually cause him to attempt radical, possibly lethal, ­self-destructive actions. If you want to respond, feel free. We MUST save Harry. The healer says she used to chat to Diana for up to  hours at a time on the phone when she was still alive and that she now makes regular appearances at her London home. Diana comes and talks to me – I see her body and she’s very animated at times. I got so fed up of it all I wrote to William, but he hasn’t responded, Simone explains. “It’s going from bad to worse. “Harry’s been separated from everything he loves – his family and his friends, including the Army boys he loved. “Diana told me Harry is feeling more and more isolated and it’s like torture for him. “Diana told me it was all going to end in disaster. Simone, who met Diana in  at the Hale Clinic in west London, warned that something was going to happen to her that would be the death of her before her death in a car crash in Paris. The psychic also predicted that Meghan was pregnant with the coupleaposs son Archie before the news was formally announced. She has previously also written to Harry, before his wedding. She added: I’m going to write one more letter to him, but I’m told he and William refuse to read correspondence from their mother’s friends because they have been told we are not to be trusted. It’s so sad as it’s the only way they will get to hear the full truth about their mother.

A group of up to  people observed Covid- social distancing rules as they gathered at a petrol station forecourt in Stretford, Manchester, where the incident took place. Mobile phone footage widely shared on social media showed an altercation on Wednesday night between a black man and two white police officers. The man is seen standing next to a marked police car and puts down his crying son before moments later he falls to the ground as a Taser is fired by one of the officers. The boy then becomes hysterical and screams daddy. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has questioned whether the Taser use was proportionate or justied and has demanded an urgent review.Greater Manchester Police has voluntarily referred the matter to the Independence Office for Police Conduct . Among the protesters at the event staged by Stand Up to Racism on Saturday were Paul Davidson, a minister at the Church of God of Prophecy.  He said: I am here because this news has outraged black people nationally. We are obviously keen to find out what the details are and whether there are other circumstances we havenapost learned from the immediate clip. Butthe immediate clip is anything to go by then people have questions to answer and we should expect answers as a community. This sort of behaviour should not be expected by anyone in a civilised society.  The man who was hit with the Taser, Desmond Ziggy Mombeyarara, , appeared before magistrates on Friday where he admitted a number of offences including speeding, drink driving, failing to stop and unnecessary travel. He denied two counts of resisting a constable in the execution of their duty and the case was adjourned to a later date. In an interview with The Times, Mr Mombeyara said he did not believe such a magnitude of force was warranted.He said his son was still in shock and thought that police had shot him. He told the newspaper: I was saying to the officers, aposLet us calm the situation for the little one because the little one doesnapost feel comfortableapos. But they were making out like I was using him as a human shield. The scene was caught on camera by an eyewitness.GMP said the incident has been reviewed by the GMP Professional Standards Branch and that they have voluntarily referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct . Superintendent Mark Kenny, commented: We are aware of public concern regarding this arrest and I want to reassure the public that this matter is being reviewed and treated seriously.In addition we have voluntarily referred this matter to the IOPC.  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has issued a statement. He said: On Friday morning , a video was brought to my attention of a police incident at a petrol station in Greater Manchester involving two police officers, a man, a child and the use of a taser. . I was concerned about what I saw and immediately asked GMP to look into it and provide me with an explanation of what had happened.

The least we deserve infrom Boris Johnson and his ministers is transparency and honesty. What we get are lies, damned lies and dodgy statistics. A political lie is the willingness to deceive. Matt Hancock promised , tests a day by the end of April. When the th arrived, the Health Secretary simply mailed out an extra , to meet his figure. It was the Covid- equivalent of a cheque in the post. And he has missed his target six days in a row. So the nation will have little confidence in Mr Johnson’s pledge of , by the end of this month. A political lie is the failure to tell the unnished truth. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick boasted of , surgical gowns from Turkey. They did not arrive next day as promised. When they did they were useless – a fact revealed by a newspaper, not the Government. A political lie is to claim there was enough PPE –and that became a damn lie as the lack of it costs lives. We are heading towards  frontline deaths. Claims that shortages were down to distribution dficulties were branded by the Enfield council leader Nesil Caliskan as “an absolute lie”. On becoming PM, Mr Johnson pledged to begin work immediately “to fix the crisis in social care once and for all”. Had he been telling the truth, care homes would not be in the desperate state they are now.  It was American writer Mark Twain who popularised the phrase “lies, damned lies and statistics”. His point was that numbers can be manipulated. No government is immune. Labour claimed it hit targets for patients to spend no longer than four hours in AE. But they were simply put in other parts of the hospital before time was up. The Tories reduced hospital waiting lists by not putting people on them. No’s daily graphs are today’s version of this sleight of hand. At first they appeared to show Covid- deaths on a similar trajectory as those in Italy, France and Spain. Only pressure to include victims outside hospitals revealed the true gruesome picture. If ministers had been straight with us we’d have known earlier we were heading for Europe’s highest toll. The statistics we do believe are of the sort compiled by the British Medical Association which show , doctors reporting no eye protection,  with no scrubs,  with no goggles and  without gloves.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This has led to some amazing acts of kindness on every street, in every village and town across the country. Communities have never felt stronger. Today, we shine a light on just some of the people from communities across the country to showcase examples of ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind and helpful things.CASE STUDYGAIL REDMONDCHARITY that supports families has noticed a sharp rise in requests for help due to widespread redundancies.Gail Redmond of Via Wings’ in the County Down town of Dromore, in Northern Ireland, says the charity normally gives out  food bags a month to people in need.“But last week we gave out  already, many of which are going to people who are self-isolating,” she said.“One guy who contacted me on Friday, said: I have never asked anyone for help like this before. But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards. He set a target of £ on his JustGiving page and has raised more than £ already.Leeds Cares is the official charity partner of Leeds Teaching Hospitals. The organisation supports NHS staff to deliver the best care for patients and their families, by raising funds for equipment, services, education and research.Leeds Cares works collaboratively with all of the hospitals across Leedsto identy charitable projects and causes.CASE STUDYSTENHOUSEMUIR FCHOME ADVANTAGE: Stenhousemuir players brought food directly to people’s houses.A FOOTBALL club initiative is supporting hundreds of families by delivering school meals to pupils during the coronavirus lockdown.With the season shut down indefinitely, Stenhousemuir FC set up its community help hotline in mid-March to assist the most vulnerable members of society as the effects of the global pandemic began to take hold.A -strong squad of volunteers was assembled in the first week to carry out everyday tasks like shopping or dog walking for those in isolation or for whom such activities would prove dficult. Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends.

Premium shellfish ndashbrown crab to China, scallops to Italy, langoustines to Spain ndash has also been despatched abroad as soon as it was landed.Once these exports, and the chefsrsquo orders, were syphoned off, that left many retail fishmongersrsquo slabs selling a predictable choice, heavily reliant on familiar species, notably haddock, padded out with farmed fish. Enter coronavirus. Restaurant orders stopped overnight, export chains broke down. But instead of tying up boats and facing financial ruin, some determined fishermen, operating smaller boats closer to shore, have started exploring local markets, on the quayside, via direct boat-to-door home deliveries, or at the fishmongers.As Nick Underdown, campaigner at Open Seas, the charity that promotes sustainable alternatives to damaging fishing, puts it: ldquoSome of our tremendous, sustainably caught seafood that was previously shipped abroad is now actually available. Hurrah!Itrsquos heartening to see our seafood supply chain localising, but what happened to species ersity  In Cornwall and Devon fishermen are concentrating on the local market too, and they are lucky to have an abundance of fish available from smaller boats: lemon sole, cod, plaice, hake, megrim, turbot, as well as shellfish. Scotlandrsquos fleet, on the other hand, has become highly reliant on monocultures, for example scallops dredged asploughing a field, which destroys the breeding grounds for other fish.Efforts are being made to make these fisheries more selective, but unfortunately some fisheries still net huge amounts of ldquobycatch, and often very small fish, meaning that young fish never get the chance to grow and breed. A further issue is that many fisheries around Scottish shores have not recovered from decades of overfishing. For instance, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommends that there is lsquono catchrsquo of cod on the west coast. Other sources insist that there are viable cod fisheries in the North Sea. Some fishmongers sell this catch, supplied predominantly from bigger boats that land direct to our whitefish port hubs: Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and to a lesser degree Scrabster, Lochinver, and Kinlochbervie.Here are some fishmongers, local cooperatives, and small commercial operators doing local sales.I canrsquot vouch for the sustainability credentials of all their products. Many sell the ubiquitous farmed salmon, and dredged scallops. There are few unambiguously local and sustainable sources as yet.But now that coronavirus has depth-charged our fishermen, they need our support.

Hersquos mortied about taking our money though, and is only convinced to accept it when the councillor promises to come to his door ldquoafter Mass on Sunday night. He seems more relaxed now and says that we are a pair of ldquogood c**ts. As the taxi arrives he asks uswersquore behaving ourselves and, with a twinkle in his eye, entreats us to look after ourselves. He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.:Giovanna Eusebi shares memories of cooking with her grandmother in lockdown recipe seriesldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in. And we fans of Greenock Morton FC take enormous pride in the fact that when it came to the crunch, we fought to keep our club back in . The local community support came to the fore then. But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre. A tennis club, a private school and a fancy hotel sit just a few streets away from the corner that houses five betting shops. ldquoFrom a planning perspective, says Councillor McEleny, ldquoyou have to ask how we allowed a system that allowed the town centre to be hollowed out and then filled with franchises and chains and the practice of permitting the bookies to take up all the empty shop spaces.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Giovanna Eusebis lockdown family feast recipes for you to tryYet, he refuses to dwell on the glories of Greenockrsquos shipbuilding past and the well-paid jobs that made this place thrum with productivity and economic health. Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this. Scotlandrsquos new Social Security hubs in Glasgow and Dundee are providing  jobs. Most of these are relatively high-paying, skilled jobs and would have made much more of a dference in Greenock than in Glasgow city centre. He salutes the Greenock , the much-loved local newspaper which has been chronicling and supporting the town for  years. ldquoLike many other local papers, they could have moved to the outskirts, but theyrsquore still here in the heart of the town centre. Itrsquos a very powerful symbol of solidarity and much appreciated around here.ldquoNeither Santander or Scottish Power are going to build large facilities here but our public sector has the ability to do this. Cities must accept thatwe want thriving towns which feed the cities then wersquove got to start doing things dferently or these communities and ones like Bute and the Western Isles are just going to keep depopulating.For those of us who live in and around cities itrsquos easy to forget that smaller and more far-flung places all need the same level of services: the bins still need to be picked up education and policing still has to be provided. But with fewer people yoursquove got less taxation to pay for it. The economic model is broken but it could be fixed with a little imagination.ldquoAny time a developer wants to build new houses therersquos supposed to be a mix to promote social cohesion. But the developers get round this by offering little parcels of land cheaply for social housing so that they donrsquot spoil their fancy developments with it. This creates social ision.Coronavirus has now rendered the recent multi-deprivation statistics obsolete. Inverclyde now has the highest death rate in the country due to the disease according to the latest National Records of Scotland statistics. The region has had  deaths per , people, a figure nearly three times that of the death rate in the least deprived areas. In neighbouring East Renfrewshire itrsquos  per , and in East Dunbartonshire itrsquos currently .This pandemic, like all the others before it, preys on the poor. We like to think of Scotland as a progressive country, inclusive of all. Yet, in the numbers that gather around le and death nothing really changes for the people who live out of sight and beyond the limits of our imagination and compassion."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11347005.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ve-day-75-memories-unite-lockdown-scotland","story":"Also at pm, thousands of people will stand up and raise a toast: ldquoTo those who gave so much, we thank you.It wasnrsquot supposed to be this way though.Camleys Cartoon: VE Day .There were supposed to be church services and public parades and street parties.

It was a day of great rejoicing. In Stoneyburn, bonfires were lit in every street and crowds gathered round them and sang into the wee sma hours.There were similar scenes all over Scotland. In Perth, the bells of the churches began to peel immediately after Churchillrsquos broadcast.In Falkirk, a pipe band paraded through the town. And in Greenock, there was singing and dancing in the streets.But the biggest party was in Glasgow. Crowds flowed in and out of George Square from pm until well after midnight. Many danced in front of the City Chambers.Fireworks were let off. Children and soldiers climbed on the statues. The pubs had to close early because there was no more beer left, but the party went on anyway.Reporting on the celebrations, The Glasgow Herald called it a robust and joyful night.ldquoNoise, the sort of gay, grappling, carefree merry making, the sound of which has not been heard of in Glasgow in the s, came back to town, said the report.ldquoYou could hear it half a mile away. It was solid and heartwarming.ldquoA party of able seamen took the notion to ride bareback on one of the equestrian statues in George Square. They contented themselves with hanging on to the stirrups when it was pointed out to them that their combined weight might topple horse and rider from the pedestal. Later they achieved their ambition and got astride the bronze horse.The Herald also reported how a Dutch sailor climbed on top of the statue that would later become famous as a resting place for traffic cones ndash the Duke of Wellington statue in Royal Exchange Square ndash and did an impersonation of Hitler.ldquoAn admiring crowd applauded his buffoonery, said The Herald.ldquoIt was equally responsive when he made a short speech in broken English and thanked ldquothe Scots for the brave part they had played in the liberation of his country.In London, the celebrations were on an even bigger scale. Some , people gathered at Buckingham Palace to see the first of several balcony appearances by the King and Queen and princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. Famously, the princesses later slipped out and mingled anonymously with the people.At pm, pretty much everything stopped for Churchillrsquos speech to the nation and it was a warning just as much as it was a celebration.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, he said, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad.Historian Derek Patrick, who lectures in history at St Andrews University, says it is important to remember Churchillrsquos words and that in many ways VE Day represented a continuation rather than a change.ldquoRealistically, there was no sea change ndash nothing changed overnight, said Mr Patrick.ldquoYou would start to see POWs ing to the country but it took a long long time to get things back on an even keel and towards normality.ldquoThere was also a level of hostility and resentment ndash a feeling that people were promised a land fit for heroes but it was a  dawn. After years of war, there was perhaps a determination to see this project through and you can attribute a lot of the changes we saw after VE Day, like the NHS, to the war. This is a moment to rejoice ndash Europe has been pulled back from the precipice ndash but this is only one step on the road to victory.Catherine Drummond certainly remembers how tough it was after VE Day. She was a war widow with an eight-month-old daughter and had to work two jobs, in a shop and waiting tables, to make ends meet. She was also still mourning her husband.ldquoIt took me a long time to get over it, she said. ldquoI didnrsquot really give up hope until the POWs came home.

Scotland had been subjected to  German air raids. Homes and families were destroyed. And widows and widowers were made. The country was exhausted and the political, social and economic repercussions would be felt for many years to come.But perhaps, says Mr Patrick, it is even more important to mark this anniversary than the ones that have gone before ndash for a simple and poignant reason. ldquoThe opportunities to speak to the people who were there, he says, ldquoare slipping away."},{"url":null,"title":"yu-ca-taco-glasgow-ron-mackennas-home-delivery-review-impressive-mexican","story":"And I get this reply: ldquoHiya, we close orders for delivery on Wednesday evening, The man adds: ldquoBit of a weird business model, I know.Actuallyhellipnowadays, muchacho, itrsquos not that weird.

The First Minister has mostly managed to strike the right tone from the beginning when she said the virus was a reminder that in a crisis, the issues that ide us are no longer quite so important.Her briefing this week, following leaks to the media by the UK government on plans to be announced by Boris Johnson tomorrow on easing lockdown, was an impressive performance. Ms Sturgeon said she was open to relaxing some rules on exercising outdoors, but warned it could be catastrophic to drop the ldquostay at home message. The firm tone was well judged given the mooted ergence on the current pan-UK strategy it was not an exaggeration, said Ms Sturgeon, that the decisions taken now were a matter of le and death.A precipitate exit from lockdown risks triggering a rise in cases. As the FM said: extreme caution is required.Ms Sturgeonrsquos refusal to openly criticise the PM or the UK Government even though she had not been briefed on the plans they leaked to the media was to her credit. Some have accused her of trying to draw dferences between Edinburgh and London for political purposes, but in fact the whole of the UK went into lockdown together and, by and large, the governments have worked in tandem. This is no time for a constitutional bun-fight.In urging caution over lockdown, Ms Sturgeon has also proved herself politically astute. Over the last few days, we have seen aof some of the PMrsquos bullish enthusiasm ndash some of the lockdown measures could start to be lted from Monday, he said. Hawkish Tories are also suggesting a quick easing of restrictions.In urging caution, Ms Sturgeon has made any rush towards an ease of lockdown much more dficult she has also emphasised how poorly the UK Government is handling this latest stage of the information campaign. The leaks that suggested we might soon be allowed to go to the park or the beach to sunbathe or have a picnic betrayed a disgraceful lack of discipline within the UK Government. Unlike the ldquostay at home message, the leaks are also likely to cause confusion among the public.It is signicant that, after Ms Sturgeonrsquos briefing, the UK Government started to dial down on the rhetoric. Hopefully, they understand that pushing a policy without appearing to properly consult the devolved administrations shows a lack of respect for devolution.A spokesperson for the PM also reiterated that he was committed to a UK-wide approach, although both the PM and the FM have said it is possible the four nations may go dferent waysthey are at dferent stages.Such a multi-speed approach could be entirely logical. Coronavirus can behave dferently in dferent countries and can y within countries, which means there could be good reasons for dferences in the response across the UK. What it must not mean, though, is that we start to confuse the message on coronavirus. If we are all in this together, we all need clear, careful and consistent advice.Why we rememberOn May th, , people across Britain celebrated VE Day communally. Seventy-five years on, because of coronavirus, we are forced to mark the anniversary in a dferent way. But we can still remember. Some people worry about vainglory, but really itrsquos about stopping to think about the extraordinary endurance of the men and women who belonged to the war generation. The ones who were killed. The ones who became widows and widowers and orphans. The ones who thought it would never end. Seventy-five years ago, they celebrated the end of it all but they also mourned. We can do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-kevin-mckenna-must-put-people-profit","story":"I spoke recently to a secondary head-teacher who told me that his school ndash and many others ndash are preparing for serious challenges in dealing with the mental and physical impact of coronavirus on his pupils. This, he suggested, will last for many years. Several health professionals have told me that the long-term psychological damage of coronavirus on iniduals and families is what you might associate with surviving a war. Anyone who thinks wersquoll be meeting lsquonormalityrsquo any time soon is deluding himself.Schools, especially those with a high quotient of disadvantaged pupils, will be required to provide a full suite of social services. To an extent, this had always been part of their duty of care. In the years ahead though, this will become their primary . At this stage we canrsquot easily put a figure on the number of children affected by parents losing their jobs or struggling with overwhelming debt. The word lsquounprecedentedrsquo is now the most common in the pandemic lexicon and it fits here too. And we can only guess at what other iniquities many children will have been forced to witness.Itrsquos almost unbearable to imagine what terrors many women and children are currently experiencing. Last week, Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic abuse charity, Nia, reported that domestic violence killings have more than doubled during the lockdown. Ms Ingala Smith has been monitoring the numbers of women killed by men in the UK for an annual femicide census and has identied at least  suspected domestic abuse killings occurring between March  and April .Ms Ingala Smith said the number of women killed by men in the first three weeks of lockdown is the highest for  years. We also know the communities in which this apocalypse is most prevalent. According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest statistics, these places are seeing coronavirus death rates three times worse than in affluent neighbourhoods.After lockdown, as society hurries to re-locate order, the money-changers will be found at the head of the throng. Yet,the countrys primary focus is on the recovery of its people then corporations and commerce police and judiciary must also be encouraged to change dramatically the way they go about their business. To borrow another locution from the coronavirus glossary, this should happen in lsquolocksteprsquo with the programme of welfare that will be requiredwe are serious about the post-pandemic recovery.Weve all warmed to the acts of kindness and compassion which have made the lockdown more bearable. The true worth of our claims to be a lsquodecentrsquo country fit for heroes will lie in how our civic authorities and our corporate giants treat people.The Government was very quick to create emergency legislation to provide an aid package to preserve jobs. Something similar must be enacted to ensure large companies with big profits dont hide behind coronavirus to dispense with their workers. This perhaps will be an early test of Keir Starmerrsquos credentials to lead the Labour Party. Following the  banking crisis countless large companies treated their employees as mere collateral damage. It didnrsquot matter that their huge profits would soon recover in time in the short term the ravenous demands of their shareholders had to prevail.Greenock and Stockbridge: A tale of two Scotlands under coronavirusThe Royal Bank of Scotlandwas considered by the UK Government to be too big to fail and public cash was found to save it. It repaid the nationrsquos largesse by establishing its Global Restructuring Group to locate and hunt down small and medium-sized businesses menace them into liquidation and then gorge themselves on the assets for a song. It was a scandal.In pre-coronavirus times large firms who felt pressured into morality would blackmail the country by warning us thattoo many regulations and controls were imposed on them theyd have to up sticks and relocate where. Aye, well good luck to themthey attempt to pull that one now...In times of crisis we are all urged to pull together and channel our inner Dunkirk. We all fall in quickly. It soon emerges, though, that the new rules rarely apply to the corporate world. In the US those banks tasked with disbursing cash intended to relieve small businesses chose instead to favour their large corporate clients. The relief programme was intended to give emergency loans to firms as an inducement to businesses not to ditch their employees. It ran out of money last week because the larger firms were served first. More than  of these firms, some with market values of more than  million, received a combined million in loans.We saw something of this last month in the UK as multi-million-pound firms with massive profits moved with remarkable haste to avail themselves of the Government furlough scheme. This money tree canrsquot maintain such windfalls indefinitely. A time will come when the Government must move to protect the employees when the directors revert to their base instincts.We too easily swallow the pernicious fiction of capital that entrepreneurs are our sole wealth-providers. In this wersquore told that they live to provide jobs from the wells of goodness that spring in their saintly hearts. Aye, right. The reality is thatmany of them could find a way of amassing profits without having to use workers at all theyrsquod regard it as the golden ticket.In the years ahead we will be urged to alter our behaviours and to get with the new reality. This must apply to the corporations too. They must be made to assist in the national recovery programme by putting people at the heart of their enterprises before profits.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was announced yesterday that the Scottish Government would pass this funding along in full to Scottish councils.Council leaders appealed to the Scottish Government through COSLA, which represents local authorities in Scotland, to give the funding directly to Scottish councils immediately to help them provide essential services at a time when costs are increasing signicantly and income has dropped substantially due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking following yesterday#s announcement, councillor Stockan said: “The announcement from the Scottish Government has shown the value in council leaders working on a common cause together at a time of crisis to press the Scottish Government to give us the support we so badly need and deserve. The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though. There is more funding that should be available to us and we will continue to fight for that. Local councils are facing unprecedented dficulties.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3102034.jpg--.jpg?1588582662000\n","title":"parcels delivered by ballee community association","story":"Ballee Community Association have played their part in helping the commuity during the COVID crisis.The Association were awarded pound funding from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and then match funded pound from their own reserve funds to make  emergency parcels for older residents in Ballee.

I think those things can be looked at... but what is important is the regulations are put in place for another three weeks. Mrs Foster said she spoke to Mr Johnson on Thursday, and he said he was moving forward with maximum caution. He, and I as well, want us to move forwardwe can in a four-nations way, she said. Because when we do that we have a simplicity of message, we have a clarity of message, and people really understand what#s really going on when we move together as a bloc. Yesterday, on a visit to Dungannon, Ms O#Neill repeated calls for an all-island approach to exiting lockdown.She said the message, for now, remained to stay at home - but indicated plans for a loosening of restrictions would be made public in the coming days.Ms O#Neill added: We said we will publish an exit strategy and it will be here by the start of the week.Every action we take, we won#t know the impact for a few weeks. People want to know in June and July they#ll be able to do #x,y,z# and I want to hopefully be in a position to give that information at the start of the week.Ms O#Neill said that regardless of what Mr Johnson outlines tomorrow, the message here was the same. She added: My message is very clear. Stay at home for the next three weeks. We#re going to have an exit strategy to give us all some hope for the future. We live on an island, We need to work together across the island. It makes good common sense. The disease is spreading across the island at the very same rate. It#s important we work together as best we that we can and we have to recognise the fact hat the disease doesn#t stop at the border.At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Eustice said the Prime Minister will set out a road map tomorrow about how the current restrictions can evolve. He said the four nations are all working together to try to have a broadly similar approach.Mr Eustice said the UK is not out of the woods and that the UK will live with the virus for some time to come. He said: We will have to wait for what the Prime Minister has to say on Sunday but I think what I can say is this - he#s going to set out effectively a road map of how we can evolve the current restrictions. We have this complete lockdown at the moment to something where certain activities may become possible in the short-term, in the near term and other things might take much longer. We have to be realistic that there isn#t going to be dramatic overnight change, we will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have, as the data we#re outlining on a daily basis shows we are not out of the woods. There are still major challenges, we will be living with this virus for some time to come and it#s therefore important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our NHS.

The care the staff at Bradley Manor gave her helped her stay where she wanted to be. We just can#t thank them enough for all that they have done these past few weeks. Coronavirus still knocked her back a good bit and, given her age, the recovery is slow, but we all take it in turns to FaceTime her every day. She might not be up to date with technology, but the staff in Bradley Manor have been fantastic in helping her. She loves nothing more than seeing her great-grandchildren. All the family have been there for her in whatever way we can.None of us have actually seen her since the home closed to visitors in the middle of March. While we did have plans to celebrate her birthday at Belfast Castle and let her look down over the city she loves so much, we#ve obviously had to put any big family gatherings on hold until the situation changes.But we have been in touch with Bradley Manor and we#re all hoping to be there in the car park next week to see her on her birthday.Though she#s in bed most of the time recovering, the staff are hoping to get her down to reception and wheel her to the door so she can see all of us.Birthday cards can be sent to Ethel, addressed Bradley Manor,  Crumlin Road, BT GEBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While lockdown restrictions continue, the number of people using bus and rail services to get to work has been increasing in recent weeks.Davy Thompson, Unite Deputy Regional Secretary, told the Belfastthat more certainty was also needed on funding and on arrangements for cross-border services.Whilst the lockdown may be eased, the reality is that a lot of companies are going back to work and more people are using public transport, he said.Therefore we believe it should be mandatory for passengers to wear face coverings. All the drivers are behind protective screens but our concern would be for our conductors, they can have masks but it should be required.On north-south journeys, he questionedconductors could be asked to police dferent regulations as they crossed the border.He added: We believe that to be completely unfair and it just needs to be standardised across the whole of Ireland.Mr Thompson said that Translink#s resources had fallen signicantly in recent weeks, adding: There has been money sent to Stormont for Covid-, but I#m not aware that the department has got anything out of that at this point.He added that maintaining social distancing could mean it is necessary to run two buses for certain services. Social distancing currently means that capacity is limited to no more than % on buses and % on trains.Ms Mallon said she had been clear with Executive colleagues that Translink must be properly resourced.She also warned that using face coverings should not lead to a  sense of security, and social distancing should still be maintained during journeys.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said his Government provides funding for food banks.What we do not do is post on Facebook pictures of our ministers visiting them and handing out food to the poor, he added.Mrs O#Neill, on a visit to Dungannon yesterday, accused Mr Varadkar of engaging in party politics.Leo Varadkar#s policy and Fine Gael#s policy will always be akin to a Tory policy, she said.I believe that his comments were unbefitting of even a caretaker Taioseach. I#ll make no apology for any Sinn Fein minister, or any minister for that matter, looking after those people who need them right now, people who are shielding, people who can#t get out to buy their own food. So Leo#s comments are more about party politics and the fact that he wants to try and form a government at the exclusion of Sinn Fein.Earlier Sinn Fein Stormont Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the Taoiseach#s comments were ill-judged.I think he is rattled from the last election and the success of the Sinn Fein vote there, she told the BBC#s Good Morning Ulster. I think this is part of his continued pursuit of excluding Sinn Fein from government formation and I think it has to be put into context of government formation talks are going on at the moment.What Leo doesn#t add, because he shares the same politics as the Tories, is  years of Tory austerity and the impact that has had on our health service in responding to this pandemic.Ms Hargey said that she was very proud as Communities Minister to be involved in giving out more than , food parcels to those in need during the pandemic.In the Dail the Taoiseach and Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald clashed over the €-per-week Covid- pandemic unemployment payment.Sinn Fein ministers on their Facebook site promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor, reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean Leo VaradkarMr Varadkar responded to Ms McDonald by highlighting that payments for the unemployed are far lower in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Fein is in power.He suggested the rates were so low that Sinn Fein ministers were forced to deliver food parcels.Sinn Fein ministers on their Facebook site promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor, reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean, he said.I would be ashamed to do something like that. Do not blame it on the Tories and do not blame it on London. If it was not for their money, it would be even worse, he added.In response Sinn Fein highlighted pictures on Twitter showing Irish Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy delivering meals on wheels to his constituents. Mr Murphy retweeted the images to his own Twitter account.Ms McDonald said she was very proud of the community work her members do across the country.It is not just in the North that people are running meals on wheels and bringing packages and parcels to help people who are struggling, she said.Belfast Most ReadSinn Fein: Leo Varadkar#s food parcels jibe is just cheap politicking I am remorseful, says former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt as he quits role at Stormont after flouting lockdown rules Incident the latest headline for Mike Nesbitt, a man rarely far from the spotlightMP Little-Pengelly tight-lipped over her #Pride# tweet as party says it has no issue with the wordsAncient Red Hand symbol of Ulster still has power to ide Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Speaking at the daily COVID- briefing, she said work is ongoing on a ‘roadmap to recovery’ with all departments and those efforts will continue over the coming days. There will be no alterations to lockdown restrictions at the moment as the Executive believes they are still necessary. To build ‘confidence’, the Executive has agreed that the public consider the use of ‘face coverings’ for ‘short periods in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not possible’. She stressed the dference between face masks used in clinical settings and face coverings which are currently made by people at home from clothing items for use in day to day le – ‘we are focused on face coverings’. googletag.cmd.push The decision is based on scientic advice from UK government advisors in the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

Michael McMullan tells the story of the Park mans soccer career... *** The weekends were always about football for Gerry McElhinney. Right from the beginning. And as much as he could possibly squeeze in. Gaelic football or soccer, it didnt matter. In January , in his mid-teens, he set off from the family home under the slopes of Sawel mountain. He walked a mile down the Barnes Road. Boots and gear at the ready, hed rest against the wall of the bridge in Park. googletag.cmd.push It was the start of a regular occurrence, waiting on the recently-formed Dungiven Celtic to collect him for the first game of a soccer career that would take him to Celtic, a career in England and the cusp of the  European Championships. “I used to walk down from Dreen, because you would never have found it, it was a little farm,” McElhinney begins. His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In a report by senior council officers brought before a special meeting of the council, it was stated that the council is currently incurring losses of around pound, per month as a result of the closure of facilities and services. The local authority is also having to cope with additional waste management costs and exceptional emergency expenditure as a result of the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push The council report stated: This will likely be worsened following the first quarter as the impact of the pandemic hits Council’s rate-base and the current rates relief scheme for business comes to an end. Whilst a regional bid is currently being considered by Central Government, this has not yet been confirmed and may only part fund some of the financial loss being incurred. At this point, it is therefore clear that reserves will not be adequate to fund Council services for the year ahead and Council will be in a position of insolvency by September .  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Foyle Martina Anderson said several caravan owners have spoken to her about having to pay fees despite not being able to use their caravans. “It was the right decision to close caravan parks, given the obvious dangers of people staying together in such close proximity during this pandemic, said Ms Anderson. “It is however unfair to expect all caravan owners, many of whom have seen their incomes affected, to continue to pay a pitch fee while they have no access to their caravan. googletag.cmd.push “Park owners need to take into account the circumstances that many caravan owners are facing during these dficult times. “They should therefore consider reducing or waiving annual and partial fees given that owners are unlikely to be able to access their caravans during the summer months at least. “Rather that park owners collaborating to force caravan owner to pay their site fees regardless of the impact of this deadly pandemic, they should be uniting in their call on the Irish Government to put financial support in place to ensure that neither caravan owners or park owners are penalised as a result of this pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff.

However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear.

Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park

accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the

The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so.

Also, much of the public sector is non frontline, yet unscathed by this crisis, while almost everyone  faces some hardship : User A week later, everyone in JPI Media,the News Letter owner, was told a pay cut was being imposed.No-one was surprised by the chief executive David King’s announcement. Other media groups had already done the same, and furloughedmore people than JPI did.In our case, no-one earning £, has had a pay cut, and above cuts were graduated all the way up to the top, with Mr King and the best paid executives losing %.No-one was thrilled about the cut but I heard no complaint. We respected the symbolism of the tiering, so that the best paid lost most.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We have all learned a lot since then about Covid- and the impact of measures to halt it.One thing I have learned is a concept of Total Harm Minimisation, which means measuring the entirety of harm after a certain course of action. For example, forcing people to stay home might stop Covid- but cause other problems that are as bad or maybe worse. So you need to measure all costs and benefits.That will take years of careful examination of data. No doubt when results emerge not all the experts will agree on what they mean.My own emerging sense is that this first wave of the virus is nothing like as bad as it might have been, that this is not just due to lockdown – and that evenit was, the unintended consequences of lockdown might be as bad as the benefits.But that is only my sense [possible reasons why are given at the end of this article]. We all make our own judgments. My point in this column is the utterly uneven way that people are suffering from lockdown.This is nobody’s fault — no-one planned for restaurants to be destroyed and supermarkets boom.No-one decided that some people would be stuck in flats, and others in houses with large gardens. Butthis is going to go on and on, and some politicians almost scold us when they imply it will, then we need a new concept called, let us say, Total Harm Distribution.At present the economic harm distribution is wildly unbalanced.One long-term solution is to have a careful look at who is paid what.Most people think low paid key workers get a raw deal and there has been cross-party awareness of this. The  Labour government brought in a minimum wage, the  Tory-Lib one boosted it . It is easy to call for rises, but who pays for it  In an ideal world white collar workers, people like journalistsin an office, might face a pay trim to help fund manual workers.Butthis crisis goes on another subset of issues must be addressed. Leaders of private companies are taking big pay cuts, so perhaps public sector leaders and politicians will too  Many of the latter say lockdownis here to stay in the short term.I have written unpopular articles suggesting we pay politicians more , to attract talent. But there could be a temporary symbolic cut.And what about the swathes of the public sectorwho areunscathed by this crisis, while almost everyone  faces some sacrice  Few civil servants are frontline.In the same way that lists of essential businesses were drawn up, perhaps the same should be done for frontline NHS and key staff, who get a temporary bonus, while non essential public sector have a pay trim to help the national effort.There have been problems getting technology so that all civil servants can work at home, which is understandable given global demand on laptops, but it does suggest that some people have been at home for weeks on full pay. I put this to Stormont – they say that the “vast majority” are “working in line with latest guidance” It was political cowardice that Stormont went ahead with the teacher a pay rise, while sending out signals that schools will not reopen until September, and possibly only in a phased way even then.Memories are fading of the financial disaster in the s, when unions dictated pay, leading the UK to the International Monetary Fund.Meanwhile, appeal judges in Belfast last week put pressure on the attorney general to hold yet another inquest into a Troubles death where state failure is alleged .When people and businesses face ruin and when key workers are risking their health amid a shortage of protection gear, some of this taxpayer-funded expenditure is merely an insult.But some of it is an outrage. • Some reasons to be concerned at the grave harmof lockdown:There are, according to the Office for National Statistics, , unexplained excess deaths per week, in addition to , excess Covid deaths — a total of , excess deaths, which means deaths that above the average for a typical week at this time of year. It might ultimately be that the non Covid deaths are of people who are notably younger than the Covid patients who are dying, who have an average age of +, and many of whom were already gravely ill. We can speculate on about five likely types of non Covid deaths caused by lockdown: • Suicide .• Premature deaths from chronic loneliness of people who had little social contact before this crisis and now have none, or chronic stress of people who have lost jobs or are confined in an unhappy household .• Deaths from conditions that are not getting the treatment they normally do: heart, cancer, stroke.• Deaths from a depression plunging people around the world into poverty, reducing le expectancy. These latter deaths will take many years to show in statistics.• I asked the Department of Financeit was true thate some civil servants been at home for weeks on full pay with nothing to do  If so, is it a large number. Are there plans to change that  Andso, how will it change  When A Department of Finance spokesperson replied:“During the Covid- pandemic the vast majority of civil servants have continued to work in line with the latest guidance, either attending their workplaces safely or working remotely.“Civil servants have provided services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Departments have redeployed staff to deliver priority work.“The Civil Service have been working over the past two years to change the way it works providing staff with the flexibility to work remotely. Services and working practices will continue to evolve in the future with more digital services coming online to serve citizens ensuring that staff can work efficiently from remote locations.”• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry in : If we want better politicians we might have to pay them more• News Letter home delivery service is expanded—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In anticipation of what none of us wants to hear, politicians at Westminister got an earful from no less a person than Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, who warned there could be ‘social unrest’the over s are ‘forced to endure a longer lockdown than the younger generation’.This is a country where once upon a time women could retire at  and men at  – as that was regarded as old age. But people have been living longer due to better living standards, the results of all the hard work the baby boomer generation put in right up to the present time. This appears to have emboldened successive Governments to raise the age of retirement age for both men and women. More money in the public coffers is the result.

Putting up the age of retirement also means there will be less years for state pensions to be paid out.I worry at what appears to be the increasing use of the term ‘healthy over s’. What exactly does that mean  Few people in this age category I suspect enjoy perfect health, otherwise GPs across the land wouldn’t be advising them to take statins to keep blood pressure levels down. Women have been encouraged to take HRT long after menopause, even staying on it for leneeds be. These le enhancers, as some medical people appear to regard them, may be just the ticket. But how are we to know since the latter, statins, are relatively new to the people whilst HRT still attracts controversy Do either of these treatments increase longevity  We simply don’t know the answer to that question.Locking down the over-s, many of whom will still be paying tax to the Government, could be interpreted in many ways. I will take the kindly approach and suggest that the Government will need all the scope it has to get the economy back up and running schools will have to be re-opened and plans will have to be laid for the possibility of a future pandemic since the current one caught everyone by surprise and left the country on its knees. With the absolute necessity to get people back to work and paying income tax, the Government must have thought the oldies could wait and since many of them will have ious ailments it could be dressed up as ‘protecting them’. One Cabinet minister has said the whole thing ‘is to be based around consent rather than compulsion’.That’s fine, but it appears no one asked us first whether we wanted to be lockdowned for longer or left to do our own thing.I certainly do not want to be on lockdown for any more weeks than I have to because once you hit your s le seems to go by in a flash. It seems no time since my children were clinging to my skirts wanting me to play in the garden. Anniversaries and birthdays came and went with me so busy I scarcely noticed. The children grew up with me hardly noticing the years go by and then they were off to university. They found themselves wives, leaving us at home, on our own, wondering where all the years had gone. But still we felt young, still able to work and go on holiday.We hardly noticed our th birthdays, then last year it was the th wedding anniversary. We still have brothers and sisters and the only recognition of ageing is when the much older members in the wider family, the true older generation, pass on.
