He has now been removed from his roleHis arrest stunned the car industry and the business world and has plunged an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi motors, which he forged, into doubt.Nissan board members voted unanimously to sack  Ghosn as chairman, the Japanese car giant said in a statement on Thursday.The statement said: \u0027After reviewing a detailed report of the internal investigation, the board voted unanimously ... to discharge Carlos Ghosn as Chairman of the Board.\u0027The claims against Ghose come after a month-long internal Nissan probe following a whistleblower report.UN environment chief quits after he is accused of \u0027obscene...Cult leader is jailed for 15 years in South Korea for raping...Share this articleHours after his arrest, his hand-picked successor as CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, launched an impassioned broadside at his former mentor, muttering about a \u0027dark side\u0027 to the Ghosn era and urging his sacking.However, even after being removed as chairman, Ghosn remains  a member of the board as a full shareholders\u0027 meeting is required to remove him.Ghosn is seen as being responsible for the revival of Nissan, as well as the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, which sold a combined 10.6 million cars last year - more than any other firm.The alliance, which employs 450,000 people globally, is now thought to be under threat as Ghosn was believed to be the glue holding it together.  His sacking comes after he was arrested for financial irregularities. Ghosn is being held in spartan conditions at a Tokyo detention centre (pictured)The disgraced boss is being held in custody in a Tokyo detention centre and has not been seen in public nor made any comments since his arrest.He received a visit from Brazilian consul Joao de Mendonca on Thursday who told AFP that Ghosn \u0027sounded very well, in good health\u0027.However, his conditions are likely to be a far cry from what the millionaire businessman is used to. Inmates at the centre are typically allowed 30 minutes exercise per day and only two baths a week.Ties and strings are removed to prevent suicide attempts and former guards and lawyers said Ghosn was almost certain to be held in a cramped cell on his own.On Wednesday, prosecutors successfully applied to extend his custody for an additional 10 days as they step up their questioning.Deputy chief prosecutor Shin Kukimoto said that the type of crime Ghosn is accused of is \u0027one of the most serious types of crime\u0027 under Japan\u0027s Financial Instruments Act and Ghosn could face a 10-million-yen fine andor a 10-year prison sentence.Under the law, companies themselves can be held accountable for the falsified documents,  following reports that prosecutors believe Nissan also has a case to answer.  The crisis appeared to be going from bad to worse for Nissan, as the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that prosecutors believe the firm also had a case to answer. Both Nissan and the authorities declined to commentPublic broadcaster NHK said Nissan had paid \u0027huge sums\u0027 to provide Ghosn with luxury homes in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam \u0027without any legitimate business reason\u0027.Ghosn had a reputation as a hard-nosed workaholic with no qualms about closing factories and slashing jobs -- earning the nickname \u0027Le Cost Killer\u0027 in France, where 47,000 employees work for Renault.But his exorbitant salary and flashy lifestyle - at odds with Japanese corporate culture - has long been criticised.According to the Financial Times, Ghosn\u0027s fall from grace came as he was working on a full-blown merger of Nissan and Renault. Ghosn\u0027s departure could now be used as a pretext to rebalance the alliance in Nissan\u0027s favour, according to reports.Renault has held off on removing Ghosn, saying that Nissan had failed to share the evidence it had gathered with its sister company.Governments in Paris and Tokyo have been scrambling to contain the fallout from the arrest, with President Emmanuel Macron saying France would be \u0027extremely vigilant\u0027 about the stability of Renault and the alliance.Analysts said that despite clear tensions between the two firms headquartered 10,000 kilometres apart, neither company has the financial might alone to make the heavy investments in electric vehicles considered to be the industry\u0027s future.\u0027It would be like a couple orcing after 20 years -- it would be complicated, very expensive and not easy to do,\u0027 said Gaetan Toulemonde, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.\u0027Honestly, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s even possible.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"What did Cabinet REALLY say Mays Brexit deal","story":"The five-hour behind-closed-doors marathon saw a slew of ministers raise serious concerns about the concessions being made to BrusselsHere is what we now know about what each of the Cabinet members said at the historic session:Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVeyThe strength of the Work and Pensions Secretary\u0027s intervention took her colleagues by surprise. One source told MailOnline she was \u0027emotional\u0027. First Mrs May and then the Cabinet Secretary and chief whip Julian Smith cut her off when she repeatedly demanded a formal vote. The exchanges were said to have descended into a shouting match as she was told that Cabinet rules mean votes are never held and the team proceeds by consensus.          The strength of then Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey\u0027s intervention took her colleagues by surprise. She resigned the next morning Health Secretary Matt HancockMr Hancock was among the most supportive speakers on the day.

According to the Telegraph, he quoted Benjamin Franklin on the EU constitution, saying: \u0027I agree with it, with all its faults.\u0027Transport Secretary Chris GraylingMr Grayling is said to have voiced alarm at the impact of the agreement on the confidence and supply deal with the DUP, and suggested there was little chance of it passing through Parliament.Treasury minister Liz TrussMs Truss reportedly urged colleagues to focus on the \u0027end state\u0027 of Brexit rather than becoming obsessed with the details of the backstop.Chancellor Philip HammondMr Hammond is said to have supported the deal saying that the UK had made gains in the negotiations. He said there were better outcomes for the economy, but they would not be supported by Brexit voters. Commons Leader Andrea LeadsomMs Leadsom expressed support for the PM and the work she had put into a deal, but warned there was a \u0027bad narrative\u0027 around the package. She urged Mrs May to seek changes to the wider agreement emphasising that the backstop should only be temporary.Attorney General Geoffrey CoxThe eminent QC and strident Brexiteer played a crucial role in winning approval for the package, but admitted it was an \u0027ugly sister of a deal\u0027. He is said to have compared the agreement to \u0027two oil drums lashed together in a plastic sail\u0027, but urged ministers to \u0027put it to sea\u0027. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt Mr Hunt reportedly told the meeting that Turkey had been negotiating with the EU for 31 years – and Britain risked the same. He said the ‘backstop’ that will keep Britain in a customs union with the EU could become a ‘front stop’, and called for ‘incentives’ to avoid the status of a satellite of the EU.

He has now been removed from his roleHis arrest stunned the car industry and the business world and has plunged an alliance between Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi motors, which he forged, into doubt.Nissan board members voted unanimously to sack  Ghosn as chairman, the Japanese car giant said in a statement on Thursday.The statement said: \u0027After reviewing a detailed report of the internal investigation, the board voted unanimously ... to discharge Carlos Ghosn as Chairman of the Board.\u0027The claims against Ghose come after a month-long internal Nissan probe following a whistleblower report.UN environment chief quits after he is accused of \u0027obscene...Cult leader is jailed for 15 years in South Korea for raping...Share this articleHours after his arrest, his hand-picked successor as CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, launched an impassioned broadside at his former mentor, muttering about a \u0027dark side\u0027 to the Ghosn era and urging his sacking.However, even after being removed as chairman, Ghosn remains  a member of the board as a full shareholders\u0027 meeting is required to remove him.Ghosn is seen as being responsible for the revival of Nissan, as well as the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, which sold a combined 10.6 million cars last year - more than any other firm.The alliance, which employs 450,000 people globally, is now thought to be under threat as Ghosn was believed to be the glue holding it together.  His sacking comes after he was arrested for financial irregularities. Ghosn is being held in spartan conditions at a Tokyo detention centre (pictured)The disgraced boss is being held in custody in a Tokyo detention centre and has not been seen in public nor made any comments since his arrest.He received a visit from Brazilian consul Joao de Mendonca on Thursday who told AFP that Ghosn \u0027sounded very well, in good health\u0027.However, his conditions are likely to be a far cry from what the millionaire businessman is used to. Inmates at the centre are typically allowed 30 minutes exercise per day and only two baths a week.Ties and strings are removed to prevent suicide attempts and former guards and lawyers said Ghosn was almost certain to be held in a cramped cell on his own.On Wednesday, prosecutors successfully applied to extend his custody for an additional 10 days as they step up their questioning.Deputy chief prosecutor Shin Kukimoto said that the type of crime Ghosn is accused of is \u0027one of the most serious types of crime\u0027 under Japan\u0027s Financial Instruments Act and Ghosn could face a 10-million-yen fine andor a 10-year prison sentence.Under the law, companies themselves can be held accountable for the falsified documents,  following reports that prosecutors believe Nissan also has a case to answer.  The crisis appeared to be going from bad to worse for Nissan, as the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that prosecutors believe the firm also had a case to answer. Both Nissan and the authorities declined to commentPublic broadcaster NHK said Nissan had paid \u0027huge sums\u0027 to provide Ghosn with luxury homes in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam \u0027without any legitimate business reason\u0027.Ghosn had a reputation as a hard-nosed workaholic with no qualms about closing factories and slashing jobs -- earning the nickname \u0027Le Cost Killer\u0027 in France, where 47,000 employees work for Renault.But his exorbitant salary and flashy lifestyle - at odds with Japanese corporate culture - has long been criticised.According to the Financial Times, Ghosn\u0027s fall from grace came as he was working on a full-blown merger of Nissan and Renault. Ghosn\u0027s departure could now be used as a pretext to rebalance the alliance in Nissan\u0027s favour, according to reports.Renault has held off on removing Ghosn, saying that Nissan had failed to share the evidence it had gathered with its sister company.Governments in Paris and Tokyo have been scrambling to contain the fallout from the arrest, with President Emmanuel Macron saying France would be \u0027extremely vigilant\u0027 about the stability of Renault and the alliance.Analysts said that despite clear tensions between the two firms headquartered 10,000 kilometres apart, neither company has the financial might alone to make the heavy investments in electric vehicles considered to be the industry\u0027s future.\u0027It would be like a couple orcing after 20 years -- it would be complicated, very expensive and not easy to do,\u0027 said Gaetan Toulemonde, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.\u0027Honestly, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s even possible.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"What did Cabinet REALLY say Mays Brexit deal","story":"The five-hour behind-closed-doors marathon saw a slew of ministers raise serious concerns about the concessions being made to BrusselsHere is what we now know about what each of the Cabinet members said at the historic session:Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVeyThe strength of the Work and Pensions Secretary\u0027s intervention took her colleagues by surprise.

Sometimes they can only operate after sundown. They have had to cover their faces when they go out in public. \u0027They have had to remove the rosary that hangs from their car rear-view mirror for fear of attack.\u0027   What is next: Ms Bibi freed from prison, but the family has said it is  too dangerous for them to stay in Pakistan and they are being hunted door-to-door by hardliners The Pakistani government has struck a deal with a fundamentalist Islamic party, under which the party would call off violent protests at her acquittal while a review of the court\u0027s decision is taking place.The deal has led to accusations of appeasement and capitulation being levelled at  Pakistan\u0027s prime minister, Imran Khan. Tory vice-chairman QUITS over government\u0027s failure to offer...‘We are in your emails and computer, watching and recording...Share this article\u0027There will be a war if they send Asia out of country,\u0027 hardline Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) leader Cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi said after the deal was reached.Pontifex told the Guardian that Bibi\u0027s family were relying on their faith to get them through each day, and that they hope they might have a future one day outside Pakistan.              A Pakistani supporter of the Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), a hardline religious party, holds an image of Christian woman Asia Bibi during a protest rally following the Supreme Court\u0027s decision to acquit herA total of 19 MPs and Peers, including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, have written to Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to allow her to Britain, but the government has refused to answer questions on whether it will consider asylum. Some reports suggest ministers are worried about a possible backlash from British Pakistani Muslims, though the The Muslim Council of Britain has strongly denied this.Labour MP Mary Creagh, one of the signatories to the letter, said: \u0027I think the world has been shocked by the awful treatment of Asia Bibi and her unjust imprisonment.           Ms Bibi\u0027s husband Ashiq Masih, pictured with their daughter Eisham, has asked Donald Trump and Theresa May to grant the family asylum. They are constantly on the move as they are being hunted down by religious hardliners \u0027Several countries have offered her asylum and it is a mark of shame that Britain has failed to do so given our large Pakistani community here and our historic ties.\u0027 John Woodcock, an Independent MP on the home affairs select committee, said: \u0027The UK should be proud to be a sanctuary for those being persecuted because of their religion so it would be appalling if Asia Bibi is genuinely being denied asylum because of fears she could be targeted by Islamist hardliners over here.\u0027 The Muslim Council of Britain wrote on Twitter: \u0027There are unfounded media reports that Pakistani national Asia Bibi is being denied asylum into the UK because of concerns from British Muslims.           The protests only subsided after Khan\u0027s government made a deal with hardline Islamist that they could appeal her release, and that Ms Bibi would have to stay in the country  A supporter of a radical Islamic group stands guard as protesters block a main road to condemn a Supreme Court decision that acquitted Asia Bibi\u0027We find such insinuations to be as nonsensical as they are isive. We see no reason why Asia Bibi should be denied asylum into the UK.\u0027The allegations against Ms Bibi date back to 2009, when she was working in a field near her home village in Sheikhupura, Punjab and was asked to fetch water.The Muslim women she was labouring with objected, saying that as a non-Muslim Ms Bibi was unfit to drink from the same water bowl as them.Ms Bibi would later say that the women insulted her religion, to which she responded: \u0027I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind. What did your Prophet Mohammed ever do to save mankind?\u0027  Asia Bibi, 53, was sentenced to death in 2010, after being accused of insulting Islam during an argument over a water bowl with a group of Muslim women in PunjabThis prompted the Muslim women to go to a local imam and accuse Ms Bibi of blasphemy against the Prophet Mohammed.   Before Ms Bibi could be arrested on any official charges, a violent mob descended on their family home, and beat Ms Bibi up in front of her children.The abuse was so violent, police were called to the scene, but after rescuing the mother-of-five, they arrested her and threw her in jail - and a year later she was convicted of blasphemy.Blasphemy is a charge so sensitive in Pakistan that anyone even accused of insulting Islam risks a violent and bloody death at the hands of vigilantes.The charge is punishable by a maximum penalty of death under legislation that rights groups say is routinely abused by religious extremists as well as ordinary Pakistanis to settle personal scores.The law does not define what blasphemy constitutes, and evidence is often not reproduced in court for fear of committing a fresh offence.Despite this, calls for reform of the blasphemy law have regularly been met with violence and rejected.Asia Bibi family being hunted \u0027house to house\u0027 in Pakistan | World news | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"Mother accidentally texts client saying toilet","story":"Sales adviser Jamie Astwood, 28, (left, in a recent photo at home) was messaging her best friend Jess Turner on Tuesday morning at the same time she was trying to sell her husband\u0027s old handset over Facebook.

It was a halfpenny piece.\u0027I had not seen one of those for a while, so I carried on digging and another few coins come out.  The postman found an old halfpenny coin, another 7p in coins (pictured on the floor) and a front door key.

Your mindless doodles can actually reveal a lot about your personalityIf you’ve ever been unwillingly stuck in a classroom, lecture hall or company meeting with a notepad and pen, there’s a good chance your mind went wandering and you absentmindedly drew some shapes. While these days one might be more likely to scroll through emails or social media, “there’s a lot to be said for putting down your electronic device and grabbing a pen or pencil and just doodling”, says Martin Hastings, consultant graphologist and member of the British Academy of Graphology.“Despite the apparent decline in handwriting, more people seem to be taking up activities such as calligraphy, letter-writing, colouring-in and writing journals,” says Hastings, who believes it’s because we increasingly long for creative downtime. “People enjoy expressing themselves artistically and letting their imagination run free, which is what doodling is all about.”There’s great variation in what people draw, but often doodles represent recurrent thoughts. “Men who like football draw balls and goals, people whose obsession is sex often draw genitals,” says John Beck, former chairman of the British Institute of Graphologists. “Often they express unconscious longings – such as the sun for those who want a warm holiday or arrows of aggression for people harbouring lots of anger.”Another study, presented in 2011, found that posting sketches on social media enabled people to convey complex emotions that they wouldn’t have been able to through words alone. “Neuroscience is uncovering some fascinating things about what parts of the brain are activated by both doodling and writing by hand,” Hastings explains. “One area of interest to researchers is the frontoparietal network, which seems to regulate temperament and emotion – the building blocks of personality. Another is the parietal lobe, which is linked to creativity and visual imagery. These areas ‘light up’ when someone writes by hand or draws.”Hastings describes doodling as “an expressive gesture” that’s good for the soul and that, “like handwriting, stimulates brain synapses and synchronises the left and right hemispheres, something that typing or keyboarding do not”.The benefits of doodling also extend to mental health, particularly in the context of therapy. “Doodling has a calming effect on people. We do it at all sorts of different times, for fun, to release tension or relieve boredom,” says art psychotherapist Cate Smail. “It’s easy to talk and draw at the same time, as it uses different parts of the brain. Focusing on the drawing helps to take away some of the stress or anxieties around what you may be talking about, so it can be very helpful during art therapy. It can enable people to speak more openly about difficult or painful memories.”It can be just as beneficial for our mental health in everyday life, adds chartered psychologist Carie Schuster. “It’s a wonderful way to be mindful and is quite meditative. It focuses the mind, shuts out noise or distress and helps you to be present in the now. The anxious, depressed or traumatised brain loves this kind of activity, so it’s very good for us.”There’s also a lot to be said for putting down your phone or tablet and doodling on a device that mimics the sensation of a paper and pen. “Everyone should be encouraged to use their devices less and write by hand, such as keeping a journal or diary, writing a letter or card to a loved one, or just drawing something for the fun of it,” says Hastings.Some devices, such as reMarkable’s paper-like tablet, enable you to write and draw fluidly and precisely on documents that you can sync to the cloud. Having your old etchings in one easily accessible place is hugely beneficial, as Schuster explains. “Doodles become really valuable to a person and can hold nostalgic importance. When one sees old doodles or comments in books from years ago, it’s enjoyable and brings you back to that moment.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1f473e0fb6869cb4d4f2d96d2d94bf3992e82d/0_169_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03aef1738878f651b44d867ecc5a6bf2","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:First up: ancient history. Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War continues to delight paulburns:First read it at age 17. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve reread it after that. Its one of my favourite books. Just to mention a few magnificent highlights of great historical writing - The sea battle between the Corcyreans and Corinthians, 433 the plague in Athens, 430 the fighting at Megara, 424 the character sketch of the Spartan commander, Brasidias the rise and fall of Cleon the destruction of the Athenian Expedition in Sicily, 413 the oligarchic Coup and its overthrow in Athens.I can’t do a post on Thucydides and not mention his use of speeches. He gives recollections of speeches he has heard himself or pieces together a speech from accounts of those who were there at the time. Apart from the Melian dialogue, where he more or less expounds on his philosophy of history, he begins a tradition in classical historiography which is eventually much abused by speeches just being made up by some later writers. If you haven’t yet read Thucydides, put aside some time to do so. Its a reading experience you won’t forget.Another “non-fiction delight”, Babel (Around the World In 20 Languages) by Gaston Dorren, has occupied storm46:What an enjoyable read for a Languages nerd! The story of 20 Lingua Francas, sometimes their particular linguistic quirks (to other language speakers - not to the native speakers concerned of course), their social conventions, their rise to power and the reasons why they may have become a lingua franca, and just oodles of fascinating facts. The chapters, depending on the language under discussion, cover linguistics, history, politics, and the writing style is effortlessly readable and very funny.I particularly appreciated this quote from the sardonic chapter on Français, written in 1671: “Of all languages, French has the most natural and sleekest pronunciation. The Chinese and well-nigh all Asian peoples sing the Germans grumble the Spaniards holler the Italians sigh the English whistle. Only the French can properly be said to speak.”BerlinBirdie wants to “rave” about The Buddha in the Attic by Julie Otsuka:About Japanese brides travelling to the US in the 1920s to marry Japanese emigrants there, who’d mostly lied about their financial and social status, and sent photos of younger, better-looking men to tempt their brides. Rather like a dating app in fact. The book details the women’s experiences in a precise, moving way, not by following inidual stories but by depicting their varied but collective experiences - written in a first-person plural voice (“We were... Some of us found...”) and taking their lives stage by stage - the voyage, the arrival, the first night, babies, children, etc etc. A lot of their experience was hard as you might expect, yet the tone is never accusing or miserable. It’s clear, calm, delicate - almost poetic in fact. Brilliant.Completely brilliant, every last story. Every last word. There were stories from all across the spectrum, pre-war Colorado, antebellum slavery, Mexico in the days of Pancho Villa, hardscrabble Texas... They all seemed to rotate a common center of gravity, the struggle against unrealized potential for pre-Suffragge women. It still seems relevant in an age when women’s health choices are often dictated to them by the ovary-free.Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris has been the “right book at the right time” for LiteraryWanderings:This was my first foray into the world of David Sedaris and it won’t be my last. I found that the essays became stronger after the first third, but how much this was the writing or me becoming attuned to Sedaris I’m not sure. Laugh out loud funny in parts, this has been a perfect reading companion of late.Finally, EstelleMoon took a “nosee into nostalgia” and read Night Watch by Terry Pratchett:I really liked it! It’s one of the City Watch series within Discworld which focusses on Sam Vimes and the police force of Ankh-Morpork. It made me laugh out loud more than once, and is at the same time a pretty pointed and successful satire on revolutionary idealism.It’s a great book.

Under Japanese law, suspects can be held for 20 days per possible charge without an official indictment. Additional charges can be added, resulting in longer detentions.Shin Kukimoto, a deputy public prosecutor at the Tokyo district public prosecutors office, refused to comment Thursday on whether Ghosn, who has yet to be charged, had admitted to the allegations.Prosecutors believe Ghosn and an American executive Greg Kelly “conspired to understate Ghosn’s income five times between June 2011 to June 2015”, reporting a total of 5bn yen in income ($44m) instead of the actual 10bn yen.The Nissan board also voted to remove Greg Kelly from his position as representative director, the Nikkei business newspaper said.Nissan said on Monday that an internal investigation launched after a tip-off by a whistleblower had also revealed that Ghosn allegedly misused company money.NHK said Nissan had paid “huge sums” to provide Ghosn with luxury homes in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam “without any legitimate business reason”.The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said Nissan’s investigation had uncovered evidence that, starting in 2002, Ghosn instructed that about $100,000 a year be paid to his elder sister as remuneration for a non-existent “advisory role”.The Asahi Shimbun quoted unnamed sources as saying that Ghosn gave Kelly orders by email to make false statements on his remuneration.Ghosn’s arrest has prompted questions about whether the alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, which employs 450,000 people around the world, can survive without Ghosn.This week Renault voted to keep him as its chief executive but appointed Thierry Bolloré, the chief operating officer, as interim chief.According to the Financial Times, Ghosn’s fall from grace came as he was working on a full-blown merger between Nissan and Renault, at the French government’s urging, despite strong reservations among Nissan executives.“For me, the future of the alliance is the bigger deal,” a senior Nissan official told reporters on Wednesday, when asked about Ghosn’s arrest. “It’s obvious that in this age, we need to do things together. To part would be impossible.”Mitsubishi plans to remove Ghosn from his post of chairman at a board meeting next week.Despite Nissan’s decision to sack the pair, Ghosn and Kelly, who is also being detained, will stay on as board members and can be removed only by shareholders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a023e124087171ed3761049faf22a111c7d2172d/0_82_2106_1264/master/2106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9afc166e54fb5aa759f9740139f0077","title":"price cap plan clamp down  high rent to own fees fca","story":"High interest charges levied by firms such as BrightHouse, which sell household appliances and electrical goods on credit, mean items can cost four times the average retail price, when insurance and warranties are included, the Financial Conduct Authority said.The financial regulator noted that only a third of rent-to-own customers are in work, most are on low incomes between £12,000 and £18,000, and are likely to have missed a bill payment in the last six months.In a 2016 league table of all measures of poverty, the UK did rather better compared with other nations. The study, also by Unicef, ranked the UK joint-14th out of 35 rich nations. This was just above the US, but well below many European countries, notably Denmark, Finland and Norway. On some specific measures the UK did less well, notably education, where it\u0026nbspranked 25th\u0026nbspout of 39 countries, and health, where it was 19th out of 35.In the\u0026nbsplatest official comparison\u0026nbspof poverty across the 28 countries in the European Union, the UK ranked 15th. This was some way behind the Czech Republic, Sweden and the Netherlands but ahead of Ireland, Spain and Italy. The European figures confirmed the JRF’s observation that the number of people at risk of poverty in the UK has risen since 2008.Under the proposed price cap, credit charges (including interest and delivery and installation costs) cannot total more than the original cost of the product. In addition, rent-to-own firms will need to benchmark the cost of products against the prices charged by three other retailers.Andrew Bailey, the FCA’s chief executive, said: “Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society.“A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.“We want to stop consumers having to pay many multiples more than the price of a product on the high street. These changes build on the measures we have already taken across the high-cost credit sector.”Citizens Advice hailed the cap as a “victory for people who struggle with the runaway costs of rent-to-own agreements”.Its chief executive, Gillian Guy, said: “These products are aimed at people who have little choice but to resort to this type of credit, yet they come with crippling interest rates on prices that are far higher than anywhere else on the high street.“A cap gets to the heart of the problem by stopping costs from spiralling out of control and pushing people into further debt. Our evidence has repeatedly shown that well-designed caps can reduce the harm high-cost credit can cause, as they have done in the payday loan market.”The cap will come into force on 1 April 2019 following a consultation. The FCA is also introducing a two-day cooling off period for the sale of extended warranties, to stop firms selling them at the point of purchase.

Is a new spaceport the answer?Houston has a long and proud connection with space exploration. It is home to the Johnson Space Center, the Nasa hub best known for hosting Mission Control. But as the US government squeezes Nasa’s budget and cedes much of its work to private industry, high-profile tycoons such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Sir Richard Branson are generating most of the buzz around the future of American spaceflight. And they are elsewhere.In an attempt to stay relevant, Houston is transforming its 101-year-old Ellington airport into a major spaceport. “It keeps the city at the cutting edge of space and maintains it as Space City USA,” said Mario Diaz, director of aviation for the Houston Airport System, which manages Ellington and the city’s two major passenger airports, George Bush Intercontinental and Hobby.“In 2010 there was a decision made by the US government to get out of the financing of low Earth orbit, the missions to put up satellites and things like that. What we’ve been doing over the last eight years is transitioning from a government-led space programme to a commercially driven space programme.”Musk and Bezos have set up shop in other parts of Texas. Musk’s SpaceX is building a launch site by the border with Mexico, while Bezos’s Blue Origin has a launch facility in the remote west of the state. In a sign of the competition between cities and the importance of political lobbying and financial incentives, Houston lost out to Huntsville, Alabama, last year when Blue Origin was deciding where to place a new manufacturing plant.Houston’s spaceport has struggled for lift-off, but last month the city council approved spending almost $19m on infrastructure development such as roads and utilities. That is a fraction of the public money lavished on Spaceport America, the country’s best known commercial spaceport, which has been subsidised by New Mexico taxpayers to the tune of more than $200m. Branson’s Virgin Galactic is based there, near the vast White Sands Missile Range military testing ground. It will charge space tourists $250,000 for a few minutes of weightlessness 62 miles above terra firma. Last month Branson said the company’s long-awaited first voyage beyond Earth’s atmosphere was imminent.It’s hardly the first risky futuristic endeavour in the flat and empty desert of southern New Mexico – where, after all, the first atomic bomb was tested. But it is not a convenient location for visitors. The nearest city to Spaceport America of any note, Las Cruces – population a shade over 100,000 – is more than 50 miles away.By contrast, with about 7 million people, Houston is the fifth biggest metropolitan area in the US, and Ellington is only 17 miles south-east of the city centre. The suburban location makes big, booming, smoke-billowing, vertical heavy rocket launches out of the question. But lower-risk horizontal launches are feasible: an aircraft can be over the Gulf of Mexico in seconds.If Houston’s spaceport thrives, it is likely to resemble a technology campus with a runway attached. It would be an aerospace incubator where companies and academic institutions can develop products and skills a research and development community rather than a host for headline-grabbing launches for big tech companies.As a concept this lacks the drama, daring and wonder associated with space exploration in the popular imagination. But it might be the most viable and valuable way forward for the fledgling American commercial spaceflight industry. And a similar formula may be on the horizon in Colorado. The US’s 11th federal spaceport licence was granted in August to Front Range airport, only a couple of miles from Denver international airport.Currently there’s not much to see out on Ellington’s eastern fringes, just a couple of office-style buildings, grassy fields and Nasa’s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, where astronauts train in a giant pool to prepare for the weightlessness of space. But this is the area officials are hoping to transform into a major spaceport, and next door to Nasa’s lab is the Houston spaceport’s first tenant: a 60-person firm called Intuitive Machines developing drones and metallic additives in an airy former Boeing building.Underlining the opportunity to unite private enterprise with government expertise is the fact that Steve Altemus, the president and CEO of Intuitive Machines, is a former deputy director of the Johnson Space Center. “I think maybe sometimes the term ‘spaceport’ gets in the way of understanding what the full potential of this collection of people in this city can produce,” he said, speaking at a symposium organised by the not-for profit group Aerial Futures.“So a spaceport says: ‘Hey, I’m going to launch vehicles from this place.’ Well, that isn’t going to happen in an urban environment. But what can a spaceport be?“Maybe this is a portal for engineers and scientists and technicians and technologists to come together to invent and create new ideas that advance commercial space, that advance the industrial growth of the city of Houston, that actually push forward the boundaries for airborne systems and airport systems.”But spaceflight is just one area in which work at the spaceport could have an impact. Developments in passenger air travel such as hypersonic flight might also be brought closer to reality through work at facilities such as Ellington.“Some of these technologies and products and services will migrate, once proven, from Ellington airport up to Intercontinental or to Hobby airport,” Diaz said. At stake industry-wide, he added, are “hundreds of billions of dollars … very quickly, as soon as we get the first commercially operational spacecraft, we establish the engines, and then we’ll be able to break the bounds of gravity and really propulse into space – it could be trillions of dollars easily.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b68f2dfeec1712f2f1e965e5741d0ac38c21f1a/0_94_2035_1221/master/2035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6429a765d76b32829395cbc6fa2d7485","title":"cabinet britain ignorance ministers dominic raab","story":"We’ve all experienced that immediate panic after saying something stupid. The hot rush of shame pumps through our bodies and we are gripped by the forlorn hope that we could rewind time. The claustrophobic fear that we are forever diminished in the eyes of those who witnessed our stupidity causes genuine panic. We are convinced that this is a moment from which we will never recover.Reading this may trigger you into remembering some daft thing you once said at a party or in a meeting. Imagine for a second not that you would never do this again but that, when you did, you would feel none of the usual shame and embarrassment. Now you know how it feels to be one of Theresa May’s cabinet ministers. The glut of ignorance we’ve had to suffer recently has highlighted a major problem: we are being led by people who don’t know what they are on about and are unabashed about admitting it in public. If ignorance were an energy source, you could power the country purely on former Brexit secretaries.Dominic Raab’s revelation that he “hadn’t quite understood the full extent” of how “we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing” for trade was incredible, not just because of how infuriatingly ignorant it was but also because he managed to overshadow that disaster of a sentence in the same speech by suggesting that he’d never previously realised that Britain is an island. Wait until he finds out what gravity is. We’re told that Raab is an ambitious man. Apparently that ambition doesn’t extend to looking at maps or reading his then department’s own impact assessments, which have been warning about the effects on the port of Dover for years. If Raab were a toddler, watching his cognitive development would be charming. Having him say it when he was the Brexit secretary, however, was depressing and confirmed our worst fears – the architects of Brexit are no better informed than your average pub bullshitter. It’s politics by tabloid, a detail-free vortex where ignorance isn’t just tolerated but celebrated. Even in the context of the chaos of Brexit, Raab’s admission was a shameless demonstration of arrogance that sends a message to the rest of the world: Britain is a joke.Raab had at least taken attention away from Karen Bradley, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. If you share my concern that the Tories have been ludicrously dismissive about concerns around the Irish border, you probably destroyed furniture when you heard Bradley’s admission that she “didn’t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland – people who are nationalists don’t vote for unionist parties and vice versa … Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities.” Are these people even interested in politics? How could an MP not know that, let alone the secretary of state for Northern Ireland? I’d be amazed if any other MPs didn’t know that. Which means that May chose the only MP who knows nothing about Northern Ireland to represent it in cabinet just at the time when an expert is needed. Which, by the way, is all the time.These aren’t just startling admissions of ignorance, they are revealing more about a class of cabinet-level “talent” who are apparently uncurious about politics, people and the effect that decisions have on them. At this rate I wouldn’t be surprised if the health secretary Matt Hancock popped up and said: “It’s really cool being health secretary, I’ve just discovered these things called hospitals. Have you heard of them? Wow. Just wow. They like, operate on people and stuff. Some of them even have an Upper Crust in reception. I had no idea!” At a time of great jeopardy for our economy and our security, we’ve got into the habit of appointing clowns to serious office. Not just any old clowns, though – clowns who are happy to show off their silly makeup. It would be like Fulham FC – currently facing the prospect of a relegation battle – choosing to appoint its mascot, Billy the Badger, to manage the final few games. In fancy dress.Politics, while still full of decent, talented and well-meaning people, is becoming a pedestal for the ignorant. If politics is the art of the possible, surely it’s possible to have better politicians? I get plenty of material out of this crop, of course. They’re a gift to a topical comedian, but I increasingly find myself laughing about these things through gritted teeth. As a citizen I’m outraged at how the government and opposition are being run. Incompetent politicians make it easier to write routines and jokes, but I’d rather the country was well-run and I had to work a bit harder to find material. And if that’s not sacrifice, I don’t know what is. For now, I’ll keep attacking our rulers through the medium of standup comedy, which I’ve only just discovered involves telling jokes to audiences.• Matt Forde starts his nationwide Brexit Through the Gift Shop standup tour at London’s Southbank Centre on 1 and 5 December and his Political Party Podcast Xmas Specials with special guests at the Leicester Square theatre on the 19 and 20 December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df920bbf14fd40970c42a0511ebcd380b513f434/0_124_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4837a97567e21fa5288207b8cc702f8","title":"john mcdonnell leftwing conservatives tory labour","story":"The good old politics of purity are back just as everything descends into chaos. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, can’t be friends with Tories because of the suffering he sees that Conservative MPs and governments have inflicted. Fair enough: it’s an honourable choice, I suppose, to be so virtuous as not to want to go near the contaminating aura that anyone who voted for Tory policies emanates.Except lots of people who vote Tory just aren’t driven in this way, the big ides are really between those who are politically engaged and those who are not, and currently Brexit is in any case reshaping the two main parties in Britain.I presume when McDonnell wants to negotiate his wonderful people’s Brexit with added jobs on, he will have to talk to Tories and maybe some people in the EU, many of whom are basically ex-bankers. He really doesn’t have to be friends with them. He can take some hand sanitiser along. This is not Snog Marry Avoid?, it’s just day-to-day business.There is a certain luxury, dare I say, privilege, for Tory-avoiders: they signal their own worthiness by not mixing with those who vote differently. They flaunt their socialist heritage, which I find peculiar as I don’t think ideology is genetic. I grew up in a working-class Tory family. Was I, as soon as a I became politically conscious at about 14, to simply stop speaking to my mother? I did try that for a while, it must be said.Was I, in all the various crap jobs I did, not to get along with people because they were not socialist enough? When I went to live in the US, even the mildest proclamation of what would now be called centrist views was regarded as madly communist. But did I make friends? Yes of course I did. Can I find shared values with people who once every few years tick a different box – or who don’t even bother? Obviously. Do all my friends have to think the same things as me? No. I can’t imagine anything more spectacularly boring.On the left anyway, everyone hates everyone else more than they hate the Tories. The biggest insult is “Blairite” for the new generation of unsullied cadres who worship the current Labour leadership. There are clear lines, there are right and wrong things to think. I totally understand this if you are aged 14, but in anyone has had a life or any political nous, it makes me despair.Do I actually need to say here that the likes of Iain Duncan Smith make me nauseous (not theoretically: I have had the experience of listening to him over dinner – and he made me sick)?George Osborne is indeed a gloating architect of misery. I don’t think anyone should ever be their friends. But normal people? The ones who give blood and do a bit of charity work, and believe in small business and “getting on” I know them and I don’t find them all evil. They are wrong, possibly, but not bad people.In fact the working class from which I come remains a huge disappointment to the hard left in its refusal to rise up and speak in one voice and overthrow the system. I am all for that, but how is this to happen? And maybe they need to be persuaded. Is politics not ultimately about getting people on-side? Right now we have this politics of purity clearly going haywire in front of us: Labour thinks it can win an election without getting people who voted Tory on board.Remainers think they can win a second referendum without persuading leave voters to change their minds. They’re depending on the fact that many leave voters may have died since 2016. Hey, way to go progressives! There is a certain buzz to be had from pretending to be in a war of position in which various people are denounced in a tweet. But this is bonkers. Encouraging a campus culture that protects young people from encountering difference scares me, because actual difference – the rise of the far right – is not something that one be can be shielded from. Strategically and politically this is not an option.I don’t really care who people have as friends. It’s human nature to cluster around people like ourselves. There are far too many “vote Labour, live Tory” types to lecture me anyway, in big houses with kids in private schools, and a cocoon of correctness does not appeal. There is more than one moral high horse to mount here. Martin Luther King said: “Love is the only force capable of transforming an enemy into a friend.” Isn’t political transformation the goal?

But while Labour is quite justified in presenting itself as the alternative minority government, this isn’t likely to happen without a general election.The prime minister is appointed as the party leader most likely able to command the confidence of parliament. Changes of prime minister can take place without an election, so on that front Labour is right that the Queen could, theoretically, call on Corbyn without an election.In the UK, a prime minister does not automatically need to have a coalition or confidence and supply agreement in place. They do, in the end, need to be able to pass certain money and supply bills in order to fulfil the two most important functions of government: collecting taxes and paying for services. And they need to be able to survive no-confidence votes that will otherwise trigger a new general election.Minority governments can get legislation through on a case-by-case basis, which is one reason why the current Conservative government can remain even if their confidence and supply agreement with the DUP breaks down. But it is also a reason why Labour can argue that it should be in government now, even if it is well short of a majority through any parliamentary deal. And even if Theresa May were forced out by her party, it is not a given that Corbyn would take over. It is true that if the Queen needed an alternative there are many precedents for looking to the opposition (it happened in 1923-24 when a hung parliament split the vote between Liberals, Labour and Conservatives).But political realities still favour a Conservative successor. Should May fall, her advice as outgoing prime minister would be for a Conservative to take over. The Queen would not want in any way to be seen to be taking sides.The Conservatives still have a higher seat share than Labour. And their much-battered confidence and supply agreement with the DUP still stands.The Fixed-term Parliaments Act means May can reasonably survive most parliamentary challenges short of a motion of no confidence  or leadership challenge. If she was brought down by a leadership vote, she would probably remain as prime minister until her successor took over. If it was a vote of no confidence in parliament, then we would have a general election anyway.The less stable the Conservatives look, the more Labour’s argument that it is ready and waiting will gain traction. But the mechanics make it highly improbable without a general election.• Catherine Haddon is senior fellow at the Institute for Government"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9fda8355a48b6c7a5f73100fb081fc6a5f62b5a1/0_304_5066_3041/master/5066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a0dacf3d423a2ec45433303b4909a7","title":"respect eu britain outside left economy","story":"The left needs to work on its own plan to rebuild our economy, and that will be easier after BrexitTheresa May’s mantra should fool no one. While the prime minister insists repeatedly that her Brexit blueprint will mean the UK controlling its borders, laws and money, the real aim of the government is to keep as close as possible to the status quo.Whitehall, with the Treasury to the fore, was highly pessimistic about Britain’s economic prospects outside the EU and hasn’t changed its mind about the desirability of finessing the softest of all Brexits. Philip Hammond has been able to whistle up plenty of support from employers’ organisations which – unsurprisingly, perhaps – want as little disruption to business as usual as possible.This pessimism is curious for two reasons. It suggests that the low-wage, low-skill, low-investment economy that existed on the day Britain voted in the June 2016 referendum is as good as it gets. What’s more, the pessimism about the UK is mirrored by an optimism about the health of the EU that is unwavering, despite a plethora of evidence to the contrary.The unwarranted gloom about the UK and the exaggerated respect for the EU are not new. Many of those who now say that Britain must stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible predicted disaster when the pound left the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 prophesied a decade later that Britain would rue the day that Gordon Brown gave the single currency a wide berth and said with the utmost confidence in 2016 that a vote for Brexit would lead to an immediate and deep recession and a massive increase in unemployment. None of these things happened.On the other hand, the predictions made by those who thought the single currency was one of the daftest ideas of all time have come true. The euro, it was said, would lead to economic ergence not convergence between member states, be run along monetarist lines, entrench high levels of unemployment and leave Europe in the growth slow lane. The rise of populism across Europe, which is being documented by the  this week, has everything to do with the failure of Europe’s flagship project.As the single currency struggled, its devotees took comfort in the prediction from Jean Monnet, one of the pioneers of the original common market, that Europe would be forged in crisis. The design flaws glaringly exposed by the bailouts required for Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Cyprus, together with the run on Italian and Spanish bonds would give the drive for integration fresh vigour. But as Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, noted recently, none of the things that would be required to make the euro work have happened. The banking union has not been completed, the capital markets union has not been completed, and there is not the remotest prospect of a common eurozone budget overseen by its own finance minister because Germany fears that would result in its taxpayers footing the bill for public spending in other countries (as it would). Europe is still, as Monnet said, being forged in crisis, but the forces of disintegration are currently much more powerful than the forces of integration.A prolonged period of slow growth has highlighted another weakness: Europe’s lack of economic dynamism. There are strong, world-beating European companies but almost all of them were created many decades ago. There is no European Facebook or Google, no rival – as there is in China – to eBay. When it comes to artificial intelligence, Europe is lagging well behind the US and China. Europe’s position as the world’s biggest market is a legacy of its success in developing the products that were behind the economic boom in the first three decades after the second world war – cars and other consumer durables. In terms of the fourth industrial revolution, Europe is playing catch-up.It is this slow-growing and politically riven Europe, not the confident rapidly expanding Europe that gave West Germany its Wirtschaftswunder and France its Trente Glorieuses from 1945-75 that Britain is planning to leave.And while there would certainly be a short-term hit to the economy from a no-deal Brexit, this would be mitigated by policy easing. Interest rates would be cut by the Bank of England, while the Treasury would sound the death knell for austerity by announcing tax cuts and spending increases. Even at its gloomiest, the Treasury cannot come up with forecasts that suggest the impact of Brexit will be anything like as serious as the financial crisis of a decade ago.There are those who say the answer is not for Britain to leave but to reform Europe from within, so that it is run along progressive rather than neoliberal lines. But Germany is never going to agree to a common budget and the European Commission wants to fine Italy because the government in Rome is seeking to stimulate growth by running a higher deficit than is allowed under the eurozone’s hardline budget rules, so that might take a while.In the meantime, there is an opportunity to do things differently, to exploit the policy space that Brexit affords and tackle the structural problems that have plagued the economy for decades. The right has its plan: more liberalisation. It is time for the left to come up with its own vision that would deploy every available policy tool to modernise the economy, rebuild Britain’s industrial space and spread prosperity more widely.Such a transformation is much more likely to happen outside the EU than inside. That’s because the two most significant UK imports from the rest of Europe – German industrial goods and cheap labour – have helped to bend the economy out of shape by holding back the manufacturing sector and encouraging the growth of low-wage service sector jobs. It is possible to do better than that.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cd821826e57ef47bf987fa913d4746561b5ef62/0_117_5250_3150/master/5250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a000c6f1a4d6441f648ed0107def554b","title":"thank heavens tact delicacy call centre staff","story":"The pay and the stakes may be low, but don’t underestimate the skills needed to deal with angry customers such as meI used a Zipcar for the first time yesterday and it broke down.

Are students and academics increasingly turning against them?At a recent green innovation event at Imperial College, London, PhD candidate Naomi Pratt and several other students handed out flyers. They were holding elephants on sticks, or “oilophants”, to represent the elephant in the room at the discussion: Imperial’s links with the fossil fuel industry. “Within two minutes we had security guards coming round saying ‘you can’t hand out flyers here, you can’t have this sign. Move along, you’ve made your point,’” Pratt says.Pratt is the leader of Divest Imperial, a group set up to pressure the university to eliminate financial investments in fossil fuel companies from its endowment fund, and reduce its reliance on research funding from the fossil fuel industry. Although their protests are not always shut down, the recent event wasn’t her only experience of being asked to stop flyering in a public part of campus. “It’s a stark example of how Imperial is run as a business, and how it’s trying to control its image,” she says.In addition to questioning Imperial’s relationships with the industry, Pratt is troubled by their access to students and the campus. Fossil fuel companies make regular appearances at careers fairs, and some courses have mandatory field trips sponsored by the oil and gas sector. “They have an almost ubiquitous presence on campus,” she says. “You hear students repeating industry lines back to you: ‘we’re going to need fossil fuels for x amount of years, it’s important to have an energy mix.’”Can universities justify these relationships? Imperial says it works with industrial partners to find “solutions to the world’s need for energy”, alongside research aimed at reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels – through carbon capture and storage, for example, or battery technology and solar cells. It defends its investments as enabling its endowment to better invest in research and education.Chris Saltmarsh, a co-director at People \u0026amp Planet, says that although fossil fuel estment has been the most successful student environmental campaign, there is growing concern about universities’ wider links with the fossil fuel industry. “Students are saying these companies need to be challenged – do they deserve any space on our campuses at all?” he says. “We don’t think it’s right for universities to be profiting from or investing in companies driving the climate crisis.”Part of the reason the movement hasn’t gained the same traction as estment, in Saltmarsh’s view, is that fossil fuel relationships can be hard to map, and are in some cases “deliberately opaque”. “It would take a policy shift on a governmental or supra-governmental level to outlaw fossil fuel companies from research partnerships,” he says. “We would argue that all public research institutions and any other companies investing in research for the public good shouldn’t be associating themselves with fossil fuel. Any relationship is either profiting them directly or bulking up their reputation so that they can continue to extract.”The picture is similar in the US, where Ben Franta, a PhD student at Stanford University, is working on a study mapping how much research is funded by the oil and gas industry. He believes there has been an “invisible colonisation of academia” by fossil fuel companies. “I think that most people are still largely unaware of the pervasiveness of oil industry funding in academia, especially for climate and energy research,” he says. “The full picture of the ubiquity of this funding is not really known yet.”Like Pratt, Franta cut his teeth in the estment movement. It was only when he observed that professors who were vocal against estment often received funding from the oil and gas industry that he realised how insidious these relationships can be. He sees it as only a matter of time before campaigns start to target research funding and the visibility of oil and gas companies on campus.“One of the amazing things about this whole story is that all this has happened without anyone really knowing about it,” Franta says. “When most people hear about this situation they’re pretty shocked by it. They think: ‘this doesn’t make sense – it’s like tobacco funding health research, there’s a clear conflict of interest here.’”Among academics, attitudes are conflicted. James Dyke, a visiting environmental sciences academic at Southampton University, is a staunch advocate of the need for radical action to slow down climate change. Yet he acknowledges the defences of fossil fuel relationships that some colleagues offer. These companies are aware of the significance of climate change, but the global economy would collapse if they stopped producing overnight. Equally, they plug serious gaps in research funding, without which some departments would be forced to close.“Universities should ideally be places to work with those companies to allow them to transform,” Dyke says. “Walking away and taking the moral high ground – ‘we won’t take your money’ - means cutting off what could be a critical player in the required transition.”The problem is that fossil fuel companies aren’t working towards the transition to a lower carbon economy in any meaningful way. According to Mat Hope, editor of environmental investigative journalism website DeSmog, much of the money from the oil and gas industry goes towards funding research that will help companies continue to operate in the North Sea region for many more years – by drilling in deeper and more treacherous waters, for example. “This is despite climate scientists explicitly stating that the industry will have to be rapidly shut down,” he says.Hope sees the support for universities from fossil fuel companies as part of a deliberate strategy to soften their image. “They are trying to become an integral part of the economics of higher education as a means to encourage a favourable tax environment, and ensure ongoing local and national government support for the industry,” he says. “All despite the UK’s climate commitments.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8052faad80042b591193529a82defdd9dd2dc5c/47_58_3996_2397/master/3996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be75dd1f8456f1fad8c8b3aaa35eaea","title":"sir david attenborough to speak for the people at un climate summit","story":"Filmmaker takes new ‘people’s seat’ and will form speech with input from social mediaSir David Attenborough is to address the UN’s climate change summit in Poland in December, taking up a newly established “people’s seat” at the negotiations.The people’s seat initiative, which launched on Wednesday, will give citizens around the world the opportunity to send their messages to leaders via social media, using the hashtag #TakeYourSeat. These views and information from opinion polling will then form the basis of Attenborough’s speech to leaders.“We all know climate change is a global problem – and for that it requires a global solution,” said Attenborough. “This is an opportunity for people from across the globe, regardless of their nationality or circumstances, to be part of the most important discussion of this century the unprecedented action needed to reach the Paris agreement targets.”“I encourage everyone to take their seats and to add their voice so that the ‘people’s address’ truly represents a mix of voices from across the world,” he said.The world’s governments are meeting in Poland to negotiate how to implement the Paris agreement on climate change, secured in 2015. They will also discuss how to increase global action to meet its goals to curb global warming.The summit follows a warning in October from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that urgent and dramatic action across the whole of the economy and society is needed to cut emissions and prevent dangerous climate change.The people’s address will also trigger the launch of the Facebook Messenger “ActNow” bot on the United Nations’ central Facebook account. This is intended to make it easier for people to understand the actions they can take personally in the fight against climate change by making recommendations, such as taking public transport and eating less meat. The number of actions will be tracked to highlight the impact collective action could make.“The challenge to humanity that climate change represents is of such epic proportions that only through collective global action will we have a chance to combat it successfully,” said Michael Moller, director-general of the United Nations Office at Geneva, who first suggested the new initiatives.“Every single human being on our severely stressed planet has to take responsibility,” he said. “If we don’t, we all fail with catastrophic consequences. The people’s seat initiative provides the impulse for seriously ramping up global solidarity, especially among the young who, at the end of the day, are the ones who will have to deal with the mess we have left them with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47644f98c35aa7cf210cc3d22d4756ce53899d18/243_268_3447_2068/master/3447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64b112e029c6624789ba8d4d55aeb97c","title":"climate heating greenhouse gases at record levels says un","story":"Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are far above pre-industrial levelsThe main greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change have all reached record levels, the UN’s meteorology experts have reported.Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are now far above pre-industrial levels, with no sign of a reversal of the upward trend, a World Meteorological Organization report says.“The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5m years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,” said the WMO secretary general, Petteri Taalas.“The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed.”Levels of CO2 rose to a global average of 405.5 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2017 – two-and-a-half times higher than before the industrial revolution.The WMO also highlighted the discovery of illicit production of CFC-11, a banned chemical that also both warms the planet and destroys ozone. Investigations indicate that at least some of the production is in China.In October the world’s scientists said global warming of even 1.5C would have severe consequences for humanity. International climate agreements had for two decades set 2C as a limit.“Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,” said the WMO deputy secretary general, Elena Manaenkova. “CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere.”Prof Corinne Le Quéré, of the University of East Anglia, said she was not surprised by the new record levels of greenhouse gases. “But I am very concerned that all three gases most responsible for climate change are rising upwards unabated. It seems the urgency and extent of the actions needed to address climate change have not sunk in.“Low-carbon technologies like wind, solar, and electric transport need to become mainstream, with old-fashioned polluting fossils pushed out rapidly.”Efforts to cut emissions are increasing and on Wednesday the UN’s climate change body published a report on the commitments made in 2018. It found 9,000 cities in 128 countries were taking action, along with 240 states and regions in 40 countries and more than 6,000 businesses in 120 countries.Patricia Espinosa, head of the UN framework convention on climate change, said: “On one hand, greenhouse gas emissions have yet to peak and countries struggle to maintain the concentrated attention and effort needed for a successful response to climate change. On the other hand, climate action is occurring, it is increasing and there is a will to do more. I highlight this because falling into despair and hopelessness is a danger equal to complacency, none of which we can afford.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f12c22361776f685e8224632e01992395fb2de2/49_524_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=532af567334a8c8e85360b5adadb63f6","title":"good to earth the lavazza 2019 calendar in pictures","story":"Photographer Ami Vitale’s images of six nature art installations around the world aim to spread good news about efforts to protect the environment"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f39bdafa240dd86f93afc291e65805081390756/984_257_4738_2843/master/4738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f858aee930749510126db51f50c3ddb0","title":"gervinho parma serie a china arsenal interview","story":"Gervinho picked up the ball just outside his own penalty area and started to run upfield. The Parma winger had six Cagliari defenders against him and only one teammate. By the time he had got to the halfway line he had escaped two wild sliding challenges while keeping the ball under control. One burst then took him past the last remaining midfielder and a final injection of speed left the central defender beaten. Finally, after a 70-yard run not dissimilar to George Weah’s goal for Milan in 1996, he dispatched a right-foot shot that went in off the inside of the post.The Parma midfielder Luca Rigoni was so stunned he started applauding rather than celebrating. The whole Parma bench surrounded Gervinho to congratulate him. The Ivorian was back at the very highest level, scoring in Serie A again, two and a half years after he left for the Chinese Super League.It was a remarkable turnaround for a player most people thought had taken the money for an easy life at Hebei China Fortune. He had departed Roma aged 28 but here he was, back in Italy, scoring a contender for goal of the season at 31.When we meet at Parma’s training ground Gervinho is relaxed. He loves being in Italy, enjoying the food – “You have an Italian dish and you smile for the rest of the day” – and, most important, is enjoying his football. “Everyone thought I went to China to retire and get paid,” he says. “They thought I was on vacation for a few years. I had some injury problems and that’s why people started to say Gervinho was done. But they were very wrong. Every week we had to give our best in China there are many great foreign players now and this also motivates the Chinese players.“I never let myself go. In China you have to be in peak form because you need to do well. You earn a lot – I had a huge salary – but then you have to prove you are worth it. Every match is a challenge and I played next to or faced some truly great players.”So why did he return to Italy? “It all started with a phone call from Parma’s sporting director, Daniele Faggiano. We talked and after a few minutes we already had a proposal. He was very quick, pragmatic, enthusiastic – he deserves most of the credit. I felt in love with this project immediately.”Gervinho swiftly proved his powers have not waned. He has four goals in eight Serie A games, including one against Juventus. Parma, promoted from Serie B, sit comfortably in 11th after 12 games.“It couldn’t be going better,” he says. “When I told people I was going to Parma, a lot of them didn’t think it was a team good enough for Serie A … but instead we are doing great. Avoiding relegation is still our goal but then we will see about realising some significant dreams.”Parma are Gervinho’s ninth club in a career that has included scoring for Ivory Coast at the World Cup and winning the Africa Cup of Nations. Yet there has always been the feeling among fans he could perhaps have done more. So does he have any regrets?“Not even one,” he replies emphatically. “You must never forget where you came from. I was born in a tiny place in Ivory Coast, so being a protagonist in this life is a dream. I started playing football in Abidjan, my African town, without even having shoes on my feet.“I was lucky to go on to have a good life, thanks to my passion. I played in the club of my dreams, Arsenal. I won a league title and a French Cup, I brought the Africa Cup to the people of my country and felt like a hero. I had great champions as teammates and I think I have many years in my career ahead of me. I have no regrets, I just want to enjoy every moment, every action, every shot on goal, because all of a sudden one day it will all end and without football life is sad.“When I grew up I had to play without boots. In Ivory Coast it’s very hard to have normal shoes, so just imagine football boots – they were considered a true luxury. In the academy where I grew up there were only players with no shoes like me and when I went back a few years ago I played with no shoes next to them.“But in that academy it became a philosophy. They tell the kids: ‘You play with no shoes on, so you learn how to better control the ball. When you have shoes it will be much easier and you’ll become champions.’ And after many years, after reaching some milestones, you finally get those boots. Joy after suffering, always with a smile. Unforgettable.”After starting at Asec Mimosas Abidjan and representing Toumodi, Gervinho moved to the Belgian club Beveren in 2004. After moving to France to play for Le Mans, he joined Lille in 2009 and won the title – the club’s first in 56 years – before a transfer to Arsenal in 2011.“Arsenal are the team that have left the biggest mark on me, without a doubt. I lived a dream. Any kid who starts playing can’t help but to dream to play at a club like Arsenal. The day I signed I cried. I remember it like it was today: it was in 2011, I told all my family and was jumping for joy. It was a source of great pride to sign with a club like that. I didn’t lose my smile from the first to the last match at Arsenal. I remember when I left I wanted to thank everyone, even the dressing-room staff.”Gervinho has played with greats, including Eden Hazard at Lille and Mohamed Salah and Francesco Totti at Roma. “I knew Eden would become a global star. He had feet, mind, body and class: everything you need to become a champion. Salah is a tough guy. Always calm and strong, with the mentality of a hard worker. I’ll never forget his training sessions: very high rhythm, pushed like a madman, you watched him in amazement. He had a sort of positive effect – you saw Salah and wanted to work harder. Talent and sacrifice.”Everywhere Gervinho has learned things, starting in France. “I was a kid when I arrived – it taught me about being a professional. England is an extraordinary place, the Premier League is like a dream. I learned how to live as a person and footballer thanks to those years. In Italy there’s a lot of quality work on tactics, in training, really impressive. In China you need to be strong too: you can’t feel like you are on vacation, you need to teach something to the next generations. But Africa is always in my heart, Africa stays within you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79d6f45af5990a7b4de29e983ddee7c62dcbd929/31_38_2496_1498/master/2496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d1832408c0780d9450f40e69248b18","title":"how are premier league loan players faring part two leicester to wolves","story":"From Loris Karius to Patrick Roberts we check how the players are doing to see if they have a future at their parent clubsIslam Slimani, 30, Fenerbahce The striker has made 13 appearances for Fenerbahce in both the Turkish league and the Europa League this season. He has scored six goals for the club, including two in a Europa League match against Spartak Trnava.George Thomas, 21, Scunthorpe Though born in Leicester the midfielder has been progressing through the Wales youth ranks. He has been getting the game time he wanted at Scunthorpe, where he has made 13 appearances and scored a goal in a league match against Oxford.Harvey Barnes, 20, West Bromwich Albion A much sought-after prospect, Burnley-born Barnes has been a regular in the Baggies midfield since joining this season, and has scored six times in 19 appearances.Filip Benkovic, 21, Celtic The Croatian centre-half has made nine appearances for Celtic in the Scottish Premier and the Europa League. His loan is season long, though he could gain an early recall to Leicester should Harry Maguire leave the club in the January transfer window. Paul WilsonLoris Karius, 25, Besiktas The goalkeeper moved to Turkey on a two-year deal following the Champions League final and, a couple of further errors aside, has done well. So much so, in fact, that Besiktas’s president, Fikret Orman, has express an interest in signing the German on a permanent basis.Adam Bogdan, 31, Hibernian Established as the Scottish club’s No 1 following his arrival there in July, the Hungarian is enjoying life in Edinburgh so much that he wants to make the move permanent when his contract at Liverpool expires in the summer. “The people at the club are fantastic,” he said.Sheyi Ojo, 21, Reims The winger is doing reasonably well during what is his fourth successive loan spell. He has made a number of appearances for the Ligue 1 side, including a 90-minute display against Paris Saint-Germain, and scored in the Coupe de la Ligue.Harry Wilson, 21, Derby County The Wales winger has established himself as an important part of Frank Lampard’s exciting young side and earned national attention with a stunning free-kick during Derby’s Carabao Cup victory away at Manchester United in September.Marko Grujic, 22, Hertha Berlin Ankle ligament damage has disrupted the Serbian’s time in Germany but it has otherwise gone well, and having recently signed a contract extension with Liverpool until 2023, the midfielder expects to return to Anfield after his one-year loan deal expires.Ryan Kent, 22, Rangers One of two Liverpool players on loan at Rangers, the winger has bedded in successfully at the Scottish side. Indeed, he has often been Steven Gerrard’s best player and so it came as a blow to player and manager when Kent was recently sidelined with a hamstring injury.Connor Randall, 23, Rochdale Now on his third loan spell, and one that runs until January, the full-back has barely made an impact at Spotland, partly because of a fractured cheekbone he suffered in a Checkatrade Trophy match against Bury in September.Allan, 21, Eintracht Frankfurt The Brazilian is on his fifth successive loan spell having joined Liverpool from Internacional in 2015, a partly enforced move as he remains ineligible for a UK work permit. The midfielder has yet to make an impact in Germany.Danny Ings, 26, Southampton The striker has been a notable success on the south coast, quickly establishing himself as a crucial source of goals for a side that struggles to score on a regular basis. As was the case at Anfield, injuries have disrupted Ings’s progress.Ovie Ejaria, 20, Rangers As is the case with Kent, Ejaria has caught the eye since moving from Anfield to Ibrox. The midfielder has featured regularly, domestically as well as in Europe, and impressed with his energy, dynamism and poise.Ben Woodburn, 19, Sheffield United Liverpool’s youngest-ever goalscorer has struggled at Bramall Lane, so much so he was sent back to his parent club in order to get some game time. Part of the problem for Woodburn is that United are performing well, hence making it difficult for him to get a look in.Taiwo Awoniyi, 21, Gent There are high hopes for the powerfully-built Nigerian forward at Anfield and he signed a long-term deal with the club in July. He moved to Gent in order to build on his successful loan spell at fellow Belgian side Royal Excel Mouscron last season and has continued to impress. Herbie Kane, 19, Doncaster Rovers The young midfielder started the first league game on the bench but has been virtually ever-present since, with Doncaster sitting eighth in the League One table. Sachin NakraniPablo Mari, 25, Deportivo La Coruña The Spanish centre-back is a regular in the club’s defence, starting nine of their 14 Segunda División matches, after captaining Holland’s NAC Breda last year.Erik Palmer-Brown, 21, NAC Breda The American defender is gradually establishing himself, making four starts in 12 Ereisie games, including the last two, while being in all but one matchday squad.Luke Brattan, 28, Melbourne City Australian midfielder has recovered from being hospitalised with a neck injury during a game against former club Brisbane Roar in August to be a regular for one of City’s sister sides.Douglas Luiz, 20, Girona To Pep Guardiola’s disappointment the Brazilian was refused a work permit so returned to Spain, starting seven consecutive games before suffering a muscle injury.Mix Diskerud, 28, Ulsan Hyundai At a seventh club, the peripatetic USA midfielder who failed to convince at one of City’s sister outfits, New York City, is doing so in South Korea, starting 12 of the 13 games he has so far been available for.Anthony Cáceres, 26, Melbourne City Australian is underlining his near-zero chance of ever playing for City by starting only one of four A-League matches.Luka Ilic, 19, NAC Breda Impressed in a 2-1 win over fourth place Heracles a fortnight ago, scoring the opener for relegation-threatened Breda. Has started half of the Ereisie games.Daniel Arzani, 19, Celtic Made a sole appearance before being ruled out for the season due to a torn ACL ligament. He tweeted: “This is a tough time for me.”Marlos Moreno, 22, Flamengo The striker ended a two-year goal drought three weeks ago, scoring in a 1-1 draw with Palmeiras. “I would have been happy for the drought to continue if it meant that we’d won,” he said.Patrick Roberts, 21, Girona The forward recently inferred an intention to stay the whole season despite starting only two La Liga matches – which had caused suggestions he was unsettled.Jack Harrison, 21, Leeds United Fourteen appearances and a goal so far though the attacking midfielder has struggled to serially contribute from a recent wide role.Tosin Adarabioyo, 21, West Bromwich Albion Enjoyed an integral part in a fine 4-1 win over Leeds United last time out and has featured in 10 of 17 league games so far, playing the full 90 minutes in the past four.Lukas Nmecha, 19, Preston North End A centre-forward yet to register in 11 Championship starts finally did so for England Under-20s in Monday’s win over Germany.Manu García, 20, Toulouse Operating mainly in his preferred attacking midfield berth the Spaniard has managed two assists in 12 Ligue 1 starts.Thierry Ambrose, 21, Lens Four goals and two assists in Ligue 2 illustrates how the forward is flying in France.Paolo Fernandes, 20, Breda Is struggling to establish himself, managing only three starts and one assist and has been left out of the last six matchday 18s.Matt Smith, 18, FC Twente His impact is such that Twente asked Wales manager, Ryan Giggs, to ensure his game time would be managed when called up for recent internationals to ensure availability for Saturday’s match with Go Ahead Eagles.Ed Francis, 19, Almere City The centre-back has made several matchday squads but is yet to feature in the first-team, though he has played eight reserve games.Thomas Agyepong, 22, Hibernian Scored a first goal against Dundee but then missed a penalty that ensured a Scottish League Cup shootout loss to Aberdeen. Winger’s form also earned a Ghana recall.Brandon Barker, 22, Preston North End The winger is enjoying a run in the team, scoring twice in the EFL Cup and is considered a success so far. Jamie JacksonDean Henderson, 21, Sheffield United The goalkeeper is in sparkling form for the Championship side, keeping five clean sheets, and is the Blades’ No 1.Matty Willock, 22, St Mirren Has featured 12 times and shown versatility by performing across midfield.Demetri Mitchell, 21, Hearts Another player showing an ability to move between roles, operating in defence and midfield, Mitchell is displaying a growing maturity.Kieran O’Hara, 22, Macclesfield Town Was on the wrong end of a “character building” 8-0 EFL Cup reverse to West Ham United but regular football is aiding his development.Joel Pereira, 22, Vitória Setubal Two clean sheets in eight appearances though made a howler against Feirense in a recent 2-1 win.Axel Tuanzebe, 21, Aston Villa One of United’s brightest prospects is gaining invaluable game time as a first-choice Championship defender.Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, 21, Scunthorpe United Has suffered concussion and a hip injury but also scored twice in a 5-3 win over Charlton Athletic, one of 17 appearances.Timothy Fosu-Mensah, 20, Fulham Dislocated a shoulder in September and is experiencing life at the bottom of the Premier League due to Fulham’s struggles.James Wilson, 22, Aberdeen Won a goal-of-the-month award for a strike against Hamilton Academical but is still not a regular. “We’re showing patience,” said manager Derek McInnes. JJJack Colback, 29, Nottingham Forest The midfielder fell out with Rafa Benítez but is now thriving under Aitor Karanka at Nottingham Forest. Playing regularly and a cornerstone of Karanka’s promotion push.Henri Saivet, 28, Bursaspor Barely played for Newcastle and the Senegalese midfielder is now in Turkey where he has made seven appearances this season.Dwight Gayle, 28, West Bromwich Albion The striker swapped for Salomón Rondón in a double loan deal is thriving at the Hawthorns and has now scored nine goals in 12 Championship games.Rolando Aarons, 22, Slovan Liberec Great things were once expected from the left winger but he seems to have lost his way and after playing poorly – and being withdrawn – in his first three games for Slovan Liberec he is now out of the first team. Expected to return to Newcastle in JanuaryDan Barlaser, 21, Accrington Stanley The Gateshead-born midfielder is hoping for a Turkey call up – the country of his father’s birth – after impressing on loan in League One. Showing off his full passing range and starting regularly.Luke Charman, 20, Accrington Stanley The striker is yet to start a league game for the League One side but has been involved in three cup ties.Josef Carney, 21, Morecambe The centre-half is doing well and playing regularly in League Two. Louise TaylorGuido Carrillo, 27, Leganés Arguably the worst piece of business in Premier League history, Saints’ £19m club-record signing was shipped out on loan this summer after failing to find the net in 10 appearances. Reunited with Mauricio Pellegrino, he has scored against both Madrid clubs in La Liga this season.Harrison Reed, 23, Blackburn Rovers Another Championship stint beckoned after failing to break into the first-team group this summer. Has shone for Tony Mowbray’s side after playing regularly at Norwich City last season.Jordy Clasie, 27, Feyenoord Signed by Ronald Koeman on a five-year contract in 2015, the Dutchman continues to impress abroad. Helped Club Brugge to the Belgian title in 2018 and has made 11 Ereisie appearances this season.Josh Sims, 21, Reading The forward shone on his Premier League debut against Everton, but slowly fell out of the first-team picture after injury. Has struggled to cement a starting berth in the Championship.Ryan Seager, 22, Telstar Prolific at youth level, the striker’s long-term future looks set to be away from Saints after making his Premier League debut in 2015. Has scored two goals this season.Sam McQueen, 23, Middlesbrough The talented wing-back was heavily involved during pre-season at Saints before linking up with Tony Pulis’s side. Made six appearances before rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament against Crystal Palace.Sofiane Boufal, 25, Celta Vigo Once the club’s £16m record signing, a move away became inevitable after falling out with Mark Hughes last season. Has scored two goals in 10 games and has been in and out of the Morocco squad. Ben FisherCameron Carter-Vickers, 20, Swansea Now a regular in the USA squad, the centre-half wanted to push himself at another Championship club, having played regularly on loan at Sheffield United and Ipswich last season. It has not worked out so far at Swansea, where he has played only four matches, two of them as a starter.Josh Onomah, 21, Sheffield Wednesday The midfielder has chipped in with a couple of assists but he has been in and out of the starting XI and, with Wednesday an unsettled place under Jos Luhukay, he has struggled to make a big impression.Marcus Edwards, 19, Excelsior The attacking midfielder wanted regular senior football for the first time in his career and he has got it, starting in seven of nine Ereisie matches. The 19-year-old has impressed with the ball at his feet and is learning from week to week.Connor Ogilvie, 22, Gillingham The left-back has returned to League One Gillingham, where he made 42 appearances in all competitions last season, but he has played only six times so far this time out.Sam Shashoua, 19, Atlético Baleares The attacking midfielder picked an unusual port of call for the first loan of his career – on the island of Majorca in Spain’s Segunda Divisíon B, which is the third tier of competition in the country. Shashoua has started regularly and scored three goals for a team that is riding high. David HytnerDaniel Bachmann, 24, Kilmarnock Having largely been used as back-up to Jamie MacDonald, but for Killie’s last league game at Hearts their positions were reversed, with Bachmann keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 win.Kingsley Fobi, 20, UD Ibiza The former Ghana Under-20 captain, a right-back, has only started one game for Ibiza this season, and even then was taken off after 53 minutes. He has seven further substitute appearances, but has not played in any of their last five league games.Tommie Hoban, 24, Aberdeen The injuries that have severely disrupted the career of the now 24-year-old defender have continued to plague him in Scotland, with knee and shoulder problems restricting him to a single league start, and he is unlikely to play again before January.Alex Jakubiak, 22, Bristol Rovers After seeing plenty of action at Falkirk in the second half of last season at Bristol the striker has been used almost entirely as a substitute, and is yet to score or assist a goal.Obbi Oularé, 22, Standard Liège The Belgian fancied himself as the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic when he arrived at Watford in 2015, but has yet to make much of an impact. He returned from a seven-month injury absence at the end of October and has scored freely since, if only for Liège’s under-21 side.Dodi Lukebakio, 21, Fortuna Düsseldorf The 21-year-old Belgian winger arrived from Anderlecht in January and spent only 15 minutes on the pitch for Watford, but after initially being used only as a substitute he has started the last three Bundesliga games for struggling Fortuna.Dimitri Foulquier, 25, Getafe The right-back was signed in the summer of 2017 but spent last season at Strasbourg and this with Getafe, where he has been pushed into midfield and scored twice in five league games.Jerome Sinclair, 22, Sunderland His hard work and physicality have impressed but Sinclair is not a reliable goalscorer. He has, however, started six of Sunderland’s last seven league games, scoring once.Luis Suárez, 20, Gimnàstic A Colombian striker with a familiar name, Suárez is a regular starter with Gimnàstic in the Spanish second tier, though he has so far proved less prolific than he was at the next level down the Spanish pyramid with Real Valladolid B last season.Randell Williams, 21, Wycombe Wanderers Returned to Wycombe in the summer after spending the second half of last season there. He has played across the front three and despite scoring only one goal so far has started 13 of their 16 league games.Cucho Hernández, 19, Huesca Hernández has only scored one league goal this season – after 121 seconds of Huesca’s game at Camp Nou, which ended in an 8-2 defeat – but made an even quicker impact on his full international debut for Colombia, scoring 32 seconds after coming on and again in stoppage time during a 3-1 win over Costa Rica last month. He is considered one of the brightest young strikers in Europe. SBEdimilson Fernandes, 22, Fiorentina Despite his versatility the Switzerland international was unable to win over Manuel Pellegrini before joining Fiorentina on loan. Has made 11 appearances for the Serie A side and could make the move permanent next summer.Jordan Hugill, 26, Middlesbrough A last-minute signing from Preston North End in January, the striker appears to have no future at West Ham. Hugill dropped back into the Championship on loan in August and has scored two league goals in 11 games for Tony Pulis.Sam Byram, 25, Nottingham Forest The right-back’s rash tackling often cost him in the Premier League and he sought a fresh start at Nottingham Forest, only for knee surgery to curtail his progress.Josh Cullen, 22, Charlton Athletic A neat and tidy midfielder who could have a good career in the lower isions, Cullen has impressed at the Valley. Lee Bowyer wants to sign him on a permanent basis.Toni Martínez, 21, CF Rayo Majadahonda A move to the second ision in Spain suggests the striker will be sold soon. Has played nine times and scored once in the league so far.Marcus Browne, 20, Oxford United The young forward scored to help Oxford into the third round of the Carabao Cup and has caught the eye in spite of some injury problems.Martin Samuelsen, 21, VVV-Venlo The Norwegian winger has helped VVV Venlo rise to sixth in the Ereisie, but he still needs to work on his physique and end product.Sead Haksabanovic, 19, Málaga The Montenegrin youngster has only played once for Málaga in the Spanish second ision.

That’s the real test, they said. That’s what’s holding Tottenham back from taking that extra step and winning trophies, they said. So Tottenham started winning away games against big six sides. After one win in 19 away games against the elite, they beat Chelsea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge in April and Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford in August.The problem is that since then they have started losing against the big six at home: twice to City and once to Liverpool and, for good measure, to United at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals as well on what was theoretically neutral ground. It’s as though they cannot be good both at home and away at the same time, the most frustrating weather-house in the world.Approaching Saturday’s home game against Chelsea, that statistic becomes very relevant. Win, and Spurs will go above Chelsea into third and all will seem well. Lose, and the sense of a gulf between them and the top three – although it would only be four points – would seem vast, the season in effect reduced to a battle for fourth and the final Champions League qualifying slot.It’s hard, frankly, to see a systemic reason for the reversal. Half a dozen games is a small sample size and with the exception of the Cup semi-final, each was won by the side in the better form. And even in that defeat by United at Wembley, Spurs were the better side and had the lead before some deep magic kicked in and both sides reverted to historical type, United coming from behind and Spurs succumbing to Spursiness.But that, perhaps, is the wider point. Spurs were thoroughly outplayed by Liverpool and City this season, and that has cast the rest of their season in a gloomier light than their league position may suggest is deserved. But as Mauricio Pochettino has acknowledged, that position, this best Premier League start in terms of points won, is illusory. It’s to Tottenham’s credit they are finding ways to win but they are not playing well.This is the world of modern football, in which nothing quite means what it would have meant even five years ago. United’s problems slightly dilute the issue, but even with their worst start to a season in almost 30 years, the big six, a third of the way through the season, have lost only three games to the other 14 teams. Take United out of the equation and the only defeat suffered by one of the top five to a non-big-six team was Tottenham’s at Watford (and even then, they led before being undone by their familiar failing of wastefulness at one end and sloppiness at the other).It might not be quite as bad as other leagues in Europe (and, yes, Bayern have had a poor start in Germany and La Liga is unusually chaotic at the moment, but it would still be a major shock if any of the superclubs from those leagues missed out on Champions League qualification) but the Premier League has effectively become like a pub quiz that is too easy, so that everything comes down to a couple of slightly testing questions.Knowing the capital of Denmark or who was the British prime minister at the end of the second world war does not cut it, and neither do wins against Crystal Palace or Cardiff. Consistency against mid-table teams and below is taken as standard any slip has major consequences.Saturday’s game is one of the questions that will make a difference. And for Tottenham, as ever, games like these come bound in existential anxiety. What if they do lose a third home game against a top side? What if that gap does open up? What if this extraordinary squad, assembled so cheaply, remunerated so comparatively poorly, begin to lose faith that glory lies just over the horizon? What if Pochettino, frustrated by delays to the stadium and the lack of funds for signings, is tempted by offers from elsewhere?At the moment it feels the entire Tottenham project is predicated on nobody looking down, on pedalling desperately towards a distant prize. Their struggles in the Champions League must have sparked doubts. A third home defeat in three months to a big-six side would kindle them.The suspicion has lurked for a while that this Tottenham side’s prime role will ultimately be to be sold off to fund a squad who will mount a title challenge in a few seasons’ time. If that coincides with City’s transition after the eventual departure of Pep Guardiola, so much the better.Perhaps this Spurs could survive one difficult season. The stadium problems are an obvious drain, financially and emotionally, and a useful excuse. Perhaps everything really will be fine when they move into the new White Hart Lane. But Tottenham, no matter how ostensibly impressive their results this season, could do with a win and a performance on Saturday to soothe troubled souls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7041599e4673e99590edbf3c3f0ef86208ecfd/0_68_2599_1559/master/2599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da0dab9fe946ac2a2bb982c52ce5018","title":"germany 2018 world cup holders nations league relegation","story":"Germany began the year among the favourites to win the World Cup. They end it in the second tier of the Nations League By Jason Humphreys for Englische WocheThere was a sense of inevitability when Virgil van Dijk volleyed home a last-minute equaliser on Monday night. The Netherlands, a team slowly emerging from their own existential crisis, had already beaten Germany 3-0 earlier in the autumn and they were on hand once again on a chilly night in Gelsenkirchen to make sure their bitter rival’s annus horribilis came to an appropriately humble ending.It could have been quite different. Five minutes earlier Germany were gliding towards victory. A victory that would not have saved them from Nations League relegation, but one that would have been a flicker of light at the end of the dark, damp tunnel of 2018 – particularly thanks to the identity of the goalscorers Timo Werner and Leroy Sané, two torch bearers of the Die Mannschaft rebrand.But as the clocked ticked down and the crowd began shuffling in their cold, plastic blue seats, Van Dijk had other ideas. As the Liverpool defender’s shot flew past Manuel Neuer, arms were flung and heads dropped, but had they really expected anything else? The crowd hadn’t. Deflated and disillusioned, they had been flat throughout. The supporters, the players and Jogi Löw will be glad to see the back of 2018. It has been a mess, on and off the pitch.Germany never got going in 2018. A couple of prestige friendlies in March, in which they drew 1-1 with Spain and lost 1-0 to Brazil, were followed by two warm-up games immediately before the World Cup. Austria and Saudi Arabia looked like ideal opponents: not strong enough to push Germany too hard but not weak enough to make the matches meaningless. The idea was to give the world champions a couple of morale-boosting victories that would get them humming before they defended their title.It did not work out that way for Germany. The supporting cast fluffed their lines in a 2-1 defeat to Austria and then Löw’s first XI huffed and puffed to a narrow win against Saudi Arabia in Leverkusen – a game in which Ilkay Gundogan was booed by the home crowd after he and Mesut Özil had met with Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan. It was not quite the sendoff the squad expected. Still, this was Germany, the world champions who boasted a team that oozed with talent, experience and pedigree. A tournament team. For his part, Löw batted away any negativity, saying his side would be ready when it mattered.So on to Russia. Even after their 1-0 defeat to Mexico in their opening game, nobody could have really expected it to end as badly and quickly as it did. It is one thing to be caught flatfooted as you ease your way into the tournament, but this was different. Germany were wasteful, sluggish and rattled throughout. Something was off.Take two. Sweden. That’s more like it. Toni Kroos not only secured a vital three points, but also provided a potential springboard into the tournament – a chance for the team to get out of the group, dust themselves down and regroup.But with everything riding on the game against South Korea, Germany capitulated. And how. They were out, bottom of a group they were expected to win easily. As levels of schadenfreude around the world reached dizzying new heights, Germany was not amused.Löw’s tactics and selections were dissected and the depth of dissatisfaction sloshing around the squad began to splash over the sides. Rumblings of discontent in the squad had caused cracks and they had become chasms when Meszut Özil’s tweet dropped in July.Perception plays a huge part in football. Experienced veterans suddenly become past it, slow and inflexible. Mercurial and enigmatic forwards are flaky and inconsistent. Neuer, a forward-thinking keeper so often praised and revered for his sweeper-keeper qualities and calculated risk-taking, had become a loose cannon not to be trusted.With the sensationalism and exaggerated soul-searching that follows any tournament exit, it was hard to foresee anything other than Löw clearing his desk. He had made mistakes, no question. He had disregarded the success of the Confederations Cup winners of 2017 and turned back to his trusted old guard, regardless of fitness and form. If the Confederations Cup had been an audition, surely many had earned their recalls. Sandro Wagner, for one, was unimpressed at not being on the plane to Russia and announced his retirement from international football with immediate effect.But it was another absentee from Löw’s squad that raised more eyebrows. Being voted the best young player in the Premier League need not justify automatic selection – and the general consensus was that Sané was a different player in a City shirt – but his omission looked increasingly baffling with every failed attack in Russia.Somehow Löw came out the other side of the inquest with his job. In doing so, he had to admit his own failings and offer a way out of the mess he had helped create. The DFB and the public demanded not just improvements, but a complete rethink. Players would no longer be picked on reputation and fresh ideas were required.To be fair, Löw has obliged. Not only has he given more gametime to players such as Timo Werner, Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka, Thilo Kehrer, Kai Havertz and, of course, Sané. The manager has also made strides to adjust his tactics to suit them. The results remain poor but the performances have – at least in part – improved.A large section of Germany fans are still unhappy, but Löw’s new direction has gone some way to placating the critics and buying him time. He is setting out on the same road Southgate did a couple of years back and is trying to make a demographic shift the catalyst for enthusiasm, vigour and success in the national team. Southgate’s triumphs on the pitch and off it will give Löw and the DFB hope.So what next for Löw and Germany? Some big players have left the international scene and others are likely to be phased out in time. We can expect to see Löw popping up at Bundesliga stadiums up and down the country, casting his eye on some of the league’s younger players. He and his staff now have a break in which they can explore new routes to success. The Bundesliga is full of talented young players who are given time to shine – an advantage Löw has over Southgate.After the Netherlands game, Löw said that, as much as he suffered after the disappointments in Russia, he had found the aftermath of the success in Brazil far harder to process. It makes sense. How do you follow a World Cup win? The sensible thing to do would be to ride off into the sunset a hero and legend. Carry on and you’re probably on a hiding to nothing. The same goes for the players as well as the manager. No matter how poorly 2018 has been for Löw, you have to give him credit for not taking the easy option. Not in 2014 and not now.The one positive Löw can take from 2018 is that he is still has the opportunity to turn it around. He has the players and the backing of the DFB. But perhaps more importantly, he once again should have the bit between his teeth and Euro 2020 firmly in his sights. The questions is: will he make it out of the tunnel to see light shining again?• This article is from Englische Woche• Follow Englische Woche on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9dcd941723fa043f44a9da4db7deb32c8041e8b/0_0_6000_3976/master/6000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=daf53f7319776740d9a24129a7d98e71 1400w","title":"victorias secret show angels lingerie","story":"The brand’s annual show is a worldwide TV event, but former Angels are starting to reveal the uncomfortable truth about the lingerie giant A woman stands on stage and cries. In the auditorium, another woman’s partner gives a standing ovation, his hand on his heart. One mother gushes that she is “so proud” of her daughter. Another goes further: “So much admiration for all your hard work and dedication to being the best version of yourself and making your dreams come true.”We are told that these women are “athletes”, that they are in “peak condition”, that they are “aggressively fit”. But this is not the Olympics or the Paralympics. There are no medals to be won. This is a lingerie show.Launched in 1995, the Victoria’s Secret runway show has been broadcast on US network television every December since 2001, an extraordinary feat for a high-street underwear brand. Almost from the beginning, it has been under fire. In 2002, the US’s National Organization of Women (NOW) protested at the event, calling it a “softcore porn infomercial”. One fashion editor told me that the year she covered the show was the “worst job I’d ever done. All the models look the same. The underwear is so skimpy, you can literally see everything. One of them bent over in a thong and I saw it all.”That is why it is so pernicious. Earlier this month, Ed Razek, chief marketing officer of Victoria’s Secret’s parent company, L Brands, was forced to apologise after telling Vogue that he didn’t want transgender models in the show because it would spoil the “fantasy”. In the same interview, he said there was no interest in portraying a wider range of sizes and shapes.“I’m always asking myself: if we do that, what is the reason we did it?” he said. “Did we include them because it was the right thing to do or because it was the politically correct thing to do? Do they take the place of somebody who worked for a year for the opportunity and cried when they found that they got it?”“Hard work” is a term you hear a lot around Victoria’s Secret models, or “Angels”, as those who have signed an exclusive deal with the brand are called. It means exercise: training, toning, boxing, skipping, using the hashtag “#trainlikeanangel” and working out in invite-only classes with names such as the Skinny Bitch Collective.It is no wonder that many of the models exercise obsessively. The show’s strict weight and body fat requirements, endlessly speculated on in the media, would be far beyond the reach of most adult women. Indeed, they are far beyond the reach of most models, which is why the 50 or so who are picked for the VS “family” each year must endure months of dieting and exercise.Model Robyn Lawley has appeared in Sports Illustrated and on the covers of Vogue Italia and Australia, as well as modelling Ralph Lauren, H\u0026ampM and Chantelle lingerie. She went to a Victoria’s Secret casting six years ago – but was not hired. “It’s a running joke that they see curvier girls every year and never cast them,” she says. “This whole starvation-camp situation before you have to walk that catwalk is ridiculous. Some of them are my friends on that stage I’m not pulling them apart. But they have to put their bodies to such extremes once they cast the show, they couldn’t maintain that kind of lifestyle or they’d die.”Yet this lifestyle is pored over by the world’s media. The Independent, Grazia, Vogue, Elle and the Daily Mail, among others, have all published guidance to looking like a Victoria’s Secret model. Occasionally, they get journalists to try it themselves, and they end up exhausted and hungry, unable to eat out with friends or concentrate. One diet, suggested by trainer Stephen Pasterino, is so restrictive that, by the end, even cauliflower and broccoli are out. Model Barbara Palvin’s boyfriend bought her a bag of cheeseburgers to eat after this year’s show, as if to prove how little she had eaten beforehand. Adriana Lima, the brand’s longest-serving model, told the  in 2011 that she cuts out all solid food nine days before an appearance. Many models do not drink fluids, either. “Dehydration is a massive problem,” one fashion editor told me. Yet every year, this event – this circus of competitive anorexia – is broadcast, streamed, applauded.Publishing details of these regimes, with no warning from medical professionals about their long-term effects, allows a culture to flourish where women are rewarded for their ability to restrict, to deny themselves, to go without. It legitimises a worldview where foods are ided into good and bad, where spinach is clean and cake is dirty, where any moment not spent exercising is a moment wasted, and where being thin is a marker of togetherness and control and success.Lima is retiring from the brand this year, after 20 years. In June, a video on her Instagram account showed her struggling through a workout. “Seeing this video makes me emotional,” she wrote. “Sometimes people look at you from the outside and think: her job is so easy (remember I am not complaining), when they don’t know what you go through. Here I am, four weeks after giving birth to my beautiful daughter Valentina and after days of physical therapy because I had a fractured knee, putting all my focus to get ready for a fashion show (60lb heavier, lol). I learned something during that time. Once you love something, absolutely nothing in this world will have the power to stop you, not even your mind or body!”It is hard to imagine how a brand that claims to have the best interests of its models at heart could allow a woman who has been integral to its identity to ignore all physical and psychological warning signs in her struggle to lose enough weight to be worthy of one more show.The message is this: you are not good enough as you are. If you want to be an Angel, you must diet and train like one – and if you do not, you are out.“It’s pitting girls against girls, which I think is a revolting technique,” says Lawley. “Razek is trying to make it out as though he’s got nothing to do with it, which is complete bullshit. It wouldn’t happen like that normally those girls don’t have to starve themselves like that when they’re not working for that runway.“They all have body dysmorphia. That’s the thing: all these girls, they all have beautiful bodies, none of them need to do any of it. That’s the irony of the whole thing.”“We would never dictate any sort of diet regimen for our models,” says a Victoria’s Secret spokesperson. “We promote a healthy lifestyle.”Earlier this year, Bridget Malcolm, who modelled in the 2015 and 2016 shows, apologised for publicising her “damaging eating habits” and exercise regime. It was an enormously brave thing to do. “Body dysmorphia is a terrifying thing,” she wrote. “I have had countless conversations with fellow models, all of whom are tiny, where they call themselves fat. It is such a hard thing to understand if you are removed from this … but when it becomes a mental game like this, it grows wings of its own.”In 2016, another former Angel, Erin Heatherton, said she had been pressured to lose weight by the company. Despite exercising twice a day, and following a strict meal plan, she was unable to meet the targets set for her. “I got to a point where one night I got home from a workout and I remember staring at my food and thinking maybe I should just not eat,” she said. “I realised I couldn’t go out into the world – parading my body and myself in front of all these women who look up to me – and tell them that this is easy and simple and everyone can do this.”And that is where the brand unravels. Cutting out food groups, foregoing seeing friends to exercise, being unable to eat socially, obsessing about diet, size and shape: anyone who has suffered from an eating disorder will be familiar with all of the above. I spent a full year in hospital at the age of 32 trying to overcome an eating disorder that had gripped me since childhood. It is a long battle, fought every day, sometimes every second, but I know that continuing on that path does not open a door on to happiness or love or safety it is one of torture, punishment, toxic voices, broken relationships and denial. To package these behaviours as a “fantasy” shows nothing but contempt for these women.Through it all, the models are expected to be grateful for the opportunity. The casting for the Victoria’s Secret shows is a humiliating ritual, one in which models must essentially beg for the job. The video for Gigi Hadid’s casting shows one of the most successful models virtually prostrating herself. The brand then publishes this as a marketing tool. “I used to think about what this moment would feel like, and it’s indescribable,” model Maia Cotton says in a quote on the brand’s Instagram.“This has been my dream since I was a little girl,” says Willow Hand. “I’ve never worked so hard or wanted something in my life so badly.”“It’s almost like they’ve turned the Victoria’s Secret show into the American Dream,” says Jerrold Blackwell, who handles new faces and scouting at Next Model Management in Los Angeles. “Once you’ve gotten to this point as a model, this is the pinnacle. You’ve made it. It’s your identity, worth and status.”The company has not always rewarded the models with the same loyalty. In 2012, the show’s creative director, Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou, was asked by the New York Times whether she would cast “plus-size” model Kate Upton, who had already appeared in the brand’s catalogues. Upton would “never” get cast, said Neophitou-Apostolou. “She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and that kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.”Michelle Cordeiro Grant is a former senior merchant director at Victoria’s Secret. She left in 2012 because she “started to take issue with the fact that I was working on these marketing campaigns, and I wasn’t feeling good about myself. It hit home when I got married and I had children. I said to my husband: ‘This isn’t a message I want to share with my daughter.’” In 2016, she started her own lingerie company, Lively, which uses a wide range of models and stories from real women in its marketing campaigns. It has been a huge success.“Victoria’s Secret has never changed,” says Cordeiro Grant, “but the world around them has. I was walking through the subway station the other day in Manhattan and I looked at the ad for the Angels’ ‘fantasy’ runway show and I said to myself: ‘That could be today, or 30 years ago.’”Over the summer, I was coming out of Oxford Street tube station in London when something stopped me in my tracks. Women’s bodies. All different colours and ethnicities, all shapes. They had thighs and breasts and stomachs, and flesh. Soft, everyday flesh. The posters were enormous, twice the size of me. It was a celebration of women’s bodies like I had never seen in mainstream advertising. The woman behind this was Rihanna, the pop star-cum-lingerie designer, whose Savage x Fenty range has radicalised the industry. Her show at New York Fashion Week was a parade of ersity. It could not have been further removed from the sheen and pomp of Victoria’s Secret’s. The message was one of iniduality and emancipation: “Women should be wearing lingerie for their damn selves,” she has said.To be fair to Victoria’s Secret, its claim that the shows have been “culturally erse for a long time” is accurate. The show has featured models of colour since its inception, and Blackwell says the company has been asking for more of them in recent years – “particularly Asian girls, girls you don’t often see on the runway”. One model he has worked with, Aiden Curtiss, has walked for Victoria’s Secret and “does it in a really healthy and happy way”, he says. “She loves being a black woman who is able to represent on that runway.” However, it has also been accused of cultural appropriation, in particular for using Native American headdresses on the runway.All the same, the brand is falling out of sync with the young women whose spending power it relies on. Its beloved plunge bras have been mocked for not even fitting the models who wear them. Rivals such as Savage x Fenty and American Eagles’ Aerie brand (which prides itself on avoiding airbrushing and using erse models) are gaining more market share as women and girls look for comfort, positive reinforcement and bras that are actually comfortable. Third Love even took out a full-page advert in the New York Times this week to denounce Razek’s comments, describing itself as the “antithesis” to Victoria’s Secret.Some models are starting to distance themselves from the show. “Feeling so much better about not doing BS … sorry, I mean VS, now that Rihanna isn’t doing it also,” Jourdan Dunn tweeted (and then deleted) after the pop star pulled out of performing in 2016.Most fashion insiders will tell you that the Victoria’s Secret show is outdated, a relic, a product of a bygone era. But they will add that it still matters. “Doing that show could fast-track your whole career,” one model told me. Blackwell describes it as “absolutely life-changing” in terms of the opportunities it opens and the financial rewards.Personally, I would like to see the show go the same way as plastic straws and carrier bags: shunned and boycotted. I would like to see those pop stars who preach body positivity refusing to play until the brand catches up with the times. Then I would like to see the lingerie industry reborn, using its power and influence to encourage ersity and a world where food is nourishment and exercise is for wellbeing, not punishment. A place where women can give themselves a break for once and enjoy being good enough, exactly as they are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3557e125ba3e772f7c63aa4adb245ac97945302b/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01b2790b34fb571bbe1a2b3abf6a2d06","title":"quiz what kind of a sharer are you","story":"From crisps to feelings, sharing feels good.

What impact is this having on our lives, and what can be done to prevent it? We want to hear your thoughtsIs the internet really destroying our high streets?Increasingly, the convenience and cheapness of online retailers like Amazon is cannibalising independent firms and high street retailers. Many buyers skip the trip into town, or go there to assess the product and then buy it cheaper from the comfort of their sofa. As global capitalism continues its seemingly unstoppable growth, many wonder if we have reached “peak stuff”, thanks to years of high consumption. The switch to online shopping, combined with a slowdown in spending and rising costs from business rates and wages, has battered the profit margins of many retailers. There is also a major shift underway in how consumers spend their leisure time, too – more often choosing to spend their spare cash on holidays and experiences rather than in shopping malls, and increasingly opting to entertain, dine and drink at home. Meanwhile, businesses such as beauty salons, barbers and health clubs are on the ascent, since their services cannot be replicated online, and for many countries there has been a massive surge in vaping shops, coffee houses, and ice cream parlours.The growth in e-commerce is often cited as the main reason well-known retailers are struggling. But is taxing online firms the whole solution? After it was raised in the UK’s budget, the British high street momentarily looked set for rehabilitation. But 2018 has seen more closures across the country. Pubs, fashion outlets and estate agents are prominent among 24,205 closures recorded in the first six months of this year in the UK alone, and the number of shops, pubs and restaurants lying empty has soared by more than 4,400. And that’s just in Britain.Every year, the crisis faced by huge numbers of shops and businesses costs tens of thousands of jobs across Europe and the US. Major chains have collapsed into administration this year while many others have been forced to seek legal agreements with their landlords to shut stores and slash their rent bills. Beyond retail, many towns are having to fight to save their local library, pub, nursery or community centre – the places that have always fulfilled a social function as well as a commercial one.Yet, amid all this, it is easy to forget that, globally, the vast majority of sales – at least four-fifths – are still made in stores, as e-commerce giants have noted. The two worlds are still in the process of converging, so what might this mean for our communities, and is there hope yet of a resurgence?We want to examine the effects of these retail shift on the lives of people across the world, and how it is impacting economies, democracies, and families. How are local businesses coping or adapting? And workers with specialist skills? How is the ‘warehouse culture’ affecting rates of job satisfaction and the welfare of iniduals? And importantly, what action can we take to help slow or even reverse the onward march of e-commerce giants, or at least make them only a part of the picture. We at the  have covered how York’s Bishy road has cultivated the creation of what urban planners call ‘a sticky street’, where ‘time spent’ and enjoyment factor are the key aims of retailers, and we’ve explored how the ‘experience economy’ of a high street without actual shops could work. Our reporters have gone to areas like Bristol and Liverpool where local currencies have been trialled as a means of keeping profits in the neighbourhood. And we continue to examine whether taxing online retailers is the most effective thing that can be done to ease the situation.The debate is ongoing, and we want to hear from you, wherever you are in the world, for this month’s podcast.

It was a similar photoshoot to one in 2003 by the country trio Dixie Chicks. Morgan criticised Little Mix for the similarity, writing on Twitter that they “stole this idea”, and that Jesy Nelson of the group “looks ridiculous … she should put some clothes on”.Ariana Grande’s mother, Joan, first responded to the Good Morning Britain host’s comments, saying: “Did you ever hear of paying homage … if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it.” She also said his criticism of Ellen DeGeneres, for featuring a video of half-naked male celebrities, was “disgraceful”.Morgan replied: “Ellen’s a hypocrite – and as for Little Mix, I’d just prefer they use their talent to sell records rather than their nudity.

Sixty years and 250m sales into his career, there’s been no Rick Rubin v Johnny Cash-style back-to-basics reinvention, no reappraisal in the heritage rock mags, no suggestion of a young artist claiming him an influence. He was one of a handful of British rock’n’rollers whose early releases were raw enough to bear comparison with the records coming out of the US, but his work is still seen as strictly the province of blue-rinsed  readers. Mid-70s soft rock gets belatedly welcomed into the canon, but no one mentions Richard’s 1976 album I’m Nearly Famous, home to the flatly brilliant Devil Woman and Miss You Nights, the latter pillow-soft and emotionally racked. The odd adventurous DJ might play something from an arcane corner of his catalogue (the revered DJ Harvey has been known to drop his 1980 hit Carrie), but Richard’s name as an artist remains beyond the pale.He hasn’t helped himself. He was a rock’n’roll star from an age when rock’n’roll was held to be a passing fad and you were advised to get into panto and cabaret sharpish if you still wanted a career when the novelty wore off. He sang as though he didn’t believe a word of it. (“They say it’s gonna die but please, let’s face it,” snapped his debut single, Move It. “They just don’t know what’s gonna replace it.”) His music quickly softened, and an overwhelming suggestion of the family entertainer has beset him ever since. Already pretty square by the time the 60s started swinging, he probably sealed his fate by joining Mary Whitehouse in the Nationwide Festival of Light, campaigning against “moral pollution” and the permissive society of the counterculture. Still, it seems a bit unfair: you’d struggle to describe the quality of his oeuvre as anything other than variable, but the best bits deserve better than their current reputation.So it would be lovely to report that his first album of new material in 14 years is built to win over the doubters and spark a reconsideration. Alas, it isn’t. There are certainly good things here, not least the title track, which obliquely references Richard’s travails with the South Yorkshire constabulary and the BBC. Tellingly, it’s the work of old hands Graham Lyle and Terry Britten – the latter the co-author of both Devil Woman and Carrie – rather than the Scandinavian writers-for-hire employed elsewhere on the album. But the highlights are marooned amid a bet-hedging hotch-potch of styles and ideas.There are a couple of songs in the vein of his 1982 “gospel in disguise” album Now You See Me, Now You Don’t. Reborn is pretty good, while Wide Deep and High is rather a ripe old cheese. There are runny MOR ballads, aimed directly at Richard’s core fanbase, and there are four old tracks reworked to hop on board the current vogue for whacking the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra over the top of vintage hits, whether it suits them or not. None of them are improved by the addition of sawing strings, although there’s something mind-boggling about the fact that The Minute You’re Gone reached No 1 in 1965. As if to demonstrate how far from pop’s frontline Richard had slipped by the mid-60s, it sounds as if it’s something from the pre-rock’n’roll era. And there is – adopt the brace position – yet another Christmas song, The Miracle of Love. The best thing you can say about it is that it’s more Mistletoe and Wine than Millennium Prayer.The rest chugs along pleasantly enough without ever threatening to set the world on fire. His voice sounds good – there are audible signs of ageing, but falsetto remains within reach. Arrangements tend towards post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul, heavy on the brass. Like the electronic effects on the vocals and the presence of writers used to working with Demi Lovato and Sam Smith, this is clearly intended as a bid for relevance, although if contemporaneity was what Richard was after, he could have sounded hipper still by examining his own back catalogue. Precisely the kind of taut, glossy, synth-y new wave pop sound that powered his superb run of singles in the late 70s and early 80s has become a modern musical touchstone virtually no pop album is currently complete without a whiz-kid production team knocking together something that sounds almost exactly like his 1980 hit Dreamin’.Richard is clearly desperate for a hit, something he hasn’t had in a decade there’s an air of by-any-means-necessary about the Christmas song and the orchestrated oldies. Perhaps if he were less concerned with proving wrong the radio stations who proclaimed him too old, he might make a more consistent album. As it is, Rise Up is not unlike Richard’s back catalogue in general: something to pick through rather than embrace unreservedly.Amor – Glimpses Across ThunderFrom the forthcoming album by the Glasgow disco-not-disco quartet behind last year’s superb single Paradise comes a yearning song over a deliciously understated, vaguely acid-ish groove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/283c48370ffdf409c0e1dab9cca98806064e8b18/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e4d2c0c1cee878150d5d583c2618333 2020w","title":"why is steve bannon in europe today in focus podcast","story":"Donald Trump’s former strategist has been touring the continent and attempting to sign parties up to his pan-European populist project.

But certainly no propellers or turbines or anything like that. So I started looking into what physics might make flight with no moving parts possible, and came across a concept known as the ionic wind, with was first investigated in the 1920s.“This didn’t make much progress in that time. It was looked at again in the 1950s, and researchers concluded that it couldn’t work for aeroplanes. But I started looking into this and went through a period of about five years, working with a series of graduate students to improve fundamental understanding of how you could produce ionic winds efficiently, and how that could be optimised.”In the prototype plane, wires at the leading edge of the wing have 600 watts of electrical power pumped through them at 40,000 volts. This is enough to induce “electron cascades”, ultimately charging air molecules near the wire. Those charged molecules then flow along the electrical field towards a second wire at the back of the wing, bumping into neutral air molecules on the way, and imparting energy to them. Those neutral air molecules then stream out of the back of the plane, providing thrust.The end result is a propulsion system that is entirely electrically powered, almost silent, and with a thrust-to-power ratio comparable to that achieved by conventional systems such as jet engines.Prof Guy Gratton, an aerospace engineer and visiting professor at Cranfield University, said: “It’s clearly very early days: but the team at MIT have done something we never previously knew was possible in using accelerated ionised gas to propel an aircraft. Aeronautical engineers around the world are already trying hard to find ways to use electric propulsion, and this technology will offer something else that in the future may allow manned and unmanned aircraft to be more efficient, and non-polluting. In particular, the fact that they have already got this out of the laboratory, and flown a battery driven model aircraft – albeit so far on a very small and controlled scale – is very exciting.”The successful flight of the plane – which has no name beyond the uninspiring “Version Two” – owes as much to the engineering prowess required to make it as thin and light as possible as it does to the propulsion method itself. The plane weighs just 2.45kg, but manages to fit in a five-metre wing, battery stack, and a high-voltage power converter.In the immediate future, the MIT team hope to increase the range and speed of the plane, primarily by scaling up the size of the overall machine. Potential applications in the short term include unmanned drones, where silent flight may be beneficial, and high-altitude solar-powered flight, where the lack of moving parts could allow such a plane to soar for years on end, acting as a pseudo-satellite.In the longer term, the ability to power flight purely through electricity opens up the possibility of carbon-neutral flight, which could lower the emissions of the aviation industry globally.Barrett also noted that solid state propulsion tends to miniaturise well, and suggested that smaller drones than those currently possible with rotor-based flight could take-off using an ionic wind drive in the future. “Solid state things lend themselves to scaling down quite well,” he said, “creating extremely small flight vehicles that serve uses we can’t imagine.”• This article was amended on 22 November 2018.

It usually develops over the age of 40 in white Europeans, or after the age of 25 in people who are African-Caribbean, black African, or south Asian.The startling new figures come from Diabetes UK, which has combined the numbers of children seen by hospital specialists with those for the young people up to age 25 who are looked after by their GP. Only 715 are receiving care from hospital units, but there are more than 6,000 in primary care, bringing the total to 6,836.Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), which made the hospital figures public earlier this year, said the new data confirmed the real total was higher than feared.“When the RCPCH’s paediatric diabetes audit launched in the summer, we were concerned then that the numbers of children we were seeing with type 2 diabetes was an underestimate. This latest analysis, which takes primary care contacts into consideration, shows these concerns were justified and emphasises the need to act,” he said.The first children diagnosed in the UK were girls aged between nine and 16 in the year 2000. But with a quarter of children overweight or obese when they start primary school, rising to a third by the time they leave at age 11, more and more are developing the chronic condition.Diabetes UK points out that the disease is more aggressive in young people than in adults, leading to a higher risk of complications developing earlier. These include blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure.“Type 2 diabetes can be devastating for children and young people,” said Bridget Turner, director of policy and campaigns, calling for greater commitment across society to measures for tackling obesity.“We need to encourage healthy living by providing clear and easy-to-understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar,” she said.Viner called for the government to get on with introducing measures such as the curbs on TV adverts for junk food and supermarket promotions that it has proposed in its revised obesity plan, much of which is now in consultation.“For many children, the development of type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes but this isn’t easy – they need support. That’s why we were pleased to see the ambitious proposals set out in chapter 2 of its childhood obesity plan – we urge the government to maximise their impact by introducing them all and doing so quickly,” he said.Caroline Cerny, lead for the Obesity Health Alliance, an umbrella group, said it was hugely concerning to see so many young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. “We know that obesity contributes to the development of this and other serious health conditions, and with one in three children leaving primary school with excess weight or obesity, these findings are worrying but sadly not surprising,” she said.“What they highlight is the need for urgent action from government to help children and young people lead healthier lives. That’s why we want to see restrictions on junk food marketing before the 9pm watershed on TV, with similar restrictions applied online, action on the promotion of unhealthy products in shops, and industry going further to reduce sugar and calories from processed foods – all measures which can help families make healthy choices and prevent young people from developing potentially devastating diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09c2b6b85d5658ff25c3d86ba802f498d4014d5/0_266_5547_3328/master/5547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d727d0fb5d1093222b52defd5db4427f","title":"dylan hartley jamie george england australia manu tuilagi rugby union","story":"Dylan Hartley has been left out of Eddie Jones’s starting XV to face Australia while Manu Tuilagi is in line a first England appearance for more than two and a half years after also being named on the bench.Hartley was also among the replacements against Japan last Saturday but, with Jones selecting his first-choice side to face the Wallabies, his omission from the starting lineup is significant. He is listed as co-captain, along with Owen Farrell, but Jamie George has been named to make his seventh England start.Against Samoa last year Hartley was also on the bench but, much like against Japan, that was an experimental team selection by Jones. He was also absent against France during this year’s Six Nations because of a calf injury, as well as the three summer Tests against South Africa as a result of concussion, but last week Jones hinted that he may be used more as a replacement.Tuilagi meanwhile, is set for his first cap since the 2016 Six Nations and only his second under Jones after coming through Wednesday’s make-or-break training session. He was rated by Jones as very doubtful on Monday but has since been deemed fit enough to be included. Joe Cokanasiga keeps his place on the wing after an impressive debut against Japan, helped by the withdrawal of Jack Nowell with a hamstring injury. Jonny May returns on the other wing after being rested for the 35-15 win over the Brave Blossoms.Ben Te’o and Henry Slade return at centre, while Ben Youngs is back at scrum-half and both props are changed, with Ben Moon and Kyle Sinckler starting. In the second row Jones has selected Maro Itoje alongside Courtney Lawes for the first time in his tenure while Brad Shields and Sam Underhill both return to form the same back row that started against New Zealand, alongside Mark Wilson.The No 8 Nathan Hughes is among the replacements, having returned from suspension, taking his place along with the Exeter props Alec Hepburn and Harry Williams, the second-row Charlie Ewels, Richard Wigglesworth and George Ford.“We’ve picked our best 23 for the Australia game,” said Jones. “We know they have a unique style of attack so our ability to defend that is going to be important. We are continually working on our strengths, which is our set piece and our defence, and they are areas that are progressing nicely. I’m really happy with the direction we’re going in terms of the way we play the game. We are developing a unique style of rugby, which is English and the players are proud to play that way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed423bbb7f914872ebadda23b781fa891041bc1/0_107_4526_2715/master/4526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42221043f84b654f1b3e972951cda6fd","title":"magnus carlsen v fabiano caruana world chess championship game 10 live","story":"Hello and welcome to Game 10 of the World Chess Championship between Norway’s Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana of the United States. We’re looking at a 4½-all deadlock after nine games in 13 days, no closer to a verdict than when we started. We have, however, borne witness to a bit of history: The nine straight draws represent the longest streak of games to open a match without a decisive result in the recognized 132-year history of world championship matches.Carlsen, 27, has been ranked No 1 for eight straight years and was considered the world’s best player even before he defeated Viswanathan Anand for the title in 2013. Caruana, 26, is ranked No 2, having earned his place at the table by winning the candidates tournament in March. No American-born player has won or even competed for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972.\u0026nbspIt marks the first title match between the world\u0027s top two players since 1990, when Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov faced off for a fifth and final time.\u0026nbspThe match will consist of 12 classical games with each player awarded one point for a win and a half-point for a draw. Whoever reaches six and a half points first will be declared the champion.The time control for each game is 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, 50 minutes for the next 20 moves and then 15 minutes for the rest of the game plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players cannot agree to a draw before Black\u0027s 30th move.\u0026nbspIf the match is tied after 12 games, tie-breaks will be played on the final day in the following order:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• Best of four rapid games with 25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp• If still tied, they will play up to five mini-matches of two blitz games (five minutes for each player with a three-second increment).\u0026nbsp• If all five mini-matches are drawn, one sudden-death \u0027Armegeddon\u0027 match will be played where White receives five minutes and Black receives four minutes. Both players will receive a three-second increment after the 60th move. In the case of a draw, Black will be declared the winner.Thu 8 Nov – Opening ceremony Fri 9 Nov – Game 1\u0026nbspSat 10 Nov – Game 2 Sun 11 Nov – Rest day Mon 12 Nov – Game 3 Tue 13 Nov – Game 4 Wed 14 Nov – Rest day Thu 15 Nov – Game 5 Fri 16 Nov – Game 6 Sat 17 Nov – Rest day Sun 18 Nov – Game 7 Mon 19 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 8 Tue 20 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Wed 21 Nov – Game 9 Thu 22 Nov –\u0026nbspGame 10 Fri 23 Nov –\u0026nbspRest day Sat 24 Nov – Game 11 Sun 25 Nov – Rest day Mon 26 Nov – Game 12 Tue 27 Nov – Rest day Wed 28 Nov – Tie-break gamesAwards and closingThe games commence each day at 3pm in London.A brief recap of how we got here: Game 1 was a grueling seven-hour, 115-move staredown, where Carlsen nearly become the first defending champion to win the opening game of a world championship with the black pieces in 37 years. The next four contests – Game 2, Game 3, Game 4 and Game 5 – were mostly safer, straightforward affairs where Caruana was able to get his teeth in the match. The tension ramped up in Friday’s Game 6 when Carlsen was outplayed by Caruana in the middlegame and pushed to the limit before saving a draw with incredibly precise defending. They played to another draw in Sunday’s Game 7, a result that left the champion lamenting his gun-shy play as white. In Monday’s Game 8, Carlsen found himself down nearly an hour on the clock facing a dangerous position as black, until one false step by the American allowed him to hold for a draw. Then came yesterday’s Game 9, where it was Caruana’s turn to suffer until he was bailed out by a Carlsen inaccuracy and held for another peaceful result.Nine games, nine draws. Will today be the day that first blood is finally drawn? We’ll soon find out when Caruana makes the first move as white at the top of the hour.Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here’s his report from Wednesday’s ninth game. A freshly bruised Magnus Carlsen came dangerously close to landing a decisive blow in Wednesday’s ninth game of his tightly wound defense of the world chess championship against Fabiano Caruana in London, until a moment of impatience allowed his opponent off the hook and left the best-of-12-games match no closer to resolution in a 4½-all deadlock.The 27-year-old champion, sporting a bandage over a black eye absorbed in a collision with a Norwegian journalist during a kickabout on Tuesday’s rest day, harried the American challenger out of his preparation early and pushed him to the brink of disaster in the middlegame, but one rushed misstep gifted Caruana the slack he required to hold for a 58-move draw with three classical games remaining and the gnawing spectre of a tie-breaker looming ever larger.“I felt like I had a comfortable advantage and then I just blew it,” a clearly disappointed Carlsen said in the immediate aftermath. “I was poor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e4af18288d040f273d75fdfa17de426336a5371/0_68_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=667b49db10255415b5e0dd9c2cd563cb","title":"dont forget the birds review live theatre newcastle","story":"Live theatre, NewcastlePlaying themselves with humour, grace and honesty, a former inmate and her daughter tell their story and reveal their bondCheryl and Abigail Byron are on adjacent chairs moving to the beat of Tilted by Christine and the Queens. They fold arms, stretch out and lock legs in unison. But their synchronisation doesn’t tell the whole story. This mother and daughter may be intimate, but not enough to express the enormity of what they’ve been through. The sadness lies in what they are unable to say.The same routine, punchily choreographed by Mona McCarthy, is repeated towards the end of the show, this time with more poignancy still. By then, we have a sense of Cheryl’s real-life stretch in prison (she got two-and-a-half years for an unspecified crime involving cocaine and a lap-dancing club) and Abigail’s adjustment to living without a mother. Like soldiers returning from battle, they have no words to do justice to the intensity of their experience, be it the shock of seeing a dead body in a neighbouring cell or the newfound responsibility of keeping the house clean with mum away.The skill of Catrina McHugh’s play, developed with the Byrons, is the way it unfolds organically from the banal to the dysfunctional. We get school reports and domestic violence, childhood holidays and alcohol binges. Playing themselves with dry humour, physical grace and matter-of-fact honesty, Cheryl and Abigail make no special pleas and few cries of injustice. Instead, they talk on their own terms, rejecting the role of victim while acknowledging the stresses. As often as not, these are the little things, such as Cheryl asking permission to get out of the bath as if she were still in prison, making the play less about crime and punishment than about rehabilitation and restoring balance.Directed by Laura Lindow, Don’t Forget the Birds is part of a theatrical movement pioneered by Grassmarket Projects and finessed by Glas(s) Performance that smudges the line between life and art. Marking the 20th anniversary of the women-centred Open Clasp, it picks up a strand in the company’s award-winning show Key Change to see what happens to a prisoner after release.

Will a new laptop costing £200 or an old MacBook do the job?My eight-year-old daughter uses a computer at school, and she has asked for one for Christmas so she can do her projects at home. I am a single parent on a real tight budget so I’d prefer something for £150 or maybe £200 at a push. I was looking at a Lenovo but was told there was not a lot of space on it, and it would soon fill up, especially if she played a few games as well.Is there something you could recommend?I have been given a really old Apple MacBook – I think it’s from 2013. Is that worth wiping clean for her? SueThe key question is: what software does your daughter need in order to do projects at home? Can you get a copy? Some educational software only runs on one platform, and there is not much point in buying a laptop that doesn’t run it.In general, I expect most children create projects in Microsoft Office – which is free for educational use – or Google’s free online equivalent Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Microsoft’s OneNote is particularly popular in schools.If that’s the case, your child should be able to do everything online. In other words, she can log on with a Microsoft account and then create and save all her files in the online OneDrive, or log on with a Google account and create and save files in the online Google Drive. (Remember to back them up to a USB thumb-drive or SD card.)And if she can do everything in a browser, it doesn’t much matter which type of system she uses. It can be a Windows or Linux laptop or desktop, a MacBook or a Chromebook.There is some advantage to using a familiar system, so you could find out what your daughter uses in school, and buy the same type of device. Most British schools use Windows laptops, and some use Chromebooks. Windows laptops are more capable and more versatile, but they require much more management, in terms of installing updates and cleaning up storage space.Chromebooks can do most of the things young children – and some adults – need, but there are drawbacks. For example, some eight-year-olds are getting into Minecraft. There are versions that run on a wide variety of systems, but modern Chromebooks are limited to running the Android version of Minecraft from the Play Store.Most new Chromebooks are capable of running Android apps, but older machines may not be.If you have a 2013 MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, then it should still be capable of doing the things young children – and most adults – need. Apple fitted machines with fourth- and fifth-generation Core i5 chips in 2013. If your MacBook has an Intel Core i5-4258U or similar processor, it will be faster than most of the cheap Windows laptops sold today. It will also have a better keyboard and screen.To find out what kind of MacBook you have, go to the Apple menu and select About this Mac. Select the serial number in the popup box, copy it (Cmd+C), and paste it (Cmd+V) into Apple’s “Check Coverage” page. EveryMac is also an invaluable source of details about all types of Mac.If your free MacBook has an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor, it’s well worth using. If it has Intel’s older Core 2 Duo chip, you could sell it on eBay or a similar site. It could make a significant difference to your budget. Of course, you should remove any personal data first, if whoever gave it you didn’t do this already. (They should have.)You were probably warned against buying a Windows laptop with only 2GB of memory and 32GB of storage. If so, I echo that advice. These cheap, minimum-spec devices work quite well for casual use as netbooks where you do everything online. However, sooner or later you will run out of storage space and need to plug in an external hard drive to do Windows updates.In my view, 4GB of memory is the minimum sensible specification for both Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and 64GB of storage is the minimum for Windows laptops. (If I’m buying, I go for 8GB and at least 128GB.)Screen size is more a matter of personal choice. Mainstream laptops usually have 15.6in screens and are fine for use around the house. More portable laptops tend to have screens between 10in and 14in, with 11.6in and 14in being popular compromises.With Black Friday coming up, you may be able to pick up a bargain. I have not done an exhaustive search, but some models I would have mentioned are already out of stock, or have now increased in price.The best budget laptop I can find at the moment is the 14in Lenovo Ideapad 120S, which costs £149.98 at eBuyer. This has 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage, and the previously mentioned Pentium N4200 processor. A search for 81A5007KUK finds that Lenovo is selling this machine for £279.99.Prices vary, of course, but you should be able to find the right sort of spec on your budget. And if you miss Black Friday, prices are often cheaper in the DecemberJanuary sales.Whichever system you buy, you should be the administrator while your daughter should have a limited Child account. This enables you to control what she does, and in Windows, makes her more secure.Microsoft provides instructions on setting up a Child account, though Windows Central’s version has screen shots that make it easier to follow.Apple has instructions on how to set up an Apple ID for your child, while Macworld does it with screenshots and safety tips.There are also third-party parental control programs for Windows and MacOS, including free ones. You can use these with standard (not administrator) accounts instead of child accounts.For Chromebooks, see Google’s Sign your child in on their Chromebook, using an account created with Family Link.Google says the information it collects “won’t be used to personalise ads for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your country)”. In most European countries, children have to be 16+ to have their own Google account, but the UK defaults to the US age, which is 13+.This may be more complicated if you comply with data protection regulations, which weren’t around when I last set up child accounts. Back then, I didn’t use real names or ages either.Have you got a question?

It’s at the end of a long and bumpy road, the village isn’t particularly attractive and the beach is scruffy grey sand. But the fish is up there with the best you’ll ever taste. The menu is simple: they show you a bunch of fish, you pick the one you want, it’s cooked how you like and served with your choice of sides. On the Sunday afternoon we visited there was a sound system on the beach. The music progressed gloriously from gospel through soul to reggae as the place filled up with diners from across the island. Prices were reasonable and aimed at locals. John McLavertyEvery Friday night, the fishing town of Oistins, on the south coast of Barbados, comes alive with the weekly fish fry. As soon as the sun sets, locals and visitors arrive for fish including marlin, tuna, flying fish and swordfish, caught that day and available fried or grilled to order from dozens of vendors, alongside traditional local dishes such as macaroni pie and goat curry. A meal and a drink can be had for under £10. Other stalls sell local arts and crafts, with DJs and live music contributing to the party atmosphere.Harry AgarA food tour in Havana showed us how Cuban chefs are serving up world-class food amid restrictions and shortages. Our guide, Danny, took us out of Havana to Cojímar (Hemingway’s fishing haunt), to the allotments and later the kitchens of a family-run paladar. Here, we learned to mix mojitos, made traditional ropa vieja (stewed beef and veg dish) and sampled octopus in garlic. Back in downtown Havana, we visited Michelin-starred chef Alberto’s bakery, where prices are kept low to ensure that the delicious artisan bread is affordable for local people.

With the mountains of the Cordillera Central as a backdrop, the springs were lovely enough by day but even more magical at night. Visitors can relax in or beside the pools, heated naturally to bath-like temperatures. Soft music accompanies low-level shifting coloured lights, while the island’s endemic coquí frogs chirp from the bushes. Puerto Rican culture is fast and furious, so this unexpected retreat was truly a haven. And entrance was only $3 per person. puertoricodaytripsRachel MackeyWith SeaCat tours we drove and hiked through the amazing jungle landscape of this island, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria. Octavius Lugay, who runs SeaCat, is knowledgable and humorous and is proud of his island and keen to share it. We stopped and tasted wild fruit amid rich wafts of herbs. We swam up a gorge featured in Pirates of the Caribbean, then ed down the waterfall at the top. Lunch in a forest restaurant was excellent and the hike to the volcanic boiling lake – the world’s second largest – in the Unesco-listed Morne Trois Pitons national park is said to be awe-inspiring. Jennifer SmithThe jerk pork at Jo Jo’s Jerk Hut off Waterloo Road, Kingston, is superb. While living in Jamaica I became a very loyal customer. On Thursday night they do karaoke – it’s hilarious! Just as you enter the car park you’ll see a tiny garden shed on your right. That’s my favourite bar: it doesn’t have a name but it’s been around for years. I used to play dominos there or would just sit and people-watch. I was told not to go out alone as a foreign female visitor in Kingston. Obviously, you should take care, but my experience didn’t match the warnings. I loved it. JoThe No 1 bus in Grenada gets you from the tourist areas like Grand Anse to the capital, St George’s. The minibus is usually crammed with locals going to and from work. The fare is passed along by the other passengers and when you want to get off you have to loudly knock twice on the inside of the roof so the driver can hear above the sounds of reggae. And all this for about 70p. Susan KosterAll of the scenery without lots of visitors and cruise ships. You’ll find backpackers on the coral island of Caye Caulker, with its lagoon and mangroves honeymooners in Placencia, with its long white sand beach and the best that Belize has to offer culturally in Hopkins, a village with strong Garifuna (an ethnically mixed people who speak Arawakan) heritage. Don’t miss Cockscomb Basin wildlife preserve just outside Hopkins, where jaguars are still present and you can follow trails that range from leisurely strolls to scrambling up rock faces, with waterfalls and pools to reward you at the top. Take your own rum and refreshments there – after paying the $5 entry fee at the booth six miles outside of the park, there aren’t many concessions to tourists. Guides can be hired for wildlife spotting, but I think that would spoil the fun. • belizeaudubon.orgPhoebe Thompson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9f8651d18769aa98bc4cfbe1d7d4ba89e728a4d/0_533_7952_4771/master/7952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b289af27539a69a870b17bf3c8d43ede","title":"blog i now appreciate something i have masculine strengths that i should be proud of","story":"Alexi Duggins has spent seven weeks trying to become a better man (and writing about it along the way). As he hangs up his blogging boots, what has he learned?I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about men over the past few weeks. I’ve fixated on men with peachy soft faces, dreamt about charismatic men, and let my mind linger over men who have chiselled their rock-hard bodies into muscular perfection. With the amount of time I’ve devoted to my idea of the perfect man, my recent marriage to a woman is looking like a waste of a potentially killer Grindr profile.For seven weeks, I’ve been trying to figure out what being a man means to me. The way that I’ve done that is by immersing myself in the accumulated learnings of the experts on male identity who contributed to Philips’ What Makes a Man campaign. I’ve tried stepping away from ideas of toxic masculinity and embraced being kind to myself. I’ve wrestled with the idea of what other people think of me. And so rigorously did I research appropriate techniques for working out that I ended up chafing my bum bone with poorly executed sit-ups. I know: I’m a pro.In the past, I haven’t felt comfortable thinking of myself as a man. I often didn’t think that I fitted into society’s idea of masculinity, what with my penchant for board games and immersive theatre not exactly putting me into the same category of maleness as Jason Statham (I know, hard to believe from those rugged photos of me). Frankly, I wasn’t even sure that I was mature enough to count as a man.I’ve learned something over the past few weeks, though: I’m actually fairly far down the road to being a man. The main reason I say that? I’ve had an important realisation: I’m totally comfortable with myself. Obviously, to an extent, I’ve always known this. I mean, I wouldn’t stealthily unfollow myself on Facebook, cross the road to avoid me or invent an excuse to avoid chatting to myself at a party. I think I’m an OK kind of guy.But as I spent a week practising the art of kindfulness – ie trying to be kind to yourself in a soothingly mindful manner – I started to think more about the way I treat myself. And I began to realise that I actually already did quite a lot of the recommendations of kindfulness: ie to not be hard on yourself and to accept yourself as you are.A few weeks later, it was time for me to try out exercise routines to see what suited me. And, frankly, I just didn’t want to do anything that approached most people’s idea of exercise: no thrusting, squatting or practising getting out of bed (or sit-ups or whatever they’re called). No matter what the benefits for giving me a rock hard tum-tum, I didn’t want to do them, and I realised that I was totally comfortable with just saying: “Nope. That’s not me.

Earl Forlales, 23, a graduate in material science engineering, took inspiration from the bamboo hut his grandparents lived in outside Manilla.Forlales was awarded first prize by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) for his house, known as Cubo, for its use of low-cost, sustainable material, and the speed at which it could be constructed.John Hughes, the competition head judge and Rics president, said: “The world’s cities are growing all the time and there is a real need to make sure they are safe, clean and comfortable places to live for future generations.“There were many exciting, original designs among the submissions. However, Earl’s idea stood out for its simple yet well thought through solution to the world’s growing slum problem.“As we look at our entrants, who are our next generation of leaders, I believe that real progress will be made in tackling the world’s biggest issues.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theForlales has already identified a suitable area of land to start building his Cubo houses. He plans to begin work next year with experts from the Rics in an attempt to help relieve the huge pressures on housing in Manila, where a third of the 12 million population live in slums.He said: “This is a huge step forward to helping the people of Manila. The state of housing in the city is at crisis point, and will undoubtedly get worse with this new influx of workers.“Cubo started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent’s house – it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality.“I would like to thank Rics for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world.”The Cities for our Future competition launched in January 2018 aiming to find practical solutions to problems that the world’s cities face.

File photograph: Daniel LawPA WireOn the surface, gadget insurance makes sense in a world in which a smart phone costing €1,000 can be all too easily ripped from a careless hand by a canny criminal or smashed into pieces if dropped onto an unforgiving floor tile.Compared to the potential losses, the pricing of many policies look attractive. Some premiums start at less than €10 a month, and salespeople - sometimes operating on hefty commissions - can make the proposition seem very attractive.Anyone with such a policy who has even fallen victim to crime connected to their device or lost their phone in a pub or seen it fall and smash on a hard floor and then gone on to make a successful claim will certainly sing its praises. But for all those who have benefited from having gadget insurance, there are others who have paid premiums faithfully only to find out that when they need to make a claim - for whatever reason - the small print is working against them. There are others who don’t understand or who were never told that some gadget insurance policies can run for as long as five years unless cancelled by the policy holder and as a result continue to pay premiums for gadgets that they no longer have any use for.There are more who only sign up for such products because of a hard sell and - ultimately - have no idea what they are paying for. Such confusion is always going to work against the consumer Recent studies from the ESRI and its reviews of international literature suggest that when a financial product has too many features consumer frequently make the wrong decisions - and in many instances “too many” means more than two or three features. The ERSI also highlights that consumers often agree to add-on insurance at the point of sale due to emotional and other factors that can prompt what is known as “decision fatigue” - which “limits a consumer’s ability to fully understand the terms and conditions, for example, if an excess applies, and the overall cost of the insurance,” the Central Bank says.All too often when people make claims they find their cover is not as broad as they assumed because the list of exclusions can be long. Moreover, payouts can be denied with little or no room for appeal.There is also a lack of awareness of what needs to be done ahead of making a claim, and this means many people who have legitimate claims lose out because they don’t take the right steps in the right time frame. Others are disappointed when they realise they are not automatically entitled to a new device if something happens to an existing one.Sometimes excesses are so high as to make claims pointless, while people are frequently unaware they need to update their insurance every time they update their phone and that failure to do so could lead to a person paying a premium on the double.That is not to say such insurance policies are worthless - far from it. They can save consumers a lot of financial heartache - and, at more than 90 per cent, the acceptance rate for claims is impressive. But if this report tells us nothing else, it tells us that knowledge is power and consumers need to more to inform themselves as to what they are buying while those doing the selling need to do more to make the acquisition of that knowledge easier.

The only place I could buy insurance was at the point of sale in the phone shop, and I did feel under pressure as I signed up to cover at a cost of €15 a month”. She says she didn’t mind paying the €15 “because it gave me real peace of mind”.Fast forward 18 months to May 2016 . Ms Halpin was studying for exams when she dropped her phone onto some hard and unforgiving tiles. “It smashed into several pieces, it wasn’t just the screen that broke. I called the company and explained what happened, and they told me to send my phone off for examination I did send the phone off, and then a few weeks later I got it back with a simple note saying the company doesn’t cover this type of damage.”Ms Halpin says the letter contained some diagnostic information she “didn’t really understand” but no other information. She sent off the phone a second time and then a third time, but her claim was repeatedly rejected. “I didn’t understand why. I briefly considered hoaxing them and saying it had been stolen as I thought that would be covered, but I figured it might be bad karma so I didn’t.”She went back to her mobile provider - which had sold her the insurance in the first place but was told it no longer dealt with that particular insurance company “so I was effectively on my own”.Ms Halpin says she now feels like she “completely wasted all that money I was paying €15 a month for 18 months which means I had spent over €200 on phone insurance that proved to be absolutely useless when the time came to make a claim.

Without proof of purchase making any claim can be very difficult.

Some policies make holders report damage within 24 hours or as little as 12 hours.Don’t forget to report any theft or loss as a result of a crime to the police. Failure to do so equals no payout.Don’t lie and claim a product was stolen if you in fact dropped it down the toilet. That way lies a world of pain.Do remember to cancel the policy if a new one is purchased or an existing one reaches an old age. Premiums can roll over in perpetuity.Do consider self-insurance - put the cost of a premium aside each month and use your fund should anything go wrong. This only works if you can get through the first year or so with the product unscathed.Don’t go for the cheapest deal. Check the terms and conditions and make sure the policy is what you want it to be.Do check what is covered and not covered. Policy documents can be long and tedious and impossible to read. The good news is you don’t have to actually read them all. Open the terms and conditions on on a computer and search for the phrase “not covered” and the words “excluded and exclusion”.Do pay particular attention to the get-out clauses insurance companies have.

File photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty The EU and UK have renewed their commitment to replace the “backstop” solution to avoid a hard Irish border in future talks on a post-Brexit relationship.Both sides said in a political declaration published today - which sets out a roadmap to guide negotiations on a trade deal - that they will consider “facilitative arrangements and technologies” in developing “alternative arrangements” to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland. The inclusion of potential technological solutions to avoid infrastructure on the Border is a concession to the UK as British prime minister Theresa May tries to win over Eurosceptic Conservatives opposed to the “backstop” solution for the Border in the draft withdrawal agreement.The draft Brexit treaty - the orce deal setting out the terms of the UK’s exit from the EU in March - includes the fall-back “backstop” solution that would keep the UK as a whole in a customs territory with the EU with additional rules for Northern Ireland to maintain an invisible Irish border.In the declaration, both sides “recall their determination that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.”The aspirational declaration is aimed at preparing the ground for talks on the future relationship between the EU and the UK in which both sides say they want a better solution to the Border issue. Broadly, the document sets out hopes that both sides can agree “comprehensive arrangements” to create a “free trade area” for the free movement of goods across borders to avoid customs checks.In addition to technology solving border issues, the declaration outlines the intention of the EU and the UK to consider “mutual recognition of trusted traders’ programmes, administrative co-operation in customs matters and mutual assistance, including for the recovery of claims related to taxes and duties.”Both sides also intend to consider the exchange of information “to combat customs fraud and other illegal activity,” according to the declaration.“Such facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing,” the document says, in a reference to potential alternative solutions to the backstop.The declaration commits to protect the Common Travel Area arrangements between the UK and Ireland that protect the free movement of people and special status social and political rights for people.There is specific mention of protecting the operation of the Dublin-Belfast “Enterprise” train the EU and UK say that there should be “bilateral arrangements” established for cross-border rail services “to facilitate the continued smooth functioning and operation of rail services.”There is a declaration to achieve “comprehensive, close, balanced and reciprocal law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters” taking into account “the geographic proximity” of the EU and UK and the “mutual benefits of the safety and security of their citizens.”The EU and UK stress the importance of protecting the Northern Ireland peace process and the 1998 Belfast Agreement in the declaration affirming that the “achievements, benefits and commitments” of the peace process “will remain of paramount importance to peace, stability and reconciliation.”The document recognises that the peace agreement “must be protected in all its parts” and that this extends to the “practical application” of the accord “on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 agreement.”Both sides recall their shared commitment to protect and maintain funding to peace programmes “to sustain work on reconciliation and a shared future in Northern Ireland.”The declaration sets out the intention to allow British subjects to continue participating in EU programmes in areas including science and innovation, and youth, culture and education, which would cover the continued participation of Northern Irish students in the Erasmus exchange programme.Other areas covered include overseas development and external action, and defence capabilities. There is a commitment in the agreement to continue “fair and appropriate financial contribution” to enable the “sound financial management” by the EU and UK on these areas of co-operation. It is intended, under the terms of the declaration, that the future relationship will include dialogue between the EU and UK “at summit, ministerial and technical level, as well as at parliamentary level” and that both sides should encourage “civil society dialogue.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706749.1542882733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"national broadband plan everything you need to know","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten: An independent audit found the National Broadband Plan has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications  had with the sole remaining bidder. Photograph: Cyril ByrneWhat is happening with the National Broadband Plan (NBP)?  It hasn’t been abandoned, that’s what. An independent audit of the process has found that it has not been fatally undermined by private meetings the former minister for communications Denis Naughten had with David McCourt, the Irish-American businessman who is leading the sole remaining bidder for the contract. That report has not been published yet, but reports say it has given the process the go-ahead. It’s expected the full report will be published later this week or early next week.So what happens now? The tender for the project, submitted by the group led by McCourt, is being assessed by officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It is reportedly 20,000 pages long and the assessment process involves examination by legal and technical experts. The Government expects to be in a position to make a decision on the awarding of the contract within a few weeks.Who are the other bidders? There aren’t any.Really? Other bidders, including telecoms company Eir and a consortium involving the ESB, all dropped out, leaving McCourt’s bid as the only one.If there’s only one bidder, isn’t that likely to push up the price? This is one of the fears – though there are others – in Government. The original estimates for the cost to the exchequer of the programme were in the region of €500 million. However, Government sources have told The  that the estimated costs for the project have ballooned – with some fearing the final cost could be as high as €3 billion. This has caused alarm in the Department of Finance, whose job it is to be alarmed about these things. These estimates have been disputed by industry figures, but they are the sort of sums that have featured in discussions on the broadband plan in Government.Is that for the entire country? No. Most of the country is covered – or will be covered – by commercial operators. The National Broadband Plan is just for remote and rural areas that the commercial telcos won’t touch because they can’t make them pay. So the State has promised to step in and provide high-speed fibre-optic broadband for the remainder of the homes and premises in the country. There are about 540,000 homes and premises covered by the NBP.What are the other concerns? There are two principal ones. The first is that the take-up of broadband services when the network is built is highly uncertain. Many of the 540,000 houses desperately want broadband. But some of the houses are holiday homes. Some of them are unoccupied. Some of them are home to people who aren’t that interested in having broadband. Government sources point to the example of Eir, which has offered, it says, broadband to 200,000 rural homes so far. The take-up is about 14 per cent. Broadband campaigners say that the Eir service isn’t actually available for everyone, but even still, the take-up is pretty low. Some people in Government are worried that they are going to build this network at great expense and only a minority of people will use it. The second issue is the ownership of the network once it is built. Although the State will have paid for it, the actual network – the pipes and wires, etc – will be owned by the company that builds it.Will the Government swallow its reservations? It will have to decide in the coming weeks, once the legal and technical evaluation of the bid is completed by the Department of Communications. It is not obliged to accept the bid, but refusing it would mean the entire project goes back to square one. That would be a huge embarrassment to the Government, and a political hit in rural areas. The choice is between making a decision that many in Government to be financially unwise, and one that is politically unwise."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"John Allen Chau\u0026rsquos diary reveals contact with tribespeople the day before he diedAir quality rated \u0026lsquovery poor\u0026rsquo in east and southwest and \u0026lsquohazardous\u0026rsquo in northwest of cityPolice say victim was illegally ferried by fishermen to North Sentinel IslandMajor sponsors pull out of parade amid criticism of organisers\u0026rsquo decisionEducation a priority for parents in a competitive society where \u0026lsquoTiger Moms\u0026rsquo aboundChinese influence set to grow as Xi Jinping\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoproject of the century\u0026rsquo progressesFirst trials of Umbrella movement activists take place amid intense public interestChinese business looking for innovative answers as US president piles on tariffsWith China\u0026rsquos new power come challenges going forwardMilitary test could sour political atmosphere amid stalled talks with United StatesCourt finds 1975-79 regime targeted Cham and Vietnamese people to create \u0026lsquoan atheistic and homogenous society without class isions\u0026rsquoFlorida-based firm files suit against Boeing on behalf of parents of doctor killed in crashBangladesh had begun preparations to repatriate an initial batch of 2,200 RohingyaYoshitaka Sakurada (68) \u0026lsquoalways directed my staff and secretaries to do that kind of thing\u0026rsquoDemand to rename Agra, the city of the 17th-century Taj Mahal, is most curiousUN rights boss urging Bangladesh to halt plans over concerns for refugees\u0026rsquo safetyGovernment postpones lifting of 25-year ban on use of body parts in traditional medicineTokyo Letter: World\u0026rsquos third-largest economy seeks to revive ageing, declining populationRefugees should be able to assess if conditions in Myanmar are safe for return, says UN agencyFarm supervisor My Ut Trinh to remain in custody after scare that rocked industry"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3706983.1542895677!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another brexit document agreed what does this one mean","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday (November 22) that a draft declaration on post-Brexit ties with the European Union had been agreed with the European Commission and that she would seal the deal on Sunday.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish Prime Minister Theresa May  outside  Downing Street, London on Thursday. Photograph: Andy RainEPAAnother Brexit document agreed ? What’s this one?The EU and UK have agreed a draft text on how their their future relationship will look after Brexit. This follows the finalisation of the draft withdrawal agreement last week. Both documents will go to a summit of EU leaders on Sunday next, November 25th, for political approval. The withdrawal agreement, 580 pages of dense legal text, deals broadly with the terms on which the UK will part from the EU next March. The 26-page political declaration on the future relationship is the first step to sketching out how the two sides will relate in future, in trade, security and other areas. However the actual negotiation of this future relationship will only take place after the UK leaves the EU.But this all still depends on it getting through the House of Commons ?Yes, it does. If Theresa May loses the House of Commons vote expected next month, then nobody is quite sure what happens next.The point is that neither the withdrawal agreement nor the declaration are agreed yet. As well as the UK vote, the European Parliament also needs to approve the deal and final sign-off by the EU council would not happen until close to departure date. What are the key points in the new political declaration?It aims for an ambitious future relationship, which could develop over time though points out that the UK cannot expect to retain the right of membership. The future trading relationship between the two sides will be as “close as possible” , it says and involve a “free-trade area” and “ deep regulatory and customs co-operation”. This is good news for Ireland, as the UK accounts for 13 per cent of our exports – and close to 40 per cent in the food sector – and more than 25 per cent of our imports and the less damage to these, the less the impact of Brexit on our economy.However t he UK will leave the EU trading bloc – and so whatever new arrangements are put in place are likely to lead to some level of cost for us. Trade will not be “frictionless” as it is now, in the jargon. However it promises to align the two trading blocs could limit border checks and a commitment to have no tariffs is good news for the food sector, as it the promise to maintain the same animal health regimes in the UK and EU. The document says the goal will be to minimise bureaucracy. There will be years negotiating all this, assuming it is all agreed, which is far from certain given the state of UK politics. And in many areas the UK will face the same decison as it has faced all along – does it stay close to the EU in certain areas, but then accept the price of abiding by more and more rules and regulations set in Brussels. What about the Irish Border?While the withdrawal agreement largely dealt with the “orce” terms, it also included the much-discussed Irish Border backstop – the guarantee that no matter how the trade talks play out, there will be no hard Border on the island of Ireland. Ireland has said it is happy that this gives a solid guarantee, though the concept has proved hugely controversial as it would still probably involve some new checks on goods crossing from Britain into the North and leave the North more closely tied to EU rules.Previously the UK side had raised the prospect of technology and new processes such as special licences for big trading companies being used to avoid border checks. This was shot down in this discussions as not being a practical way to avoid a hard Border.The political declaration says that both sides agree that they will try to replace the backstop with alternative, permanent arrangements to avoid a hard Border, most likely via future trading arrangements. However the technology issue also resurfaces, with a commitment that “facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing”.This could be presented to Brexiteers and the DUP as a way out of the backstop by Theresa May. However Ireland will point out that the original legal guarantee remains in the withdrawal agreement and that nobody has yet applied such technology anywhere else. With a joint EUUK committee overseeing the withdrawal agreement and various appeal mechanisms, the whole Border and backstop issue could be with us for many years to come, if this deal gets through.The future relationship is not all about trade and so the declaration also includes sections on areas like foreign policy, security and deference co-operation, data protection, confronting illegal immigration and law enforcement . It deals with restrictions on freedom-of-movement between the EU and UK - pledging to try to protect holiday travel, but making clear new controls will be in place for longer-term stays. However for Ireland and the UK the common travel area will remain in place, meaning that Irish residents can continue to live and work in the UK and visa versa.So in summary?There is a lot of aspiration in this document and a huge amount still to be negotiated after the UK leaves the EU, if this deal holds. However if it is voted down in the UK parliament then we will enter a new period of uncertainty about what happens next. All sides say they are intent on avoiding a “no deal” Brexit, but if the UK cannot accept this agreement, then fears will grow of this happening.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Mr Trump said on Tuesday that our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn\u0027t!He has since faced calls from members of his own party to re-evaluate ties with the ultraconservative kingdom, but Mr Trump has said the benefits of a good relationship outweigh the possibility its own prince ordered the killing.President Donald Trump speaks to the media about Khashoggi\u0026#39s murderThe Turkish media has published a drip-drip of leaks of information since the news of the Khashoggi’s death in early October, designed to put pressure on both Riyadh and the US to respond.Riyadh initially remained silent about the 59-year-old columnist’s disappearance, before claiming that he left the consulate after a short meeting with officials.They then changed their story several times, later claiming that Khashoggi was killed by mistake in a “fistfight” gone wrong. They admitted earlier this month that he was killed and dismembered after attempts to persuade him to come home failed. Saudi today warned criticism of the prince was a red line.Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC that calls for MBS, as he is nicknamed, to be held accountable for the killing, would not be tolerated, nor would discussion of anything disparaging.Federica Mogherini, the EU\u0027s top diplomat, said on Thursday all those really responsible for the murder of journalist Khashoggi have to be held accountable.Those responsible, really responsible for this terrible murder have to be accountable, she told a news conference in Ankara.Brexit latest: Britain and EU agree \u0026#39deep and flexible\u0026#39 partnership as Theresa May to address MPsThe history of Thanksgiving day: Pies, parades and presidential pardonsComment: Only the Labour Party believes that working class kids are incapable of achieving excellence Turmoil in Kashmir as state assembly dissolved after \u0026#39faulty\u0026#39 fax machine prompts Twitter fightHuge brawl erupts in Toronto at Pusha T rap performance South Korea closes biggest dog meat slaughterhouse complex as activists push for end to customComment: The EU\u0026#39s Brexit deal histrionics are great theatre.

This is not a result of anything you have done, and there is no need for you to change your password or take any other action.The fact that only names and email addresses were affected makes\u0026nbspthe information leaked less significant than some other\u0026nbspdata breaches where credit card details have been exposed.Cyber security experts warn that despite the limited nature of the data leak, customers should still be weary about how it can be used.Cyber criminals can do a lot of damage with a large database of names and emails. The greatest risk is of brute force attacks - where criminals use a leaked email address and common password combinations to try and break into other personal accounts, Richard Walters, chief technology officer of\u0026nbspCensorNet, wrote in an email to\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspA large majority of people still use predictable passwords, and thanks to previous high-profile breaches many people\u0027s passwords are also readily available on the dark web. For cyber criminals, it then just becomes a exercise in joining the dots. This risk is amplified by the fact that many people also use their work email addresses for personal accounts or services such as AmazonMr Walters described Amazon as the white whale when it comes to e-commerce companies, meaning it is a constant target for hackers.Advice for any Amazon customer affected, or anyone concerned\u0026nbspthey might have been, is to change their passwords as a matter of priority on all online services that they use, both work and private.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has traditionally resisted Black Friday, instead running small offers but not slashing prices or offering deep discounts.In the last couple of years, for instance, the company has just offered gift cards when people bought specific products. Those gift cards have to be spent in the Apple Store and the products still sold at full price.Apple said almost nothing about this year\u0027s deals. It announced them with a mysterious set of phrases, reading only: Four days. Special offers and making clear the dates.As such, Apple\u0027s own website does not traditionally offer the best deal on the company\u0027s own products. Better offers can often be scored through other retailers – and a complete list of the best of them can be found in this list.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.”Sterling hit $1.2922, and rose 0.65 per cent against the euro to reach €1.1299. The leaked document shows that frictionless trade between the UK and the EU would come to an end after Brexit. The political declaration is the second element required to form the Brexit deal, along with the withdrawal agreement. It is understood that the draft has been approved by the European Commission, and now requires the EU member states, excluding the UK, to sign off on it. However, several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, have raised concerns that earlier drafts of the plan gives too much away to the UK.Prime Minister Theresa May was \u0026nbspplunged into a leadership crisis last week after unveiled a draft Brexit agreement, with a number of Conservative MPs vowing to vote against it. Ms May is set to deliver a statement to Parliament on Thursday afternoon. Joshua Roberts, associate at consultancy JCRA, said sterling’s spike might not be a signal that the declaration will bring about great change. “Despite the positive language, it is difficult to find much in the text that we didn’t know already,” he said. “There is a reasonable chance that the market response is the result of trading algorithms activated by a positive headline, rather than the start of a bigger move.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The old ranch in Palo Alto needed a lot of work, but the couple were excited about the prospect of turning it into their dream family home - at least initially. What started with big plans turned into builders sketching on the back of napkins and ended in expensive mistakes.“It became miserable,” Tatarko says. “After a long process and a lot of time and money that we couldn’t afford, we ended up with plans that we didn’t like and we had to throw it away and start all over again.”How Silicon Valley start-up Theranos came crashing down to earthOnigo is the startup that crosses Pokémon GO with escape roomsSex-tech startup MysteryVibe introduces wearable vibrator for men When she talked to friends and neighbours, Tatarko realised they were not alone. There was a huge gap between homeowners, who felt it was impossible to realise their grand designs, and the professionals who felt customers had high expectations and unrealistic demands.Houzz now attracts 40 million unique users a month - more than your average homeware or DIY shop. Its success comes from the determination of Tatarko and Cohen to employ the latest technology. Houzz provides tools for people to visualise products in their homes and to buy them from vendors all over the world in one click. It has disrupted two massive markets - construction and home furnishings - with a value that Tatarko estimates at $2 trillion across the US, Canada and Europe.“These industries had no technology applied to it so our question is how do we make a difference to what is still largely an offline industry,” she says. “In the early days we wanted to help people to visualise what they liked. But the next stage is, ‘Well, I like it, but will it fit in my own space, with my other stuff?’ The ability to see if it fits in your own space - this is very powerful.”So powerful, that Houzz’s visualisation tool “View In My Room 3D” makes users 11 times more likely to purchase product and materials, according to research by Houzz economists of two million users.\u0026nbspThe marketplace tool, which was introduced in the US in 2014 and launched in the UK earlier this year, has become a second stream of revenue for Houzz. Its first was a freemium model whereby subscribing professionals, like builders and architects appear higher up in the search listings of users nearby, making it easier for them to attract work.The marketplace function was part of the original plans for the site, Tatarko says: “In the first iteration of the website, Houzz had tags on products showing data about where it was sold,” she says. “But as the site expanded we started getting phone calls to the office saying, ‘We see the tag, but we don’t understand how to add it to the cart,’ or ‘Can you ship this bathtub to us in Hawaii?’”It took years to connect with suppliers to make the vision a reality. The move turned Houzz into a retailer. It now has over 16 million product photos showing all the data. Tatarko herself has used the platform to buy a rug from Denmark. “I found it on Houzz Denmark, so I placed it in my room using the visualisation feature, saw that it worked and got it shipped to my house in California, from Denmark,” she says. “We hear of professionals using the visualisation tool to show clients instead of drawing diagrams on a napkin, like I got in the early days.”Tatarko comes from a entrepreneurial family. She grew up in Israel, where her mother worked in property and her grandmother had been a fashion designer. “Because of all this I thought, wow, I don’t know if I want to have this crazy life,” she says.She worked in a small tech company in Israel in her twenties and married Alon Cohen after meeting him on a bus while travelling through Thailand. When the couple were offered the opportunity to move to New York to work in startups, they grasped the chance. “We were young and restless, so we did,” she says. “Who wouldn’t?”Tatarko found the energy of New York addictive. She loved the buzz of the city. So it was with some reluctance that she agreed to move to Silicon Valley in 2001. “That was end of the tech bubble, everyone was getting out of Silicon Valley and only my dear husband wanted to move to there. How he convinced me I have no idea!” she says. She made Cohen a deal: she would move to New York - but only if she could get out of tech. \u0026nbspHe agreed. In California, while Cohen moved up the ranks at eBay, Tatarko started a new career in finance and became the chief financial officer for a boutique investment firm. Houzz happened in the evenings and on the weekends in between raising their first two sons:\u0026nbsp “At night, when we put the kids to bed, we would work on Houzz. Alon would programme and I would talk to people in the community. All of a sudden I had way more than a full time job going on, but I really loved it.”Tatarko convinced herself she wasn’t really back in the tech world. Not thinking about it too much helped her to keep going with Houzz. But the time came when the site was too big to run in their spare time. Cohen told Tatarko that he thought they should make the leap to doing it full time - and that she should become the chief executive.“I had to breathe for a second,” she remembers. “I said I wasn’t going to work in tech any more. I said I wasn’t going to work around the clock any more.”Not only that, but she had imbedded herself in the finance world and invested in education for her new career. Did she want to go back? “But I realised that this is what gets me excited. This is where the opportunity is. So here we are! Working around the clock.”The craziness continued when the couple had their third son six months before Houzz launched in international markets. She remembers flying all over the world with him to launch new offices. “I always thought that I would only have one or two kids and that with Houzz it would be too crazy, but you go and do what you truly love and you make things work.”The new app set to help make you money from your home renovationsTatarko is tight-lipped about whether Houzz is turning a profit amid such rapid expansion and refuses to say whether they are heading towards an IPO. But she says to look out for patents in the coming months and years as the visualisation software becomes more sophisticated.And the ranch in Palo Alto? Finally finished, thanks to a request from their eldest son to hold his bar mitzvah in the garden when it was in no state to host a party. “He said, ‘Now you have an excuse to finish the home!’ So we did the exterior of the house and the garden and it was finished just one day - a single day - before the party. The builders left, we cleared up the mess, switched the lights on and it was ready. Sometimes you just need a deadline.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It would be better described as an exploitation cap.\u0026nbspThe people forced into using the sector to buy things most of us would consider essential - cookers,\u0026nbsprefrigerators\u0026nbspand the like - are some of the most vulnerable in society.\u0026nbspAccording to the watchdog, only a third are in work. Their incomes range from just £12,000 to £18,000 a year. They are likely to have missed at least one bill payment in the last six months.\u0026nbspThe developing Universal Credit debacle\u0026nbsp - the Work \u0026amp Pensions Committee this morning warned of claimants being plunged into poverty and even left destitute if things go wrong - and the benefits freeze are only making things harder for them.\u0026nbspThe FCA\u0027s report into insurance pricing is deeply troubling Payday lenders must offer compensation for mis-sold credit, says FCAConsumer groups call for FCA to impose price cap on doorstep lendingRent to own companies provide a means for them to buy things they need. But the problem is they have made a habit of gouging their customers, firstly through charging over the odds for the goods themselves, secondly through the cost of the credit they advance people to pay for them.\u0026nbspIt speaks volumes that the cap, which is due to come into force on April 1, subject to consultation, is expected to save vulnerable consumers nearly £23m a year. That’s in addition to the redress packages for around 340,000 customers of RTO firms BrightHouse, PerfectHome and Buy As You View, of nearly £16m that have already been paid out.\u0026nbspThe cap has two prongs. It will force RTO providers to benchmark their prices against what high street rivals charge, and limit the cost of credit to no more than the cost of the product being purchased. The consumer thus won’t pay more than twice the price. It’s broadly similar to the way payday lenders are limited in that respect.\u0026nbspIn addition, the point of sale addition of extended\u0026nbspwarranties will be banned through the introduction of a two day ‘cooling off period’ and there will be a programme to promote alternatives to high cost credit generally.\u0026nbspThe cap\u0026nbspsounds tough, but what you have to remember is that the FCA tends to be a fairly cautious institution, so despite the squaeling\u0026nbspyou may hear from the sector about these plans, it won’t come crashing down, just as the payday loans cap has not brought that sector crashing down (they’re still being advertised on cable and satellite TV). \u0026nbspRTO firms will still be able to impose a fairly high mark up, and turn a more than acceptable profit.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.”Sterling hit $1.2922, and rose 0.65 per cent against the euro to reach €1.1299. The leaked document shows that frictionless trade between the UK and the EU would come to an end after Brexit. The political declaration is the second element required to form the Brexit deal, along with the withdrawal agreement. It is understood that the draft has been approved by the European Commission, and now requires the EU member states, excluding the UK, to sign off on it. However, several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, have raised concerns that earlier drafts of the plan gives too much away to the UK.Prime Minister Theresa May was \u0026nbspplunged into a leadership crisis last week after unveiled a draft Brexit agreement, with a number of Conservative MPs vowing to vote against it. Ms May is set to deliver a statement to Parliament on Thursday afternoon. Joshua Roberts, associate at consultancy JCRA, said sterling’s spike might not be a signal that the declaration will bring about great change. “Despite the positive language, it is difficult to find much in the text that we didn’t know already,” he said. “There is a reasonable chance that the market response is the result of trading algorithms activated by a positive headline, rather than the start of a bigger move.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Financial Conduct Authority said some customers are paying as much as four times the average retail price for essential household goods like washing machines or cookers, due to extra charges such as add-on insurance and warranties imposed by RTO firms.According to the FCA, customers who use these companies are “some of the most financially vulnerable in our society”, only one third of whom are in work. BrightHouse agrees to pay £14.8m for mistreating consumersIs the Queen\u0027s cash helping BrightHouse exploit the poor?Queen invested in rent-to-own firm BrightHouseSimon Read: \u0027Stop the great rent-to-own rip-off\u0027Most RTO customers are living on low incomes of between £12,000 and £18,000, and they are likely to have missed a bill payment in the last six months. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: “Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.Mr Bailey added: “We want to stop consumers having to pay many multiples more than the price of a product on the high street. These changes build on the measures we have already taken across the high-cost credit sector.”Firms like Brighthouse, PerfectHome and Buy as You View will be affected by the proposed price cap. The FCA said its previous work had resulted in redress packages totalling £16m for around 340,000 consumers who used these companies. The bulk of that redress came from BrightHouse, which paid £14.8m to 249,000 customers last year after the regulator said it had not acted as a responsible lender. On Thursday, a Brighthouse spokesperson said: “BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years.

Earlier this month\u0026nbspwe argued\u0026nbsphere in The Independent that the prime minister should be able to build momentum for her deal once agreed. And we are sticking to our guns. What’s more, we think her much-derided draft agreement, should it turn into an actual agreement, might yet defy the odds and be approved by parliament.We originally argued that a deal would change the context of the Brexit debate, that sterling would bounce and that businesses would come out in favour of the relative certainty that it provides. Some of this has already happened – although our point referred to after the European Council rather than the week leading up to it. The CBI’s President John Allan came out in support of the deal, saying it “avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure”.If Theresa May gets her Brexit deal markets will go upMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland, the intransigent stance of the DUP is coming in for scrutiny. Our colleague Colin Harvey has pointed out that their Brexit stance is being questioned by “prominent figures from across the community in Northern Ireland”,\u0026nbspand that businesses and the wider community have cautiously welcomed the protocol on Northern Ireland.The hostile reaction it received in parliament, and the spate of resignations and rash of no confidence letters that followed its unveiling, underlined all too clearly that the parliamentary odds do not appear to favour the PM.Yet there is still time before the vote. We (along with Goldman Sachs) continue to expect a post-summit bounce, and, judging from the last week, we’d expect sections of the pro-Brexit media to come out in favour of the deal.Mrs May seems to have stabilised the cabinet by holding on to the Pizza Club of key pro-Brexit ministers and adding some waverers from both Brexit wings of her party to the government payroll. And she has in fact strengthened over the past week, with polling published in The Times revealing a 13-point increase in support for Theresa May among the public. MPs reluctant to support a prime minister on the verge last week are more likely to come on board as her position gradually improves.Moreover, the prime minister still has some wiggle room. Remember, the Withdrawal Agreement, is a document filled with obligations – to pay money, to provide rights for EU citizens and to avoid an Irish border. There is a slight chance that this might yet be revised to hold out the possibility that both sides can just about conceive of a technical fix that might obviate the need of the contentious backstop ever being needed. That might yet sway some pro-Brexit MPs who fear the chaos that rejection of the deal would unleash.And sugar for the rather bitter pill of the withdrawal agreement might also be provided by the political declaration. Henry Newman has gone through some of the ways in which this might be drafted to maximise political backing. As the clock ticks down, the options will crystallise into real choices. Not this deal versus a hypothetical ideal outcome, but between the deal, no deal or a general election or referendum.Once the package lands in parliament, process, sequencing and timing will matter enormously. Indeed, it might transpire that getting the barrage of criticism over and done with last week was a tactical masterstroke. Whilst opponents of the deal have worn themselves out, the prime minister can come back from Brussels on Sunday and start to build a more durable coalition.Those against Theresa May’s version of Brexit have pretty much had an open field up to now, but the prime minister has begun a highly orchestrated campaign defending her position properly, perhaps for the first time.Moreover, as Labour MP Lisa Nandy has pointed out, the order in which the Commons deals with amendments to the motion on the Withdrawal Agreement will be crucial. Anti-Brexit MPs are ided over whether to put up amendments calling for a referendum first, or to force a defeat of the deal and then put together a pro-referendum coalition.If a pro-referendum amendment is defeated, the ensuing meaningful vote comes to look like a choice between deal and no deal, which might cause more parliamentarians to opt for the former. And, as Raphael Hogarth argues, some Tory Remainers might then be persuaded to support the PM.Meanwhile, the prime minister will continue to try to pile pressure on her party from below. A Survation poll showed a slight plurality of Conservative councillors thought MPs should support the deal, with almost two-thirds saying they would back her personally in a confidence vote. It may be that ramping up constituency pressure on MPs will also help her shift some waverers, though polling by Conservative Home underlines what a mountain she has to climb to persuade her grassroots.After two years of this weak and wobbly prime minister, we’ve surely learned that its rash to write her off.Anand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

African heritage cannot be only in private collections and European museums – it must be showcased in Paris but also in Dakar, Lagos and Cotonou. This will be one of my priorities.”With many of the artworks being “acquired” by foreign entities\u0026nbspin the 19th century, there is not always clear documentation on the transfer, which many see as a simple case of looting.The report will be released on Friday and, according to The New York Times, estimates that 90 to 95 per cent of Africa’s cultural heritage resides outside of the continent.If France takes steps to return African artworks, there will be pressure on museums in other countries to do the same. On Tuesday, the governor of Easter Island was in tears as she begged the British Museum to return one of its main statues – the Hoa Hakananai’a – saying: “You have our soul.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But as\u0026nbspSean O’Grady\u0026nbspexplains, she is following in a long Conservative tradition\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentBattles over the UK\u0027s relationship with the continent have blighted successive Tory premiershipsCould Europe be enough to wreck yet another Tory premiership?As Theresa May faces prospective votes of no confidence,\u0026nbspin her leadership from her own MPs, and in her government from internal dissidents and opposition parties, it may be scant comfort that she would hardly be the first Conservative leader to see their dreams and ambitions destroyed by a subject – Europe – that is seemingly incapable of resolution.Indeed, May, punningly enough, exists as a sort of political mayflower – her\u0026nbsplife in office, be it long or short, devoted to one purpose only: Brexit. All the stuff about “burning injustices”, the high-minded schemes to reinvigorate the British economy with an “industrial strategy” – her own mild brand of corporatism – or the plight of the “just about managing” families has been subsumed by the question of Britain’s EU withdrawal.To use a modern phrase, her administration has not the “bandwidth” to deal with everything else as well as sort out Brexit in truth it doesn’t really have the capacity or the intellectual clout to deal with Brexit itself.\u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit in photos: a portrait of the West MidlandsIn order to break the blackmailing hold of her band of Eurosceptic fundamentalists – and, to be fair, the truculent resistance of the Europhiles – she sought her own mandate at the general election of 2017. In an inexplicably long campaign the British electorate did what they usually do when asked a question by a prime mister – they chose to answer a different one. Called upon to back her with the kind of resounding support that would give her the oomph needed to carry out her Lancaster House hardish Brexit plan, the British electorate instead decided to blow a large raspberry and vote in unthinkable numbers for Jeremy Corbyn.“Nothing has changed,” she foolishly said during yet another campaign cock-up. In reality everything changed when she lost her majority, her moral authority and her political autonomy. Ironically, from that moment on she was the captive of every voluble faction or personality persuaded they could do a better job than she could – and there was no shortage of those. It was quietly said that she wouldn’t lead her party into another general election, even after she had jettisoned her closest aides and handed a veto over her cabinet-making to the 1922 Committee. She indicated that she had got her party and the country into his mess – and would get them out of it. It might have been better all round if they’d just ditched her then but, as usual, her enemies were willing to wound but not to kill. (My apologies if that language seems too violently intemperate for our times)Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exitThe outcome of the British general election of 2017 was, then, not the triumph of May and the Leavers, but the revenge of the Remainers. It has left its mark. Now May is chained to the radiator of the Democratic Unionist Party, whose illogical and inconsistent demands could only be carried out by means of ine intervention.Sad, as they say, but true and hardly unpredictable. We remember\u0026nbspall too well\u0026nbsphow David Cameron almost casually tossed away his place in history – which might otherwise have been relatively distinguished – with a pledge to hold an inout EU referendum. On 23 January 2013 – a day that should live in infamy – at a speech at the Bloomberg HQ in London, Cameron explained his rationale. To be fair, he had some good points to make:“Those who refuse to contemplate consulting the British people would in my view make more likely our eventual exit.“Simply asking the British people to carry on accepting a European settlement over which they have had little choice is a path to ensuring that when the question is finally put – and at some stage it will have to be – it is much more likely that the British people will reject the EU.“That is why I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue – shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.”“First, the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in Europe.Second, there is a crisis of European competitiveness, as other nations across the world soar ahead. And third, there is a gap between the EU and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years, and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in Britain.”By the way, and as if to prove the sure touch, if not genius, for politics possessed by Tony Blair, the reaction of the ex-prime minister at the time to Cameron’s move is chillingly and amusingly prophetic:Travel Question: Will Brexit affect holidays in Spain?In the early 2010s, as the coalition cut its way to dismal poll ratings Cameron was, in truth, spooked by the rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip, capitalising on a widespread but inchoate set of grievances in post-financial crisis, post-austerity, “left-behind” Britain.Cameron feared being outflanked by them on the right, splitting the traditional Conservative vote and losing seats to Ed Miliband’s Labour Party. In a way his strategy succeeded – but too well. At the 2015 election, with the collapse in the Liberal Democrat vote, Labour’s rout in Scotland at the hands of the SNP and some recession in Ukip’s charge, very possibly because of Cameron’s referendum pledge, Cameron and his campaign manager George Osborne succeeded so far as to win an overall majority – the first Tory one since 1992. Instead of another round of coalition, with an even stronger Tory domination, they could steer their own course. Instead of being able to plead that “Nick Clegg won’t let me hold the referendum”, Cameron was forced to do so.Or was he? Back in 2015 and 2016 no one was much bothered. Europe hardly featured in the voters’ list of concerns, although immigration often did. Cameron might have got away with forgetting his promise (as he had before on a “cast-iron” one to hold a plebiscite on the Lisbon Treaty of 2009).In any event, Cameron was complacent and, like many, too mesmerised by the precedent of the 1975 vote, when the people tended to “follow the faces they trusted”, as the arch-Europhile Roy Jenkins remarkeCameron failed to see how times had changed, and how folk were more sceptical about “the establishment”, whipped up by Ukip. Cameron also refused to countenance “blue-on-blue” debates, which allowed Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to parade unchallenged directly by their Tory peers the Treasury’s “Project Fear”, by contrast, seemed implausible to many of the public.You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble. We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there...So Cameron lost. He lost his party and his premiership, and he is now routinely relegated to the bottom of the historical premier premiership table, along with Sir Anthony Eden (Suez) and Neville Chamberlain (Munich), in their own ways also guilty of serious delusions about foreign policy. Maybe the memoir\u0026nbspCameron is composing in his £25,000 “shepherd’s cottage” will succeed in rehabilitating him.Before Cameron there was John Major. Like May today, Major faced a huge series of battles to get a European agreement through parliament: the Maastricht Treaty strengthened European integration, but also contained a series of British “opt-outs”, the most valuable being the right to keep the pound and avoid joining the ill-starred euro.Like May today as well, he had no overall majority for much of his time in parliament and a well-organised group of Eurosceptics tormenting him. Some crucial votes he only won with the support of the 20 or so Liberal Democrats, then led by Paddy Ashdown, prepared to put country before party Labour was uniformly hostile to Major’s legislation, though agreeing with almost everything in it.Eurosceptics (AFPGetty)Major, like May, had a gang of leaky Eurosceptics in cabinet permanently causing trouble. In an unguarded moment in front of a live mic, he let slip his true feelings:“Just think it through from my perspective. You are the prime minister, with a majority of 18, a party that is still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented. You have three right-wing members of the cabinet who actually resign. What happens in the parliamentary party?“I could bring in other people. But where do you think most of this poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. You can think of ex-ministers who are going around causing all sorts of trouble.“We don’t want another three more of the bastards out there. What’s Lyndon Johnson’s maxim?...”May must feel the same way about today’s “gang of five”, the “pizza club” of Leadsom, Gove, Fox, Grayling and Mordaunt. And, indeed, about Michael Howard, Peter Lilley and John Redwood, still banging the same drum as they did in Major’s cabinet a quarter century ago. (At least Michael Portillo has gone off to play with trains and model garishly coloured blazers.)ITVRex)Major survived his own leadership crisis over Europe, one he felt he had to end himself by, shockingly, resigning his position as party leader (but not prime minister) and inviting his enemies to “put up or shut up”. John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, did so and scored respectably, but ultimately lost. So Major carried on, his authority scarcely enhanced before he was slaughtered by Blair in 1997. It was the Tories’ worst thrashing since 1832. As he himself said within weeks, it was time to “leave the stage”.When Major claimed that his foes were “still harking back to a golden age that never was, and is now invented”, it was plainly a reference to the Thatcher premiership – which remains to this day a golden age for the right of the Conservative Party and their fellow travellers in Ukip – the likes of Arron Banks and Farage explicitly declaring their devotion to her.\u0026nbspIn many ways the Leave campaign was a movement that sought to bring back Thatcherism, the EU being regarded as a pettifogging, bureaucratic,\u0026nbspeven socialist\u0026nbspbarrier to the return of free enterprise, low tax\u0026nbspand the small-state policies of the 1980s. It was, if you will, a campaign for Mrs Thatcher’s fourth term in office, the one she never got to deliver.Eurosceptics (KeystoneHulton ArchiveGetty)The allegiance to Thatcher was, however, of the late-vintage Thatcher – the one who, when she reached the Lords, was happy to vote against her own party on Maastricht the one who made the landmark Bruges speech in 1988, a sort of Old Testament for Eurosceptics. A brief extract gives its flavour:“We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain\u0026nbsponly to see them reimposed at a European level with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels.“Certainly we want to see Europe more united and with a greater sense of common purpose.“But it must be in a way which preserves the different traditions, parliamentary powers and sense of national pride in one’s own country for these have been the source of Europe’s vitality through the centuries.”Pure prototype Ukip, you might say. Yet she also declared in that same address, less comfortably for the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Farage:“The lesson of the economic history of Europe in the Seventies and Eighties is that central planning and detailed control\u0026nbspdo not\u0026nbspwork and that personal endeavour and initiative\u0026nbspdo that a state-controlled economy is a recipe for low growth and that free enterprise within a framework of law brings better results.“The aim of a Europe open to enterprise is the moving force behind the creation of the single European market in 1992. By getting rid of barriers, by making it possible for companies to operate on a European scale, we can best compete with the United States, Japan and other new economic powers emerging in Asia and elsewhere.”Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving peacetime premier of the 20th century, left office on 22 November\u0026nbsp1990. She did so for four manifest reasons. First, what was called “style” – an increasingly imperious manner. Second, a deepening economic recession. Third, the poll tax, which was incredibly unpopular and became a direct threat to Tory MPs’ chances of holding on to their seats. But there was also the question of Europe.Created with Sketch.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlines Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice.

At the time the Conservative Party had many more European true believers at its head than today and when the then-leader of the Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned in protest at the prime minister’s dismissive approach to Europe, she was fatally damaged. Her words at prime minister’s questions were the final straw for Howe, Michael Heseltine and the other Europhiles, and they echo down the years:Biggest rise in UK poverty since Thatcher was in power, experts claimThree weeks later she had had to quit, but not until she had had time to refuse\u0026nbspa request from the Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, to hold a general election so the British people could make their own choice about her successor. Plus ça change.The trouble for the Tories over Europe goes further back still. Britain’s first, belated attempt to join the then European Economic Community (EEC) was rejected after a few years of negotiations in 1963 – because of a French veto. After President Charles\u0026nbspde Gaulle said “non” to the UK, the fortunes of the Conservative movement declined markedly.The prime minister responsible\u0026nbspfor the bid, Harold Macmillan, saw it as the great strategic purpose of his administration:\u0026nbspthe way to find a role in the world as the British empire was being dismantled, and a way to boost the UK’s sluggish growth by joining in with the fastest growing economic bloc (apart from Japan) at the time. Macmillan, in the end, failed and his government was defeated by\u0026nbspLabour in 1964.In fact the only Tory leader to remotely prosper from Europe was Ted Heath, who was Macmillan’s chief negotiator – the reverse of a Brexit secretary – and went on to be the Tory PM who took the UK in to the EEC in 1973.Even there, though, the effort left some bad feelings among the small band of Tory proto-Eurosepctics, led by Enoch Powell, a man in love with parliament and fixated by sovereignty. More concerned with immigration, his hatred of the EEC was visceral, and his advice to Tory voters in marginal seats in the West Midlands in the 1974 election to vote Labour – because they\u0026nbsp were offering a referendum on staying in the EEC – was pivotal in pushing Heath out of No 10. So, in his way, even Heath was a victim of his party’s troubled and ambiguous relationship to the European issue.So there they are then: Macmillan, Heath, Thatcher, Cameron, May. Europe has haunted the Tories for almost seven decades, ever since Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan politely said “no” to an invitation to join attempts to create a European Community in the 1950s.Wrangling about Europe also badly distracted the Tories in opposition under William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. The floor is littered with other political corpses and zombie policies (remember Hague’s “Save the Pound”?). Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine never became leader of their party because they were too pro-European. Others, such as Johnson and Gove, have\u0026nbspfound their anti-European crusading not quite sufficient to carry them into No 10, mainly because most of the parliamentary party remained relatively relaxed about the EU – epitomised by, say, Amber Rudd and\u0026nbspPhilip Hammond, as well as Cameron and Osborne.Further back in the mists of history, all the way back to the mid-19th century, we find the Conservatives split about protectionism and “imperial preference” as against global free trade. The issue came back time and again to mither Tory statesmen from Robert Peel to Stanley Baldwin. Only the Second World War forced them to take their minds off trade policy.The last Tory leader to talk much sense about Europe was in fact the Mark I David Cameron, the one who in 2006 told his party simply to “stop banging on about Europe”.Whatever happened to that idea?Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The Financial Conduct Authority said some customers are paying as much as four times the average retail price for essential household goods like washing machines or cookers, due to extra charges such as add-on insurance and warranties imposed by RTO firms.According to the FCA, customers who use these companies are “some of the most financially vulnerable in our society”, only one third of whom are in work. BrightHouse agrees to pay £14.8m for mistreating consumersIs the Queen\u0027s cash helping BrightHouse exploit the poor?Queen invested in rent-to-own firm BrightHouseSimon Read: \u0027Stop the great rent-to-own rip-off\u0027Most RTO customers are living on low incomes of between £12,000 and £18,000, and they are likely to have missed a bill payment in the last six months. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA, said: “Today’s measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices. If implemented it will save consumers up to £22.7m a year from excessive charges.Mr Bailey added: “We want to stop consumers having to pay many multiples more than the price of a product on the high street. These changes build on the measures we have already taken across the high-cost credit sector.”Firms like Brighthouse, PerfectHome and Buy as You View will be affected by the proposed price cap. The FCA said its previous work had resulted in redress packages totalling £16m for around 340,000 consumers who used these companies. The bulk of that redress came from BrightHouse, which paid £14.8m to 249,000 customers last year after the regulator said it had not acted as a responsible lender. On Thursday, a Brighthouse spokesperson said: “BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers.“We’re going to carefully consider today’s announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need.”In 2017, the Queen was revealed to be a small investor in BrightHouse. Information from the leaked Paradise Papers showed Her Majesty had a £10m holding in the firm through the Duchy of Lancaster.

Earlier this month\u0026nbspwe argued\u0026nbsphere in The Independent that the prime minister should be able to build momentum for her deal once agreed. And we are sticking to our guns. What’s more, we think her much-derided draft agreement, should it turn into an actual agreement, might yet defy the odds and be approved by parliament.We originally argued that a deal would change the context of the Brexit debate, that sterling would bounce and that businesses would come out in favour of the relative certainty that it provides. Some of this has already happened – although our point referred to after the European Council rather than the week leading up to it. The CBI’s President John Allan came out in support of the deal, saying it “avoids the wrecking ball that would be a no-deal departure”.If Theresa May gets her Brexit deal markets will go upMeanwhile, in Northern Ireland, the intransigent stance of the DUP is coming in for scrutiny. Our colleague Colin Harvey has pointed out that their Brexit stance is being questioned by “prominent figures from across the community in Northern Ireland”,\u0026nbspand that businesses and the wider community have cautiously welcomed the protocol on Northern Ireland.The hostile reaction it received in parliament, and the spate of resignations and rash of no confidence letters that followed its unveiling, underlined all too clearly that the parliamentary odds do not appear to favour the PM.Yet there is still time before the vote. We (along with Goldman Sachs) continue to expect a post-summit bounce, and, judging from the last week, we’d expect sections of the pro-Brexit media to come out in favour of the deal.Mrs May seems to have stabilised the cabinet by holding on to the Pizza Club of key pro-Brexit ministers and adding some waverers from both Brexit wings of her party to the government payroll. And she has in fact strengthened over the past week, with polling published in The Times revealing a 13-point increase in support for Theresa May among the public. MPs reluctant to support a prime minister on the verge last week are more likely to come on board as her position gradually improves.Moreover, the prime minister still has some wiggle room. Remember, the Withdrawal Agreement, is a document filled with obligations – to pay money, to provide rights for EU citizens and to avoid an Irish border. There is a slight chance that this might yet be revised to hold out the possibility that both sides can just about conceive of a technical fix that might obviate the need of the contentious backstop ever being needed. That might yet sway some pro-Brexit MPs who fear the chaos that rejection of the deal would unleash.And sugar for the rather bitter pill of the withdrawal agreement might also be provided by the political declaration. Henry Newman has gone through some of the ways in which this might be drafted to maximise political backing. As the clock ticks down, the options will crystallise into real choices. Not this deal versus a hypothetical ideal outcome, but between the deal, no deal or a general election or referendum.Once the package lands in parliament, process, sequencing and timing will matter enormously. Indeed, it might transpire that getting the barrage of criticism over and done with last week was a tactical masterstroke. Whilst opponents of the deal have worn themselves out, the prime minister can come back from Brussels on Sunday and start to build a more durable coalition.Those against Theresa May’s version of Brexit have pretty much had an open field up to now, but the prime minister has begun a highly orchestrated campaign defending her position properly, perhaps for the first time.Moreover, as Labour MP Lisa Nandy has pointed out, the order in which the Commons deals with amendments to the motion on the Withdrawal Agreement will be crucial. Anti-Brexit MPs are ided over whether to put up amendments calling for a referendum first, or to force a defeat of the deal and then put together a pro-referendum coalition.If a pro-referendum amendment is defeated, the ensuing meaningful vote comes to look like a choice between deal and no deal, which might cause more parliamentarians to opt for the former. And, as Raphael Hogarth argues, some Tory Remainers might then be persuaded to support the PM.Meanwhile, the prime minister will continue to try to pile pressure on her party from below. A Survation poll showed a slight plurality of Conservative councillors thought MPs should support the deal, with almost two-thirds saying they would back her personally in a confidence vote. It may be that ramping up constituency pressure on MPs will also help her shift some waverers, though polling by Conservative Home underlines what a mountain she has to climb to persuade her grassroots.After two years of this weak and wobbly prime minister, we’ve surely learned that its rash to write her off.Anand Menon is director and Matt Bevington a policy researcher at\u0026nbspThe UK in a Changing Europe\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

For years, the US has been unable to launch its own astronauts to the space station or anywhere else – instead relying on Russia to do so for them – and has been waiting and hoping for private solutions to the problem.The historic launch will take place on 7 January, 2019, Nasa said.Nasa video says it is going back to the Moon –\u0026nbspand staying thereThis will be the first uncrewed test flight of the Commercial Crew Program and will provide data on the performance of the Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as on-orbit, docking and landing operations, it said in an announcement.The flight test also will provide valuable data toward NASA certifying SpaceX’s crew transportation system for carrying astronauts to and from the space station.No astronaut has been launched into space since 2011, when the Space Shuttle programme was retired. Since then, all launches have happened at the Baikonur\u0026nbspCosmodrome, which is run by Russia – a situation that has occasionally caused problems, such as fears that no missions would be able to launch after a major issue with a recent trip to the International Space Station.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The first half talks about the “inisibility of the four freedoms” – namely goods, services, capital and labour.\u0026nbspWhat the document says: It must also ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market, while respecting the result of the 2016 referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the United Kingdom.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe next sentence of the same paragraph puts up in lights that “free movement of people” will end. In the previous version, this was buried so deep some experts missed it. But if the freedoms are inisible, that means the UK cannot have free movement of goods, services and capital. That contradiction is not solved by the rest of the document.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe economic partnership should ensure no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors, with ambitious customs arrangements that, in line with the Parties\u0027 objectives and principles above, build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe sentence in the first draft that caused Dominic Raab to resign as Brexit secretary is still in there, about building on the single customs territory, only now it has “and improve” in as well, as if that makes it better from the point of view of someone who doesn’t want a single customs territory (fudgespeak for a customs union).\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe Parties envisage that the extent of the United Kingdom’s commitments on customs and regulatory cooperation, including with regard to alignment of rules, would be taken into account in the application of related checks and controls, considering this as a factor in reducing risk.\u0026nbspWhat it really means:\u0026nbspThis paragraph referring to “checks and controls” cleverly leaves out “at the border” from last week’s version. This is an important win for Theresa May, in allowing future regulatory checks to be carried out at the point of despatch or arrival.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspNoting that the United Kingdom has decided that the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply, the Parties should establish mobility arrangements, as set out below.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe section on mobility now starts by asserting that “free movement of persons” will come to an end. Someone has joked that “freedom of movement” is being replaced by “liberty of mobility”, but that is not (yet) fair.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspThe Parties agree to consider conditions for entry and stay for purposes such as research, study, training and youth exchanges.What it really means:\u0026nbspSpecifying the possible purposes for which EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU might “stay” is new.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspWithin the context of the overall economic partnership the Parties should establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter alia, access to waters and quota shares.What it really means:\u0026nbspScottish Conservative MPs warned the prime minister that they could not accept fishing quota shares being included in the future trade deal. But they have been. More trouble ahead.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspBoth Parties affirm that the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process in Northern Ireland will remain of paramount importance to peace, stability and reconciliation. They agree that the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement reached on 10 April 1998 by the United Kingdom Government, the Irish Government and the other participants in the multi-party negotiations must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 Agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 Agreement.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe explicit reference to the Good FridayBelfast Agreement has been added, and the phrase “must be protected in all its parts”. But this won’t be enough to reassure the DUP or Conservatives worried about Northern Ireland being kept in parts of the EU single market when the rest of the UK is not.\u0026nbspWhat the document says:\u0026nbspIn setting out the framework of the future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom, this declaration confirms, as set out in the Withdrawal Agreement, that it is the clear intent of both Parties to develop in good faith agreements giving effect to this relationship and to begin the formal process of negotiations as soon as possible after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, such that they can come into force by the end of 2020.What it really means:\u0026nbspThe section on the timetable for negotiating the full trade treaty has been expanded, but with little actual substance. Instead of “using best endeavours to ensure” the treaty can take effect by the end of 2020, it now speaks of the “intent … to develop in good faith”. Which sounds a bit weaker to me, but I’m not an international trade negotiator.\u0026nbspAs\u0026nbspNick Macpherson, the former permanent secretary to the Treasury, commented: “With no legal status a political declaration can be all things to all people.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She said the UK and EU negotiating teams had worked through the night to finalise\u0026nbspthe text.It comes after Ms May held talks with\u0026nbspJean-Claude\u0026nbspJuncker, president of the European Commission, in Brussels on Wednesday. She will return to the Belgian capital on Sunday for a summit at which EU member states will decide whether or not to approve the proposed withdrawal agreement.UK and EU agree\u0026nbspwording of declaration on future relationshipTheresa May insists deal is \u0027right\u0027 for UK and \u0027sets us on course for a brighter future\u0027Matt Hancock admits fresh Brexit referendum possible if May\u0027s deal voted downKey Commons committee urges government to delay votes on Universal CreditBrexiteer MPs have kicked off about Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitical agreement, branding it a betrayal of the vote.Tory MP Sheryll Murray said: In the EU referendum people voted to taken back control of our fish.Yet now the Prime Minister wants to commit us to stay in the Common Fisheries Policy in all but name. She seeks to enter a new fisheries agreement on access to waters and quota shares.“Let’s be clear. This is a betrayal of Brexit.”Former cabinet minister Priti Patel said:\u0026nbsp“Everything the EU wanted from the negotiations has ended up in the Withdrawal Agreement – which is a legally enforceable international treaty.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“That’s why we’re going to stay in the EU customs union, remain subject to judgments of the European Court, imperil our Union and allow the EU to have a veto over when we can leave the backstop.“Everything the UK wanted has been put in an unenforceable, meaningless declaration.\u0026nbspAnd it’s cost us £39bn.“This is a costly surrender by the UK government.”Here\u0027s the full text of Theresa May\u0027s statement on the steps of Downing Street:Throughout these difficult and complex negotiations with the European Union, I have had one goal in mind to honour the vote of the British people and to deliver a good Brexit deal.Last week we achieved a decisive breakthrough when we agreed with the European Commission the terms for our smooth and orderly exit from the EU.Alongside that withdrawal agreement we published an outline political declaration setting out the framework for our future relationship.Last night I had a good, detailed discussion with president Juncker in which I set out what was needed in the declaration to deliver for the United Kingdom.We tasked our negotiating teams to continue working overnight, and as a result the text of that declaration has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom.I have just updated the Cabinet on progress and I\u0027ll be making a statement to the House of Commons later this afternoon.This is the right deal for the UK. It delivers on the vote of the referendum, it brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws and it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.The agreement we have reached is between the UK and the European Commission.It is now up to the 27 leaders of the EU member states to examine this agreement in the days leading up to the special EU Council meeting on Sunday.I will be speaking to my counterparts over that time including speaking to Chancellor Kurz of Austria here in Downing Street later today.Last night I spoke to the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and I\u0027m confident on Sunday that we\u0027ll be able to agree a deal that delivers for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.On Saturday I will return to Brussels for a further meeting with President Juncker where we will discuss how to bring this process to a conclusion in the interest of all our people.The British people want this to be settled, they want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future.That deal is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver on it.Prominent Brexiteer\u0026nbspMark Francois\u0026nbsphas said the political declaration will do little to help Theresa May get her Brexit deal through Parliament.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe told Radio 4\u0027s The World At One:This is not binding under any international law. It is 26 pages of political camouflage designed to take people\u0027s eye off the withdrawal agreement and try and persuade them to vote it through. It will not work.The legally binding element in this is the withdrawal agreement. That is what MPs will vote on in the meaningful vote. This is a fig leaf.Even with this, which won\u0027t fool anybody, they will never get the withdrawal agreement through the House of Commons.Theresa May is unexpectedly speaking in Downing Street.\u0026nbspShe says she had a good, detailed discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels last night.\u0026nbspThe negotiating teams continued working through the night to agree the political declaration\u0026nbspand as a result the text of that declaration has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMay says she has updated the Cabinet and will deliver a statement in the Commons this afternoon.\u0026nbspShe says the EU27 must now decide whether to support the agreement when the European Council meets on Sunday. She\u0026nbsp will be lobbying\u0026nbspleaders\u0026nbspbefore then and says she is confident that the deal will be signed off.\u0026nbspThe prime minister\u0026nbspwill hold further talks with Juncker on Saturday, she adds.\u0026nbspShe says a deal that sets us on course for a brighter future is within our grasp and that she is determined to deliver it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspReports suggest Theresa May\u0027s statement in the Commons will now take place at 3pm, not 2.30pm as previously suggested. We\u0027re still waiting for official confirmation that it\u0027s happening at all.Further evidence for a\u0026nbspCommons statement by Theresa May this afternoon\u0026nbspcomes from the news that Jeremy Corbyn has cancelled a planned trip\u0026nbspto Wales, where he was due to visit a dairy.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader is believed to be on his way back to London to respond to the prime minister\u0027s update. He was due to be meeting workers at the\u0026nbspFirst Milk dairy in Haverfordwest in west Wales\u0026nbspon Thursday afternoon.\u0026nbspThe Cabinet is currently being briefed by telephone on the political declaration agreed between the UK and EU.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexiteers will be listening closely to determine whether it includes any of the elements they were urging No 10 to secure from the EU.\u0026nbspDowning Street has refused to confirm that Theresa May will update the Commons later today, but we understand a statement is likely at 2.30pm.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has admitted a fresh Brexit referendum is a possibility.While saying he was\u0026nbsp“dead set against” he admitted it was impossible to rule out if Ms May\u0027s deal is rejected by MPs.\u0026nbspHe told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain:\u0026nbsp“If it doesn’t go through, whether we end up with no deal or second referendum is impossible to know. I think that everybody should vote for the deal because it is in the national interest.Asked to rule out the possibility of a second referendum, he said:“I’m certainly ruling out me supporting it.”“I think a second referendum would be terrible. It would be incredibly isive. Think of how isive the debate about Brexit\u0026nbsphas been over the last few years.

A separate document outlining what the future trading relationship between Britain\u0026nbspand the EU will look like was however still being worked on.It is understood that this latest leaked draft\u0026nbsphas been approved by the European Commission, but still requires the 27 EU member states to sign off on it. Countries including France, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands have already raised concerns that earlier drafts of the\u0026nbspplan gives too much away to the UK.The new agreement reached between the Commission and UK says the deal\u0026nbspwould have “implications for checks and controls” on trade between the UK and EU, which currently do not exist. It spells out that the extent and nature of these impediments to trade\u0026nbspwill vary depending on the extent to which Britain aligns\u0026nbspits regulations and customs with the EU.\u0026nbspBrexit trade deal \u0027not finished\u0027 and could still change, Barnier warnsMichel Barnier urges MPs to take ‘responsibility’ and back Brexit dealThere is now ‘a Nigel Farage’ in every EU country, Michel Barnier says“The parties envisage that the extent of the United Kingdom’s commitments on customs and regulatory cooperation, including with regard to alignment of rules, would be taken into account in the application of related checks and controls, considering this as a factor in reducing risk,” the leaked final draft says.“This, combined with the use of all available facilitative arrangements as described above, can lead to a spectrum of different outcomes for administrative processes as well as checks and controls, and note in this context their wish to be as ambitious as possible, while respecting the integrity of their respective markets and legal orders.”The PM has ruled out membership of the EU single market or customs union, which Brussels\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said are required for frictionless trade. The prime minister’s so-called “Chequers” plan aimed to avoid border checks between Britain and the EU with a series of proposals, but was rejected as unworkable by the EU.\u0026nbspNods to the defunct\u0026nbspUK plan included in the draft include a reference to using facilitative arrangements and technologies to try and avoid customs bureaucracy.It also promises that the countries will consider trusted traders’ programmes, administrative cooperation in customs matters and mutual assistance, including for the recovery of claims related to taxes and duties – another Tory eurosceptic demand aimed at avoiding border\u0026nbspchecks. But there are no firm commitments to actually implementing the ideas.The document also speaks in vague terms about the parties’ “determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern Ireland” with “alternative\u0026nbsp arrangements\u0026nbsp for\u0026nbsp ensuring\u0026nbsp the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland”.\u0026nbspTory MPs\u0026nbspand the DUP\u0026nbspdislike the backstop, which they say could bind the UK into a customs union with the EU on an indefinite basis,\u0026nbspand will put a border down the Irish sea.\u0026nbspBut with the same document also saying checks and controls are expected in any future relationship, the clause to remove the backstop\u0026nbspcarries little actual weight.Elsewhere in the plan, the EU and UK pledge to\u0026nbspbuild and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin – a suggestion that a customs union with the UK could become permanent, which has angered Tory MPs.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchThe overall agreement is vague – neither committing to closing down most options not taking them forward.The prime minister is understood to have briefed Cabinet on the document at lunchtime on Thursday.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said: “I have just sent to EU27 a draft Political Declaration on the Future Relationship between EU and UK. The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the leaders.”If the EU27 leaders agree to the document they will meet with Theresa May in Brussels on Sunday to formally sign off the deal. The Prime Minister is expected to return to the EU capital on Saturday in a last-minute bid to smooth the deal\u0027s acceptance.\u0026nbspIf approved, it\u0026nbspwill then be put to the European Parliament and the UK Parliament for their approval, with its passage through the latter looking difficult.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The plan stated: “We will improve the credit blacklist system, publicly disclose the records of enterprises and iniduals\u0027 untrustworthiness on a regular basis, and form a pattern of distrust and punishment.Car ploughs into crowd outside primary school in China, killing fiveTrump aide says China could be evicted from WTO as trade war ramps upGovernment spending foreign aid money to promote fracking in ChinaFor those deemed untrustworthy, “everywhere is limited, and it is difficult to move, so that those who violate the law and lose the trust will pay a heavy price”.The credit system is already being rolled out in some areas and in recent months the Chinese state has blocked millions of people from booking flights and high speed trains.According to the state-run news outlet Global Times, as of May this year, the government had\u0026nbspblocked 11.14 million people from flights and 4.25 million from taking high-speed train trips.The state has also begun to clamp down on luxury options:\u0026nbspthree million people are barred from getting business class train tickets, according to Channel News Asia.China tell ambassadors not to \u0027interfere\u0027 on Muslim re-education campsThe aim, according to Hou Yunchun, former deputy director of the development research centre of the State Council, is to make “discredited people become bankrupt”, he said earlier this year. The eastern state of Hangzou, southwest of Shanghai, is one area where a social credit system is already in place. People are awarded credit points for activities such as undertaking volunteer work and giving blood donations while those who violate traffic laws and charge “under-the-table” fees are punished. Other infractions reportedly include\u0026nbspsmoking in non-smoking zones, buying too many video games and posting fake news online.Punishments are not clearly detailed in the government plan, but beyond making travel difficult, are also believed to include slowing internet speeds, reducing access to good schools for iniduals or their children, banning people from certain jobs, preventing booking at certain hotels and losing the right to own pets.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lebanese army soldiers march during a parade to mark the 75th anniversary of Lebanon\u0027s Independence Day, in Beirut, commemorating the liberation from the French Mandate on 22 November 1943Indian Muslim devotees wave flags as they parade atop vehicles along a street during Eid-Milad-Un-Nabi celebrations in Varanasi in the Indian state of Uttar PradeshAt least 50 people were killed and dozens more injured when a suicide bomber targeted a group of Muslim religious scholars in Kabul, officials in Afghanistan say.A view of the Fuego volcano eruption at sunrise, seen from El Rodeo, Escuintla, Guatemala.

In his book \u0026ldquoThe War Conspiracy: JFK, 911 and the Deep Politics of War he describes \u0026ldquodeep politics as \u0026ldquosustained patterns of collusion underlying major events.                JFK assassination plot REVEALED: \u0026lsquoShock plan by secret Skull and Bo...They are not necessarily the plans of one conspiring group, but subtly shaped by the will of people in power over time, he adds.Scott makes several key claims about the factors that link the two shocking events.\u0026nbspFirstly, he notes that for both\u0026nbspmoments,\u0026nbspkey senior members of government were out of the country.He also draws attention to insider purchases in the stock markets\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash for Scott,\u0026nbspthis suggests \u0026ldquospecial knowledge of what was to come.Was JFK\u0027s assassination similar to 911? (Image: )JFK was elected US President in 1960 (Image: )Similarities also centre around the identities\u0026nbspof the culprits behind\u0026nbspboth crimes.The suspected shooter of JFK, Lee Harvey Oswald, was quickly identified, but using old information on file that did not match what Oswald actually looked like at the time.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspFor Scott this could indicate that Oswald was not picked up from\u0026nbsp eye-witness accounts, but pre-selected as the \u0026ldquodesignated culprit.Similarly, a list of hijackers was issued on 911, four minutes before Flight United 93 came down in Pennsylvania.According to Scott, investigators did this \u0026ldquodrawing on pre-911\u0026nbspfiles,\u0026nbspshowing that intelligence agencies \u0026ldquoknew what was coming.In 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald emerged as a \u0026ldquolone deranged gunman who acted alone, a fact that some still question.\u0026nbspScott points to events that directly preceded the 2001 attacks, when the US government used the same language around a terrorist incident directly linked to the 911 hijackers, despite clear evidence to the contrary.\u0026nbspIn 1990, El Sayyid Nosair, who was trained by 911 hijacker Ali Mohamed, was pronounced to be\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoderanged gunman who \u0026ldquoacted alone by police in the murder of Meir Kahane, the founder of the Jewish Defence League.This was despite training manuals, bomb-making equipment and other evidence that \u0026ldquocould have been used to convict Mohamed, says Scott.911 was one of the most horrific terror attacks in history (Image: )For Scott, this suggests that the lone-gunman narrative is a tool used by the US \u0026ldquoto protect someone or something else.He also says that prior investigations into the eventual culprits of both acts was\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoimpeded.Oswald \u0026ldquowas inexplicably taken off the FBI\u0026rsquos watch list in 1963, when he should have been a candidate for increased\u0026nbspsurveillance,\u0026nbspaccording to Scott.In contrast, the \u0026ldquoCIA failed to tell the FBI for months when two of the 91 terrorist arrived in the US in 2000, in a pattern of \u0026ldquowithholding information.One of the most commented-on factors in both events are the major wars that followed.Lyndon Johnson replaced JFK in the White House after his tragic death (Image: )After JFK\u0026rsquos death, American military involvement in Asia was upped, leading to the Vietnam war.Similarly, the\u0026nbspinvasion of Afghanistan and Iraq was spearheaded by the US very shortly after 911.Scott sees them both as \u0026ldquogateways to already intended wars.The intended outcome, he says, is to engineer a state of \u0026ldquopermanent war - and a state of perpetual warfare\u0026nbsp gives a \u0026ldquopermanent justification for curtailing liberties.

Kick ball, change and turn. Can you do that ”“I’m not allowed.”Not even the kick balls bit Shame. He needs someone to calm him down.Although, as horrendous as it must be to live with, I don’t mind Barrowman on I’m A Celeb, as the show does need a massive irritant to get under everyone’s skin.On similar grounds, I also welcome EastEnders’ Rita Simons, who looks like she might have a tantrum or two in her, Nick Knowles, who will be incapable of stling his Sir Galahad complex, and Harry Redknapp, just because he’s Harry Redknapp.Of the others The public jury’s probably still out on Emily Atack and The Chase Governess Anne Hegerty, who “used to be a Brownie”, as well as eating a lot of them.Mentally, though, I have already completely written off Coronation Street’s Sair Khan, some bloke off Hollyoaks, The Vamps’ James McVey and X Factor’s Fleur East, who arrived dressed as a dispatch rider for the first episode.Possibly for the very good reason she’s now working as one.This might sound like a hasty and fairly damning assessment, I realise, but compared to some series, four solidly promising bookings isn’t actually a bad .What it very clearly needs, though, is Edmonds, because, without him, Sunday’s opening episode, for all its high adrenaline thrills, became a bit of a drag.It usually does, of course, as the celebs haven’t yet let their guard drop.But, in this instance it meant the spotlight fell on Holly Willoughby, and you quickly realised Dec hasn’t had to work this hard since he tried bouncing jokes off Hogan the Koala.Just as Edmonds could turn out to be a massive disappointment, Holly Willoughby could get the hang of I’m A Celeb, obviously.At the moment, though, her one signicant contribution came after the parachuting challenge when she asked: “How come Shane had a helmet and Emily didn’t ”’Cos the bloke was doing all the hard work and she was just hanging around.Buckle up, Dec.Alastair Campbell’s far-too-frequent Good Morning Britain appearances always proving as welcome as a turd in a swimming pool.Strictly stars forever banging on about reaching Blackpool without ever mentioning it means they get paid more.Every wretched, product-placing second of the entertainment on Friday’s Children In Need.And particularly EastEnders’ big song-and-dance routine, which had the Disney Company’s Angela Affinita claiming: “We have Letitia Dean actually interacting with Mickey Mouse.”Good luck with that one, Mickey.IF you want to know just how brutally British republicans would mistreat the Royal Family,they ever came to power, just take a look at what those who claim to love them the most do to the Windsors now.Stuff like We Are Most Amused And Amazed, a th birthday tribute, hosted by Armstrong  Miller, on ITV, that probably left the future King Charles III thinking Charles I got off lightly.Two hours of canned laughter and pick-a-card-any-card magical tw*ttery with the likes of Sandi Toksvig, who took  seconds to remind us she’s gay, Omid Djalili, who took an entire  seconds to remind us he’s Iranian, and Rowan Atkinson, who rather set the evening’s tone by announcing: “As the more perceptive of you will have noticed, this is hell.”There was a family of German illusionists as well, which I thought was a bit insensitive, given the royal circumstances, plus Sooty  Sweep and a lot of grovelling from randoms, like Cheryl Tweedy and Kylie Minogue.Presumably because they could both be guaranteed to keep a straight face when describing the birthday boy as “a style icon” and “philanthropist”.Then, at the end of it all, dear old Charles shuffled on, waved and thanked everybody.And he may even have meant every syllable of it as well, given that Alexander Armstrong thrilled the Palladium crowd by deciding not to sing.Truly, the Royal Family is the most wondrous thing.Jenny Eclair: “The last thing any woman needs, during or after the menopause, is a bothersome vagina.”Tough, you’ve got one for another  minutes.MEANWHILE, desperate times call for desperate means at the rugby, as England trail Japan - and Sir Clive Woodward suggests: “We’ve got to start using our physicality, just outside the rucks, to suck these Japanese guys.”A WELCOME antidote to all of the lazy, repetitive, biased, hideously self-satisfied and right-on comedy broadcast by the BBC and Channel  finally reappeared, on Saturday night.Michael McIntyre’s Big Show, on BBC, which has to be the most perfectly judged hour of television, all year.A quota-free joy that’s warm, funny and has mainstream appeal, without ever being too cloying, safe, predictable or slick, as you will have noticed when Lionel Blair completely sabotaged the “Unexpected Star” reveal, in a pop-up Zimmer frame shop, with -year-old David Owen.“Say hello to David,” McIntyre whispered into his ear-piece.“Hello David!”Pause. “How does he know my name’s David ”Well, quite. Among his other gts, though, Michael McIntyre, above, has the ability to charm and ad-lib his way out of these situations, which gives his Big Show a seat-of-its-pants feel, despite being one of the most carefully structured formats on television.As anyone with a brain can see, in fact, it should be the blueprint for almost everything BBC comedy does.So I can pretty much guarantee, this time next year, Have I Got News, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order will still be telling us how much they hate Brexit and Donald Trump and someone from the BBC, on £, a year, will be assuring licence-payers: “Sara Pascoe is the future of comedy.”Pointless Celebrities: “Hi, I’m Luisa Omielan and I’m a comedian.” Bless.And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I don’t think the word ambition applies to me. I don’t have any ambition.”WHO said the following on live TV, last week “The colon has been mobilised and we’re very close to the moment the bowel’s coming out.”A Nicky Campbell on Channel ’s Removing The Tumour B Theresa May in Downing Street Joe Lycett: “Measuring the strength of earth-quakes, the Richter scale was invented by Charles who ”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Between Newcastle and Gateshead, the King Edward Bridge spans what river ”And Joe Lycett: “Nicola Sturgeon, a Scot or a fish ”Kristy: “A fish.”MICHAEL McIntyre’s Big Show.

After all, the notion that Merkel, Macron et al will bite off their own electorate’s noses to spite Britain’s volte face on EU membership is an absolute nonsense.In a letter to The Times yesterday, the chairman of pub chain JD Wetherspoon, Tim Martin, wrote: “The great urban myth, promoted by advocates of the deadly exchange rate mechanism, the euro and Remain, is that a ‘deal’ with the EU is a prerequisite of future prosperity.”The reality, he says, is that no deal would allow us to join successful countries such as Canada, Singapore, Israel and Australia in the free-trading world and “by slashing the EU’s , protectionist tarfs, shop prices will fall, with no loss to the Treasury, since tarf income is currently remitted to Brussels”.On top of that, we won’t have to pay the £billion orce bill, will regain control of our fishing waters, borders and laws and, ultimately, all have more money in our pockets.

Or, in John Sergeant and Ann Widdecombe’s case, common moths in freefall after a battering from a tea towel.But former Pussycat Doll Ashley is used to performing complicated dance routines in front of huge crowds and, therefore, oozed confidence and expertise from the get go.Little wonder since, according to her former dance teacher in the US, she was taught “all dferent styles of dance” from the age of eight to  and once had an introduction to ballroom training by an elite dance company at summer school.So yes, she’s undoubtedly the best, with former Steps trouper Faye Tozer not far behind. But the true Strictly stars are all the others who improve each week despite being way outside their comfort zone.FOLLOWING the shocking attack of a female PC being karate-kicked to the ground by a thug, the flippant commentary accompanying the footage is indeed sickening.But at least the film might help secure a prosecution and hopefully prove a turning point in how we take back control of our lawless streets.Because the real problem here is the fact that thugs clearly don’t fear the consequences of their actions.So may I humbly suggest that it’s high time the Home Office toughens up and shows, not tells, our hard-pressed police that they now have the power and support they need from on high to do their job effectively.CHECK out poo guru Gillian McKeith out on the town with her smiling -year-old daughter Skylar.Considering my daughters won’t be seen dead with meI wear anything more risqué than a baggy polo neck and tweed maxi skirt, she’s very fortunate indeed.THE £.

In , we expect our national broadcaster to reflect all our opinions even-handedly.We don’t want the BBC to tell us that one side is right and the other wrong, or what we should believe, or which opinions are “true” and which are “”.But that is what the BBC has started to do, at least on the subject of Brexit.The BBC tried to be reasonably balanced during the referendum campaign, but it was so upset by the outcome that it has abandoned any attempt at impartiality and become grotesquely one-sided.The views of Remainers are not just over-represented, they are rarely challenged. And scare stories about Brexit which are either exaggerated or completely imaginary are presented as fact.I decided to compile a list of myths about Brexit — particularly scare stories about what will happen when we leave the Customs Union orwe leave Europe without a deal.Then I compared them with the facts. Although the pamphlet did not mention the BBC, most of the myths were things we hear daily on its programmes.The BBC rose to the bait and invited me into the Today programme on Radio  yesterday to be grilled by John Humphrys, its star interviewer. It was a fair enough interview. He challenged my arguments but I was able to refute his claims point by point.However, they then brought on a chap called Chris Morris, described as the BBC “reality checker”, who was invited to rebut my document. But all he did was oppose my facts with the opinions of people with whom he agreed.He systematically argued the Remain case and defended their Project Fear scare stories. The one thing he did not do was bring in any new facts. My central claim was thatwe leave the EU Customs Union but have a free trade agreement with the European Union, our businesses have little to fear.The main dference will be that traders will have to send in a customs declaration detailing the goods they are buying from or selling to Europe.That is a nuisance which we should try to simply as much as possible.But allegations that “this will be hugely costly, cause y delays, disrupt supply chains and undermine economic growth” are imaginary or exaggerated.“Fact checker” Morris said the majority of trade experts and freight companies to whom he had spoken robustly disagreed with me. This is an opinion, not a fact.Surely,trading in a free trade area — like that which exists between Switzerland and the EU or between Canada and the US — is so intolerable, the people there would be calling for a customs union.But they aren’t. I prefer their practical experience to the speculation of Mr Morris’s contacts.I also quoted a report by the CLECAT organisation, which covers , companies handling  per cent of the freight and customs in Europe, who said: “All the ingredients to ensure a smooth exit process of the UK from the EU, and which allow almost frictionless trade after the exit, are already available.”Why should a BBC fact checker’s unnamed contacts count for more than their considered view He then claimed there are no checks at the border at present. I go across to my house in France frequently and see the checks — for drugs, illegal immigrants, alcohol, cigarettes.And companies have to report all their cross-border trade separately on their VAT s and provide statistical s to Brussels.Then Mr Morris claimed there would be more checks by our customs officers at Dover, resulting in delays and disruption. That is nonsense.The Head of Customs and Revenue has said it only stops and searches lorries at present where it has intelligence information about drugs, illegal immigrants, and goods such as tobacco and alcohol, upon which excise duty is paid.It does not expect any of these risks to become more frequent. So it will not need to search any more vehicles.As I was still in the studio, I was able to rebut his pathetic attempts to rebut my facts. Normally he gets a clear run.But what is intolerable is that he almost never tries to rebut arguments by those trying to overturn the referendum result.I asked him afterwards to name a single Remainer whose case he had attempted to dissect. When he replied that there were “lots”, I said it should be easy to name one and, after repeated challenges, he named Jeremy Corbyn.The idea that Mr Corbyn — a man who has voted more often against European membership than any other MP and went on holiday during the referendum — is a Remainer could only be taken for reality by a BBC reality checker.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There isn’t a majority for that to take place”.A second Cabinet minister, Treasury chief secretary Liz Truss went on to insist the only choice is actually between the PM’s deal and no Brexit at all.Dubbing the moment as “a historic opportunity to leave the EU”, Ms Truss argued: “If my colleagues don’t sign up to this in Parliament, we’re in grave danger of not leaving at all”.But the PM stuck to her long-running line to tell the Commons that the alternative to her deal “will either be more uncertainty, more ision, or it could risk no Brexit at all”.Three Tory backbenchers thought to be loyal to Mrs May all spoke out to criticise the proposed deal - Neil Parish, Damian Collins and George Freeman.Slamming the deal’s controversial Irish backstop for threatening the UK’s integrity, Tiverton and Honiton MP Mr Parish told Mrs May: “I am a great supporter of yours and I accept what a dficult and tough job you have.“Please can I ask you to listen to these concerns and renegotiate the deal before you put it onto the floor of this House ”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn leaped on the government chaos to insist Mrs May’s deal was “dead”.But the PM hit back to repeat Mr Corbyn’s weekend gaffe back to him as she reminded MPs that he “hasn’t even read” the draft Brexit deal.Tory ministers have been told by No to expect the ‘meaningful vote’ on her deal to be held on December .Meanwhile Environment Secretary Michael Gove failed to give Eurosceptic MPs firm assurances that Britain will be free of EU quotas by January .Furious Brexiteers demanded he set a red line to ensure any extension of the transition period beyond December  will not apply to fishing.But Mr Gove wouldn’t give a final date for being outside the EU’s Commons Fisheries Policy - only saying Britain would become an “independent coastal state” after the transition period.He urged Eurosceptics: “We need to keep our eyes on the prize of making sure that after that transition period we can have all the opportunities to do the right thing environmentally, economically and socially.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want a good deal that sets us on course for a brighter future.That is within our grasp and I am determined to deliver it.Now Mrs May will embark on a -hour lobbying operation to convince European leaders they shouldnt veto the agreement at the last minute.As the Brexit deal neared completion:The admission that Britain can trade freely around the world while keeping the Irish border open came in a draft trade agreement between the UK and the EU - and represents a big win for the PM as she battles a Brexiteer rebellion back home.The document released today provides the future framework of a trade deal between the UK and EU, and is expected to be signed off on Sunday alongside the withdrawal agreement published last week.But a number of key issues remain apparently unresolved, with no agreement yet on fishing rights or the status of Gibraltar.And in a worrying sign for Brexiteers, it still states that the final deal will build and improve on the customs union which stops Britain cutting trade agreements around the world.Mrs May hopes that it will provide enough guarantees of future freedom to win over dozens of wavering Tories who are reluctant to back her deal when it comes to the Commons next month.She said today of her deal: I have just updated the Cabinet on progress and will be making statement to the Commons this afternoon.This is the right deal for the UK - it delivers on the result of the referendum and brings back control of our borders, our money and our laws.And it does so while protecting jobs, protecting our security and protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom.Laying out the next steps, Mrs May added: The agreement is between the UK and the European Commission.Hardline Brexit backers were quick to slam the document - Bernard Jenkin said it was far worse than the details revealed last week, while Steve Baker suggested it was an attempt to fool MPs into supporting the PM.On the key question of future customs arrangements, the text says: The Parties envisage making use of all available facilitative arrangements and technologies.It goes on: Such facilitative arrangements and technologies will also be considered in developing any alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.The Sun revealed earlier this week that secret plans were being drawn up in No to win back angry Brexiteers who have threatened to vote down her deal in the House of Commons.Both sides have now agreed on alternative arrangements that can be used to keep the border invisible.A technological solution to the border dilemma, known as maximum facilitation, was initially proposed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis but rejected by Mrs May last summer.The EU previously described it as magical thinking and pushed hard for the backstop which would keep Britain and the EU tied together for years to come.In todays report obtained by The Sun, officials stress the UK will be able to do our own trade deals around the world once we exit the transition period.They say any UK-EU pact will respect the result of the  referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the UK.But German diplomats are still worried it wont be locked down by tomorrow -

and it could bring down Theresa May. Documents running to  pages are set to be signed off on Sunday  November at a crucial EU summit. But evenits agreed by  EU leaders, the plan could be voted down in the House of Commons. Labour, the DUP and scores of Tory Brexiteers have threatened to defeat the entire pact. If they do, it would throw Brexit back to square one and could topple the Prime Minister. MPs are furious that the deal is too vague and could keep the UK locked under Brussels rules, with no say on making them. So what exactly does the deal say and why are people so het up about it  Weve taken a closer look.  The Brexit deal is in two parts - both of which could provoke a huge backlash. The first is the -page Withdrawal Agreement. This covers the UKs actual exit from the EU, and was agreed on November . The second is the -page Political Declaration on a Future Framework. This covers the shape of a future relationship and was agreed on November . If a deal isnt agreed, the UK will leave the EU on  March  with no deal. This is a No Deal Brexit.  These agreements are only in principle and need to be signed off by three groups. First there was the Cabinet. It agreed the deal but two Cabinet ministers - Dominic Raab and Esther McVey - resigned. Second - the deal needs to be signed off by  EU leaders at a Brussels summit on Sunday  November. Third and last - it needs to be signed off in a vote by MPs in Parliament before Christmas. There is a high risk Theresa May could lose this final vote.  What are the main points and problems in the Brexit deal  Weve looked at each part of the deal and looked at the main elements and sticking points. . The Withdrawal Agreement The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for  Weve signed up to a transition period that will continue pretty much all EU rules until December . Now this could be extended - and crucially, we dont yet know how long for. The deal only covers to the year xx. Which to put it mildly is a bit vague. This was then whittled down to , but only later. The transition period can only be extended once. And it would be done by the UK making a request before  June . This request would be considered by an arbitration . That  would have  UK members,  EU members and  independent member, chosen through a legal process. We dont know who theyd be. Eventhe transition period is extended we could still end up in a backstop. For more on that, read on...  Under the backstop - a backup plantheres no agreement for the Northern Ireland border - there COULD be checks on some goods between Northern Ireland and the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies say this is unacceptable. Northern Ireland firms will access the EU Single Market as a whole without restriction. This will mean Northern Ireland will have to apply EU law on industrial, environmental and agricultural goods. And that means some of these goods would need checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  The backstop -it kicks in on  January  - will extend EU customs rules across the whole of the UK. This makes Brexiteers furious because it will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world - and lock us into Brussels rules without any say on them. Whats worse, we can only quit the backstopthere is mutual agreement between the UK and the EU. Senior UK officials insisted the EU would have to act in good faith. But thatll be cold comfort to Tory Brexiteers. European courts will still have a big hold on the UK  Any judgements from the European Court of Justice handed down during the transition period will be binding on the UK. And the arbitration  that resolves disputeswill not intervene in cases involving EU law. Instead the European Court of Justice will rule on those questions. . The Future Framework Wed need deep co-operation with EU rules  The document promises comprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - which sounds like what Theresa May wanted. But it says that will need deep regulatory and customs cooperation. And it calls for common principles in the fields of standardisation, technical regulations, conformity assessment, accreditation, market surveillance, metrology and labelling. Translation: Thats a lot of EU rules were agreeing to follow. Brexiteers are likely to fear this will mean tacking close to EU laws with little freedom to break themwe want good trade. We could have to allow access to our fishing waters  The document commits Britain to establishing a “new fisheries agreement on [among other things], access to waters and quota shares from  January . In other words - it kicks the can down the road. The government says it has defeated EU demands for reciprocal access to UK waters. But Brexiteers fear Britain will have to give up access to its waters to fishing from EU rivals infor a trade deal. Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson said: “This means sovereignty over our waters sacriced for a trade deal. That is unacceptable. We must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway.” And Tory Bernard Jenkin said: “It is going to enrage the coastal communities that we have conceded our fishing grounds and quotas.” Scottish Secretary David Mundell, however, threw his weight behind the deal, crushing claims he would resign. Wed stay tied to European courtsThe document the European Court of Justice would still have a role in interpreting EU law when it comes to law enforcement. This is a blow to Brexiteers, who want to quit the jurisdiction of the ECJ. Britain has long promised close co-operation on security - saying its top spooks make that an offer the EU cant refuse. But the document warns: The closer and deeper the partnership the stronger the accompanying obligations. Wed respect Europes human rights laws  The document commits the UK to respect the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights . Right wing Tories hate the convention which protects freedoms such as the prohibition of torture, slavery, the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. Theresa May considered leaving the ECHR , in  but eventually decided it would not be possible while Brexit was underway. It was understood that she was going to make it a central plank of her re-election plan before calling an early election. But it underpins the Good Friday Agreement. Youll need a visa to go to the EU long-term  Visas wont be needed for short trips to the EU. But the document gives no such guarantee for long-term trips. This was widely expected, but will come as a blow to Remain campaigners . And finally... the whole thing is very vague  Take visas. What does a long-term trip mean  Take customs. What does deep co-operation mean  And more. Theres lots of very positive language but it kicks many cans down the road. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the document was full of unicorns and adds up to a blindfold Brexit. Furious Mark Francois, of the Tory Brexiteer battalion, branded the deal a fig leaf that is not legally binding and wont fool anybody. He told the BBC: It is  pages of political camouflage designed to take peoples eye off the withdrawal agreement and persuade them to vote it through. It will not work. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas. MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal.

She has to overcome two more major hurdles -  EU leaders at a summit on November , and finally a vote in the House of Commons. At both stages she could be thwarted - especially the last one. MPs are threatening mutiny over the Northern Ireland backstop, a customs backup plan that could leave the UK trapped in Brussels orbit. A lot is unknown, but here is the most likely timetable in the weeks and months ahead. Tuesday  November : After months of stalled talks over the Northern Irish border, and  days after the Brexit vote, a deal was finally reached at a technical level between the UK and EU. Wednesday  November: Ministers flooded to an emergency Cabinet meeting from pm that ran for more than four hours to sign off the deal. This was the first of three danger moments for the PM, and ministers were ordered to either back the deal or quit. Thursday  November: Cabinet ministers Esther McVey and Dominic Raab both resigned over the Brexit deal as Mrs May gave a statement to Parliament defending it. At the same time key Brexiteers launched a challenge to her leadership, forcing Mrs May into a defiant statement in Downing Street. Thursday  November: It emerged the second part of the deal - a political declaration on the future relationship - had been reached.  Sunday  November: An emergency EU summit with  other leaders in Brussels to sign off the deal. This will be danger moment number two for the Prime Minister, when she has to face down pro-EU leaders like Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel - and Spain, who threatened to block the deal over Gibraltar. Early December  A vote in the House of Commons on the deal. This is danger moment number three for Theresa May - and by far the worst. If the deal is voted down she will almost certainly have to resign or face a vote of no confidence. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table - see below. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces two more hurdles - an EU summit with  leaders on November , and then the vote in Parliament at some point before Christmas.

Thursday  December: The last chance EU Council summit. If the deal is rejected in the House of Commons, Theresa May could be forced to renegotiate parts of it with the other  EU leaders at this get-together in Brussels. Thursday  December: Parliament rises for its Christmas break. Unless MPs are recalled to Parliament - an incredibly rare move - this is the last chance to approve the Brexit deal in a second meaningful vote. If its rejected a second time, that really could be curtains for the PM. Labour say there should be a general election orthat fails, even a second EU referendum. The EU has agreed a two-part Brexit deal - and it has enraged Tories. Here are some of the reasons why:The transition period can be extended - and we dont know how long for Goods face being checked between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop European courts will still have a big hold on the UK Wed need deep co-operation with EU rules We could have to allow access to our fishing waters And finally... the whole thing is very vagueFOR THE FULL GUIDE CLICK HERE January to March : Dozens of national and regional parliaments across the EU will hold their own votes on the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, No Deal planning has to ramp up in case everything doesnt come together in time.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.   December : Transition ends. If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - is supposed to end. Only at this point will the much-discussed Brexit deal actually kick in. But this date could be extended .  January : Backstop kicks in. If theres still no deal to stop customs checks on the Northern Ireland border, under current plans a backstop would kick in. This could keep the UK tied to EU customs rules, until a proper agreement is reached, in exchange for keeping the Northern Ireland border open. June : The next scheduled general election. Amazingly, the transition period -it gets extended - could still be going on at this point.  December : The transition period might finally end. What happensa deal is voted down   If MPs do not vote for the PM’s deal, she says the UK defaults to a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario could trigger a crisis in the financial markets, plummeting sterling and adding to an unprecedented political crisis. But she also says it could result in no Brexit at all. Thats a cryptic way of saying she could be forced to:Renegotiate the deal Resign from office Hold a general election Hold a second EU referendumTheresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign.

UnknownLABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against. What would happen immediatelythe deal is voted down  Constitutionally, the Government must decide what happens next. Ministers have to come to Parliament by  January to make a statement setting out their proposals. Will the PM quit or face a leadership challengeshe loses the vote   Few Tory MPs seem happy with Mrs May’s leadership but important factors have somehow managed to keep her in power to date, and they haven’t changed. Tory MPs know they are likely to face voters’ anger and there is no agreed successor. If she resigns it could still be messy. Will there be an election  It doesnt happen automatically. There are two dferent ways it can happen under the law. . Theresa May loses a vote of confidence in the Commons - by a simple majority . If that happens, convention suggests she must resign and nominate a new PM. That PM has  days to win enough support. If they cant, the new PM must then hold a general election. . MPs vote directly for a new election. This vote, however, would have to pass with a two-thirds majority of all MPs. Can Brexit be stopped   Some argue the only real deadline for a deal is  March . As long as a deal has been struck, and approved by Parliament in a meaningful vote by Brexit day, then Article  can be extended in order for the legislation to be passed. This could mean that evena deal was voted down the first time round it could be put in front of MPs again, possibly early next year. Meanwhile, campaigners are calling for a second EU referendum that could cancel Article  altogether. If it did happen, this would probably need Article  to be extended as well.

The government carried out a review after campaigners claimed that hundreds of highly skilled workers were facing removal due to minor discrepancies between immigration paperwork sent to the Home Office and tax information given to HMRC. Ministers insisted the majority of those refused entry under Tier visas were not because of minor tax errors but were instead attempts to misrepresent self-employed earnings to be given leave to stay in the UK. The government also faced criticism for refusing entry based on paragraph  where an applicant’s character and conduct call into question their desirability of remaining in the UK. The review found that at least people may have been affected. As well as cases which have already been allowed by the courts and tribunals, the review has identied  decisions the government will overturn. There are a further  cases where the Home Office needs more information before reconsidering their cases.   The Home Office say they will contact each of the  iniduals concerned to resolve their cases by the end of December. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said in a statement: Errors of this kind are always regrettable, and I do not seek to minimise the impact that the error may have had on the iniduals concerned.I will also ensure that the findings in this small minority of cases are used to inform our future decision making, to ensure that similar errors are not repeated. Skilled migrants make an important contribution to our economic wellbeing and our society. The Government recognises the need to attract and retain them, and our immigration system will continue to do so. However, it is important that people play by the rules to preserve the integrity of the immigration system. The governments review examined , applications refused since January . The discrepancies between the earnings declared to the Home Office and those shown by their tax records were over pound, in % of cases , according to the review.

But five days later the company told him he would not be receiving the money because there had been a software mal. The dad-of-two turned down a pound, settlement, which required a nondisclosure agreement, and is now fighting his case in the High Court. He said: They [Betfred] are quick to take peoples money but when it comes to paying out they offered money as a gagging agreement. They have buried their head in the sand. How many are there out there who have signed similar agreements  Ive been bullied. Im just a fish in a big sea and they are a great big shark but Im not going to be forced away just because they are worth billions and Im not. Eventhere was a glitch I did nothing wrong.

Peter Coyle, Andrews solicitor, claims the company has refused repeated requests to provide evidence of the computer problem. A preliminary High Court hearing was told this week that the company did not have the game data and could not force the game developer to hand it over. Andrew added: Because I won and for four days they congratulated me for being a millionaire, they should honour that bet.

Unfortunately, and as Mr Green is aware, a new game release suffered a software mal in January this year and no legitimate jackpot win occurred.

A coroner had been set to deliver a verdict following the death of -year-old Jessica Scatterson, who was found dead in her bedroom in Bewsey, near Warrington. The tragedy happened in April last year after allegations that she had been bullied at her school, Penketh High in Warrington. Jessica had previously self-harmed, her pals said, and left suicide notes, the Liverpool Echo reports. Proceedings were stopped after an unexpected phone call from a member of the public. He had seen media reports about the case, and telephoned the Warrington Coroners Office yesterday to claim his two daughters moved to a dferent school after problems with bullying some years ago.   The man, whose identity was not disclosed, claimed there were systematic failings at Penketh High which was only tolerated by his eldest daughter until her GCSE year after which she left the school. He had written to the Department for Education in October  to voice his fears, which pre-dated Jessicas death, and had received an email reply back from the government department, Alan Moore, the senior coroner for Cheshire, said. The sudden interruption led to furious scenes at Warrington Town Hall, with dad Chris Scatterson believing the correspondence needed further investigation and a halt to the inquest.   But Jessicas upset mother, Rachel Dawber, demanded the enquiry continue. Mr Scatterson told the coroner: My feelings on it is, are the school covering it [bullying] up  I think this is relevant. A relative, and supporter of the dad, added: I feel that its relevant to Jessicas case and maybe her state of mind. It seems as though the way she reacted to some of these messages....that affected her state of mind.   Coroner Moore replied: I must make some further enquiries...well obtain a statement from the gentleman concerned, and Ill have a statement from the principal at the school... I completely sympathise with Ms Dawber, but my job here is to investigate fully, fairly, and fearlessly on anything that might have had a bearing on her death. Im so sorry, I had no idea this gentleman would approach us, but it would be utterly inappropriate for me not to share that with you. Im so sorry about that.  Earlier this morning, Penketh High headteacher John Carlin had told the inquest that, since Jessicas death, he had implemented new policies on bullying and self harm at the school, and had employed an emotional well-being coordinator. The inquest heard how Jessica had spoken to teachers about her dficult home le, and unpleasant messages between her and her friends were discovered on her social media accounts. The -year-olds pals had told police that she had previously self-harmed, and officers said they had become aware of an incident ‘relating to Jessica being bullied at school’ in April . Jessica had come home with scratches to her face and a swollen eye after arguing with another girl. The matter was reported to the police but it was unclear who had started the fight so no action was taken.

Weddings are very emotional events, and as Diana tragically has not lived to see her boys grow up and marry Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of York confessed that her best mate was at the forefront of her mind. Speaking on Good Morning Britain on Wednesday, she said that attending Harry and Meghans wedding was so nerve wracking that she was reduced to tears at one point. The minute I started to walk [from the car] I kept thinking of Diana in my heart.  As I came around to corner, the thing that made me cry was the kind people who had been so lovely, plus Jack [Brooksbank] was standing there, and coming towards me with open arms. It was just very moving. Fergie also opened up on how much she misses her friend, praising her brilliant sense of humour. I was really happy for my friend Diana, who I love ... I miss her. No one made me laugh better than her. She was hilarious, she said.  She also spoke about how proud she thinks Diana would be of her Prince William and Prince Harry for marrying women like Kate and Meghan - which undoubtedly means a lot to them. “Shed really just be so proud, Fergie said. Even before they got married, Diana would have been just literally going I cant believe these boys have done so well. She added that Diana would be proud of Meghan and Kate too and would want to give them a hug and praise their excellent work.

Sarah McGuiness gave birth to her son Max Williams at just  weeks after going into early labour. Despite medics best efforts to slow down the pregnancy, Max was born breathing, but weighed just lb and oz. Sarah, from Llanwit Major in South Wales, said she lived in constant fear her fragile son wouldnt survive - and one night was terried she had lost him forever. While staying at the University Hospital of Wales, Sarah had been getting some sleep on the ward while her partner Chris sat at Maxs incubator in the intensive care baby unit. After checking her phone one last time before going to sleep, she saw the words RUN pop up on the screen in a text from Chris, reports Wales Online. Max had stopped breathing after something became trapped in his airways. Despite being revived, he stopped breathing three more times that night before one one occasion all alarms were set off and a crash team came in to work on him. Sarah and Chris watched on in disbelief as the team worked to save their newborn sons le.  Describing the horric moment they thought theyd lose Max, Sarah said: I’ve never moved as quickly as I did that night. “It usually takes a while to get buzzed through the doors of the women’s unit, but someone must have seen how I was running because they opened straight away. “When I arrived, there was a team working on Max. Something had got stuck in his airway and he’d stopped breathing. “They managed to revive him but it happened three more times, once when I was holding him and he just turned blue in my hands. “Suddenly all the alarms were going off and the crash team rushed in. We were left standing in the corner of the room feeling a terror that’s hard to describe. “I don’t think that memory of being on the brink of losing everything but being unable to change any of it will ever leave us. Sarah had been having a normal pregnancy up until the morning of her -week scan, when she realised she was bleeding. A midwe referred her straight to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where tests revealed she was in early labour. She was given injections to try and slow down labour, medication to help mature the baby’s brain and lungs and was told she might deliver before the end of the day.   In the space of just a few short hours, Sarah and partner Chris Williams lives changed forever. Sarah said: “I started shaking uncontrollably at that point, out of shock I think more than anything. “And it was then that the midwe whispered words in to my ear that I think helped to save all three of us in the days that were to come. “She hugged me really tight and told me that I couldn’t cry now. She said that my stress and adrenaline could speed up labour and my job was to stay as calm as possible. “In a situation that was suddenly and very dramatically out of our control, it gave me a focus.” The pair were rushed to the University Hospital of Wales where they were prepared for the imminent birth of their baby. But the medication to slow the labour seemed to work, giving them hope that the pregnancy might progress for another few weeks at least. The following morning, Sarah woke up in a pool of blood and was convinced that she’d lost the baby. An examination revealed that she was cm dilated. The baby was still alive but she was now in full labour. Sarah added: “From then on we were on one major countdown. We knew that every minute the baby stayed inside would help so we celebrated each hour that passed. “But the pain got worse as the days progressed, and we knew that there was no stopping the inevitable.   “I was told to push when I was ready and I remember Chis saying ‘whatever happens next, our baby is about to be born’. In that moment we felt so happy.” Baby Max was born tiny but breathing, although it took some time for the neonatal team to get all the necessary tubes into him. Chris and Sarah said they couldn’t see Max from where they sitting, so they avidly watched everyone’s expressions for signs that he was okay. Eventually, and to their complete surprise, they were given the opportunity to hold their new son. Sarah said in those few seconds they felt immense pride and a confidence that Max would survive. For the first few weeks, Sarah and Chris quickly learnt to adapt to the routine of le on the neonatal ward with their new son. For  precious seconds twice a day, the new parents took it in turns to hold him through the incubator windows while his sheets were being changed. They celebrated each tiny bit of progress and laughed at how he would suck avidly at the cotton bud dipped in Sarah’s milk, which they used to keep his mouth clean and moist.   But at around the two-week mark things began to change - and Max began to struggle with his breathing on the night Sarah received the dreaded text. With Max’s condition continuing to deteriorate, a decision was made to start him on a course of steroids. It was the only option left open, but given the very long and frightening list of potential side-effects – including partial but permanent paralysis – it was a very frightening thing for Chris and Sarah to consent to. Max was paralysed and sedated and placed on an oscillator breathing machine to keep his lungs permanently inflated while the medication took effect. Sarah and Chris were painfully aware that the longer he was dependent on the machinery to breathe for him, the worse his chances for a normal le were going to be. Thankfully the steroids did their job and, very slowly, Max’s condition started to improve. Each day, the consultants would make the smallest adjustment, trying to work out the best course of action for Max. Sarah added: “Each baby and each situation is very dferent and there are so many components in the care of a neonatal baby.   “I have so much respect for the medical team who painstakingly and meticulously took the tiniest of calculated risks every day to work out what was best for Max. “That takes real bravery and determination.” Eventually, Max was well enough to come off the ventilator and be moved out of intensive care on to the high dependency unit . But even though the family were one step closer to home, some of their darkest days were yet to come. Shortly after moving on to HDU Max was diagnosed with stage  retinopathy of prematurity , an eye condition that can cause blindness in premature babies. Sarah and Chris were told that to be in with a chance of saving Max’s sight, he would need laser eye surgery under anaesthetic. This would mean ato the ventilator and the intensive care unit. Sarah said: “The thought of going back to the place that filled us with such dficult memories terried us, but the fear I felt at the prospect of Max being blind just grabbed hold of me and wouldn’t let go. “Through the whole journey I’d comforted myself by daydreaming about all the tiny normal things we could do together in the future, like walking down the street jumping in puddles. “Now even that seemed like it was being taken away.” Still a full month away from his official due date, Max was taken to theatre for surgery. He spent two days on the ventilator before ing to HDU. Then came the wait to find out whether the surgery had been a success.   During this time Max was also having dficulty learning to swallow and would often choke and stop breathing for periods of time. Eventually, despite his setbacks, Max was finally well enough to go home – a week after his official due date – and his parents received the news that his eye surgery had been a success. Max required home oxygen and some feeding support for a few months after “graduating” from the hospital. Sarah said she’d expected the mixture of fear and excitement she felt on the day they finally went home. What she hadn’t expected was the sadness at having to say goodbye to the neonatal team. “We developed such a strong bond with so many special nurses and consultants who’d cared for Max that it was dficult to leave them behind,” she said. “They’d got us through the hardest possible of times by showing care, compassion and even humour at times. “We’ll never forget these nurses and all the staff. We wouldn’t be a family today without them.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poo found ice soft drinks","story":"NewsPoo found in ice and soft drinks served by these favourite pub chainsFaecal bacteria was found at Harvester, Hungry Horse, JD Wetherspoon, Slug and Lettuce, and Marston’s Two For OneShareByNada Farhoud:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsBacteria were found at Harvester, Hungry Horse, JD Wetherspoon, Slug and Lettuce, and Marston’s Two For One last month \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIce and soft drinks served at pub chains was contaminated with faecal bacteria, an investigation found.

Jade Turner, , built a large following on her social media page but had few friends and a boyfriend who became violent and sent a picture of him with another woman in bed, leaving her destroyed. The catering assistant openly spoke about taking her own le and even suggested she would go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to die by assisted suicide. Miss Turner, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, had sent messages to her mother reading I love you mum and I‘m sorry before she suffered an overdose on July . She was later found dead in her flat - where she had a book on suicide in her bedroom - after her father raised the alarm, the inquest was told.  The hearing was told Miss Turner had been diagnosed with Aspergers and autism aged  and had enrolled on a Living with Autism course. But she was said to have hated her condition and often isolated herself and she did not have many friends whilst having a large presence of , followers on Facebook. Her mother, Lesley Robinson, told the Bolton hearing: “After the diagnosis the depression she suffered with got worse. She always wanted to be on her own. She had a relationship with a boy and that ended and then met someone called Anthony and moved in with him for six months.  “She seemed happy at first but then there were problems with the relationship and Jade moved in with me. She wanted to be independent and joined a separate living group - she had to leave after  months and moved into a flat. “She saw it as a new adventure. One of her many problems was Facebook. She got a lot of trolls and got into Facebook relationships with boys. She met people she knew on Facebook in real le but she became concerned about her appearance and felt insecure. The last boyfriend became violent and sent a picture of him with another woman in bed and this destroyed her. This badly affected her and broke down their relationship. Her depression became worse. Nothing could change her mind and she had thought she would end her own le.  Miss Turners mother added: “We would sit together and talk about how she felt but nothing to change her mind set. She hated her condition and said she was stuck with it for le. “One Saturday th we met up and had coffee. She sent me a message later and I said ‘stay strong’.

She had never done any harm to herself before.

She even mentioned going to Switzerland to end her le by euthanasia. I was not aware that she did anything to hurt herself. “She would get down and said her condition was getting her down. She couldn’t hold down a job and found it hard to find a job. “She felt lonely and would come over sometimes but would always go home, she would never stay.

Police found a book on suicide in her bedroom and she left notes in her phone to inidual family members. Jodie Wood, senior mental health practitioner, said: “I saw her on th July for an initial assessment. She was experiencing low mood following her relationship breakdown.

She said she became obsessed with this and said it was down to her autism. “I recommended her for a Living with Autism course and referred her for CBT. She said she had no intention to complete the act and that she had future plans. She was scared of dying. Coroner Alan Walsh recorded a conclusion of suicide and said: “I am satisfied she had a number of complexities. She had a number of relationships of which none were sustained. Some were bad for her and had a bad effect on her. “She had continuous support from her mother and father. There were times where she isolated herself.

Featuring in any number of famous films and telly favourites, the holiday is easily on a par with Christmas for most in the USA. Families come together to share a feast centred around turkey, take in massive parades and watch American football. Lots of expat Americans living this side of the Atlantic will celebrate Thanksgiving too, but many Brits wont have a clue what exactly is being honoured. So heres everything you need to know about the festivities on this most American of holidays:  When is Thanksgiving  Without exception, Thanksgiving always falls on the fourth Thursday of November. In , thats Thursday  November. In the US, government offices, businesses and schools close on Thanksgiving Day - with many closing on the Friday after, too, giving employees a four-day weekend. Whats the origin of Thanksgiving   The celebration of Thanksgiving is, in general, a feast to give thanks for the fruits of the previous harvest. In America specically, it dates back to the s. Theres some discussion over when the first Thanksgiving was, but many think it dates back to , when the harvest was celebrated by the Pilgrims - Dutch settlers of the Plymouth Colony in whats now called Massachusetts. This feast lasted three days, and was attended by  Native Americans and  Pilgrims. It spread through the country and was celebrated on dferent days in dferent communities until, in , George Washington declared the first national Thanksgiving Day.  The traditional Thanksgiving meal revolves around turkey, stuffing and vegetables. Youll also hear Americans talking about eating yams. Yams are a starchy root vegetable grown in the Carribean. But usually when Americans talk about yams, they actually mean sweet potatoes. The meal is traditionally rounded off with a pumpkin pie. What  goes on   Many big cities hold a Thanksgiving Day parade, the most famous of which is the Macys parade in New York. The three-hour event features floats, costumes and huge helium balloons in the shape of cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat. Playing and watching American football is a long held Thanksgiving tradition. NFL and college have played over the Thanksgiving weekend practically since the games invention, and its one of the biggest days in the football calendar. #cite_note-Encyclop.C.Adia_Britannica-\" rel\"nofollow\" Does everyone in the US celebrate Thanksgiving  No. Many Indigenous Americans, who were displaced by the settlers, understandably choose not to celebrate Thanksgiving. Indeed, many groups actively protest against what they see as an offensive glorication of a group of people who plundered and stole their land and brought them, among other delights, syphilis. How does Thanksgiving relate to Black Friday  The years most terrying shopping day, Black Friday started in the US and always falls on the day after Thankgiving. Many states in the US have Thankgiving and the day after as public holidays, so people have a lot of spare time after the festivities and nothing to do but shop. Traditionally it marked the start of the Christmas shopping season, and many stores open early and put on big sales. In recent years, the Monday after Black Friday has become known as Cyber Monday - the busiest online shopping day of the year. Like Black Friday, many online retailers have sales on.  When might I have seen Thanksgiving on screen  Many Brits idea of Thanksgiving comes from the annual holiday episodes of Friends. They were some of the classic sitcoms best loved episodes. Youll remember Chandler boycotting the holiday because it reminded him of his parents orce and the time when a Macys parade balloon escaped and the cartoon character Underdog flew away - leading to the gang being locked out of Monicas apartment while the turkey burned. But the best screen representation of Thanksgiving has to be the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles, starring Steve Martin and John Candy. Its the story of two strangers who instantly hate each other, but are forced to work together to navigate holiday transport madness to get home for the weekend. Often misremembered as a Christmas film due to the snowy backdrop, its not only hilarious, but gives you a great sense of how chaotic Thanksgiving weekend can be.

Nichol Kessinger said Watts, who didnt wear a wedding ring around her, did not show any emotion after he told her his family had gone missing.However ,autopsy reports for his we and kids show the full horror of how he murdered them. The -year-old dad smothered his daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three, and strangled -year-old we Shanann before hiding their bodies. On Monday, Watts was given five le sentences, jailed without the possibility of parole.Ms Kessinger, who went to the police after Shanann and the girls disappeared on August , broke her silence in an interview with the Denver Post. His -year-old lover said Watts appeared to be a doting father but he turned out to be a serial liar who didnt wear a wedding ring and claimed he and Shanann had separated and were going through a orce.  She said: “He made me believe that he was doing all of the things that a rational man and good father would do. She added: Hes a liar. He lied about everything. Ms Kessinger said she did not know the truth about Watts marriage until the mother and her girls vanished.  Autopsy reports for the victims show that all three of them were asphyxiated to death and its believed young Bella could have fought for her le, reports say. There was purple-black bruising on Shananns neck and possible abrasions up the left side of her face which showed a traumatic injury, the report said.

Chris Watts scraped the body of his four-year-old daughter Bella as he shoved her into an oil tank after also murdering her sister and his pregnant we.The harrowing account of events told to the court detailed how Bella fought for le and bit her tongue as dad suffocated her.Her body was then scraped as he pushed her through a small hatch in the oil tank where he hid her and her sister Celestes bodies.  Their pregnant mother Shanann was buried in a shallow grave nearby. While looking for the missing mum and daughters, investigators found a tuft of soft blonde hair on one of the tanks.

Keith Williams spent  years grafting in his adoptive father’s coal business in South Wales before deciding to trace his biological roots. And the -year-old could never have imagined the astonishing discovery he was to make. The humble Carmarthenshire man known as Keith y Glowas the illegitimate firstborn son of the rd Sultan of Perak in Malaysia. He flew out to try to meet his new family but claims that following initial contact he was given the cold shoulder. And while stressing he has no interest in vying for the throne, he is now shydetermined to claim any inheritance his royal father may have left him.  Keith said: “It is a shame they have decided to close ranks on me. I understandthey feel threatened but it’s not like I am claiming the throne. I am sure my father knew about me andhe did I am sure he would have left something behind for me and I think it is only right I know about it.” When Keith learned of his origins, it was too late to make contact with his father, Idris Iskandar Al-Mutawakkil Alallahi Shah, as he died in . Keith’s mum, Elizabeth Rosa, was  and a trainee nurse at a children’s hospital in Carshalton, Surrey, when she met the royal while he was studying in the UK. They had a whirlwind affair and she became pregnant.  Elizabeth was forced to go home to Swansea and give up Keith for adoption, and the prince was sent back to Malaysia to avoid a scandal. After his , he served as the state’s rd Sultan of Perak from  until his death. Malaysia has nine Sultanates and the families live opulent lestyles in palaces. It is unclear what Keith’s family are worth but business magazine Forbes has revealed the current Sultan’s daughter, Eleena Azlan Shah, was worth poundmillion in . However, Keith, of Penygroes, stresses his move is not about greed. He said: “Of course they are worth a considerable amount. I am not interested in their money, I just want to knowmy father may have left me anything.  “If it was confirmed that there was some sort of inheritance, why wouldn’t I be interested  It is something he would have wanted me to have, isn’t it  “My father was known as the ‘People’s Sultan’ – everybody liked him, from what I have researched. I am sure he would want the best for me.” Keith says evenhe was left nothing, it would still mean the world to him for the family to simply pick up the phone. During a visit to Malshyshyaysia, he met half-sister Ku Ess and visited his father’s tomb. After the current sultan Nazrin Shah dies, the next will be Keith’s younger half-brother. He revealed he had a DNA test showing Asian ancestry and he has inquired about Malaysian citizenship but heard nothing back.  Keith said: “To be honshyshyest, I find it sad and a little annoying they are ignoring me. At one point we were in touch all the time and they even agreed to a DNA test. But now they cannot evenan email. “It is sad. I just want to get to know them and learn about my father. I am convinced he knew about me. When my mum got pregnant and went into care and came back to South Wales, she wrote letters to him. In one, he gave her a photo of the palace with the phone number and address on the back. You don’t do that for one-night stands, do you  “I am certain he would have known about me but the establishment would have stopped him doing anything about it.” Keith is also writing a book about his incredible story, which he hopes to publish soon.

The indigenous Sentinelese were already one of the most feared and mysterious tribes in the world before they killed American missionary John Allen Chau, who was trying to convert them. Very little is known about the tiny group or their ways, as few people who have met them have lived to tell the tale. The hunter-and-gatherer tribe fires a flurry of arrows at anyone who approaches by boat and even tries to attack low-flying planes or helicopters on reconnaissance missions. It lives in complete isolation on what looks like an idyllic Indian Ocean island that is said to have been populated for , years.  The Sentinelese - considered the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world - have rejected modern civilisation and have no contact with the outside world. Few photographs or videos exist, and it is not even known what they call themselves. One thing is for certain, however. Their reputation is fearsome. They have killed a number of outsiders who have strayed onto or too close to the island, which belongs to India and is about the size of Manhattan, over the years. In , the tribe killed two men who were fishing illegally in waters in the Bay of Bengal. The men had moored their boat near the island to sleep, but they were killed when the boat broke loose and drted onto the shore.  A tribesman was pictured firing an arrow at an Indian Coast Guard helicopter checking on the groups welfare after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in . Members wear little clothing and they live off the land and the fish that they catch. They are known to make narrow canoes that are propelled with a pole like a punt and are only used in shallow waters, according to Survivor International. Their rituals are a mystery. It is thought that they live in three small bands, residing in large communal huts with several hearths for multiple families, and temporary, single-family shelters with no sides. Survivor International, a group that pushes for tribal peoples rights, said the women wear fibre strings tied around their waists, necks and heads, while the men also wear necklaces and headbands, but with a thicker waist belt.  The men carry spears, bows and arrows that they use to hunt or attack outsiders who stray too close. For tools or arrow tips, the uncontacted tribe has used metal which has washed up on shore or been recovered from shipwrecks on reefs. Survivor International said the islanders are clearly extremely healthy and thriving, unlike the Great Andamanese tribes that were colonised by the British in the s. It says on its website: The people who are seen on the shores of North Sentinel look proud, strong and healthy and at any one time observers have noted many children and pregnant women. The size of North Sentinel Islands population remains a mystery.  India has tried to carry out official counts by air, but the island has dense forest. The government has tried to make contact with the group, largely without success. On a few occasions, the Sentinelese allowed officials to get close enough to hand over coconuts. According to Survival International, in the late s, Maurice Vidal Portman, a British naval officer who pacied Andamanese tribes, landed on North Sentinel Island with a large team to make contact. They discovered abandoned villages and paths, and didnt come across the first islanders - an elderly couple and children - until a few days later. They took the couple and children to Port Blair, on South Andaman Island, in the interest of science, but they soon fell ill and the adults died, Survivor International said.  The children were ed to the island with gts. Experts say its likely that the children passed on their illness to other tribe members, possibly with devastating results. In the s, Indian authorities tried to befriend the tribe, leaving two pigs and a doll on the beach during one trip. The Sentinelese speared and buried the pigs, along with the doll. During other visits, coconuts, bananas and bits of iron were left as gts. On some occasions, tribe members made friendly gestures. On others, they took the gts into the forest and then fired arrows at the officials. In the s and s, several members of the tribe were killed by armed salvagers who were recovering irons and other goods from a shipwreck, it was reported.  Survivor International said there appeared to be a breakthrough for Indias government in , when tribesmen approached without weapons for the first time and waded into the sea towards the contact partys boat to collect more coconuts. But officials were met with attacks during later visits. India halted regular visits in  amid concerns for the well-being of the tribe. Officials still make periodic checks from afar, but India has banned people from getting close to the Sentinelese, while allowing them to carry on with their way of le. It passed a law making it illegal to try to contact the tribe or travel within three miles of North Sentinel Island. In , the Indian Coast Guard apprehended seven men who were fishing illegally.  One of the men is said to have briefly set foot on the island before getting back on a boat unscathed. Last week, the tribe killed Mr Chau, a -year-old missionary from Vancouver, Washington, and buried his body on the beach as he tried to convert its members. Before he was killed, he wrote in his journal that tribesmen, about ft ins tall and wearing yellow paste on their faces, reacted angrily as he tried to speak their language and sing worship songs to them during his initial approach on November . He shouted at them: My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you. He brought gts including a football and fish. But the group reacted angrily and one of the younger members fired an arrow, which pierced his waterproof Bible, and he retreated, the Washington Post reported.  He went on shore the next day, on November . It was the last time he was seen alive by the fishermen who took him to the island. The following day, last Saturday, they watched as islanders dragged and buried his body on the beach. In his last note to his family, Mr Chau wrote: “God, I don’t want to die. His mother, Lynda Adams-Chau, doesnt believe the reports that he was killed. She told the Post: I believe he is still alive. Asked why, she replied: “My prayers.” In an earlier Instagram post, Mr Chaus heartbroken family paid tribute to the adventurer and said they forgive his killers. The post read: “He was a beloved son, brother, uncle, and best friend to us. To others he was a Christian missionary, a wilderness EMT, an international soccer coach, and a mountaineer.  He loved God, le, helping those in need, and he had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people.” Indian authorities have detained the fishermen who took Mr Chau to the island, and a friend in Port Blair who helped to organise the trip. It was unclear whether officials would attempt to make contact with the tribe and recover Mr Chaus body. A helicopter was sent to the area to conduct reconnaissance on Tuesday. A separate team was travelling to the area on Wednesday. Survivor International has pushed for the tribes protection to be maintained and respected, saying it is very vulnerable to diseases due to its extreme isolation. It says on its website: They vigorously reject all contact with outsiders. It is vital that their wish to remain uncontacted is respected –not, the entire tribe could be wiped out by diseases to which they have no immunity. Contact imposed upon other Andaman tribes has had a devastating impact. Following a campaign by Survival and local organisations, the Indian government abandoned plans to contact the Sentinelese. Survival is campaigning to ensure that their current position – to not make further attempts to contact the tribe – is maintained.

Gerald Hough, manager of JJ Houghs Singing Pub in Banagher, Co Offaly, and the short films director, made the advert to raise discussion about smartphones and family. Its a social commentary on technology and how its not all bad, but also how we can use them to our benefit and improve our lives, he told the Press Association. The film revolves around an elderly gentleman who, frustrated with everyone in the pub gawping at their smartphone screens, chops down the nearest telegraph pole with a chainsaw.  Without TVs or technology to distract them, the locals gather at the JJ Houghs to talk, laugh and celebrate Christmas together. The finale sees the elderly man receives his own smartphone for Christmas and take a selfie with the grinning crowd, only to be found sat in the corner at the end, addicted to his device as the credits roll.  I dont want people to cast away technology, its more about how we can have balance and a bit of harmony between the analogue people and the digital people, Hough said. This is the third year in a row Hough, , has made a Christmas ad for the pub, the first focusing on a man who lost his presents and the second, Drone Alone, highlighting issues around loneliness at Christmas and how technology might help.  The latest film, titled Digital De-Houghx, was shot in the first weekend of November and, as is the norm, features a song by Houghs cousin Ultan Conlon. His music just has a nice melancholic ring to it that goes with these videos, Hough said. One person called it the best Christmas advert this year. Christmas is for spending time with family, friends and loved ones, so be smart this Christmas and put the phones away and create memories that will last a letime , they wrote.  Love it, absolute love the message in the story line. Happy Xmas to u all, wrote another. Hough added: Were in uncharted territory with some new technologies and we have to learn how to balance this I guess. Like anything its all about moderation, whether its exercise or alcohol.

The primary school teacher always had nervous tendencies but it came to a head following the birth of her first child. The -year-old was constantly worried thatshe put her son down then something bad might happen to him.  Speaking to Mail Online, she said: When he was born, we were so excited and so relieved that he was alive, I just cuddled him so much. But because we had held him for so long, when we did try to put him down, it didnt happen – and that was when the worries started. I was worried thatI put him in the pram, someone might knock the pram or something would happen. Our bassinet was like a dust collector.

Under previous manager Gordon Strachan, he made one sub appearance against England in the - draw in June last year, despite performing at a high level in the English Premier League.After Strachan left as manager, he also made a sub appearance in the - loss to the Netherlands at Pittodrie under Malky Mackay.Fraser, who left the Dons in January , currently has the most assists in the English Premier League with six and is enjoying being given opportunities with Scotland.The -year-old said: “Gordon Strachan gave me my debut against England but then I didn’t really see the pitch after that.“I was doing well for Bournemouth, but that’s what happens, he had other players he wanted to pick in front of me.“The gaffer here has shown faith in me and I’m just trying to repay him.“I’ve been doing well this season and I just try to enjoy it.“I don’t put any pressure on myself, what will be will be. Who knows at the end of the season what my targets might be.“I don’t know what’s behind my start to the season really. I think part of it is having confidence and believing in yourself.“I don’t think about it too much and get uptight about what I need to do.“I just go on the pitch and try my best –it doesn’t come off, it doesn’t come off. There’s a maturity as well because I’m  now, I’m getting on a bit.”Fraser says Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe has played a big part in boosting his confidence, along with former Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy when he had a loan spell at Portman Road in the   season.He added: “Eddie Howe and Mick McCarthy have helped with self-belief, but it’s probably come from me the most.“It can sometimes be hard for managers to give you belief, but you need to give it to yourself.“Sometimes you get moments in games which might spark something for you and I’ve had that this season.”Fraser believes Scotland showed a lot of resilience to come from a goal down on Tuesday night to beat Israel - at Hampden.He said: “It was a bad start and it took a lot of character and was a big test to come through what we came through.“To go - up takes a lot of courage and even in the last game against Albania people were saying it should be a walkover.“But Wales got beat by Albania on Tuesday and they played a strong team with Gareth Bale playing.“I think that needs to be recognised as well because we took the form from that game into the Israel game, which is nice.”In the matches against both Israel and Albania, McLeish fielded a young inexperienced side due to the raft of injury withdrawals from his squad.Fraser thinks having a young team with few caps has advantages and disadvantages.He said: “In patches the lack of experience shows how it can be good and in patches it shows how it can be bad.“We did well to go - up and then there was a little bit of inexperience to concede the goal and then it was nervous at the end.“It’s not nice in that sense – but everyone being young and ambitious helps with people going forward and scoring goals.“I think we scored more goals in the two games than Scotland have scored for a while.“Hopefully that can help get the fans off their seatswe’re playing expansive football.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 34","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowWe head Loch Caolisport for this week#s reader#s photograph.It was taken by Delores Firth of Ormsary from her garden looking down towards Loch Caolisport and Ellary.Delores said: #The cloud formations were my real focus when I took this picture.#Send your favourite photographs to the Argyllshire Advertiser for publication.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Star lost possession in midfield and Connor Crawford’s clearance was closed down by the Kings Park forward whose shot beat Kalache from the edge of the box and the hosts took a - lead on the hour mark.This visibly knocked the confidence of the Star team and Kings added a second goal when poor play again from Star trying to break gted possession to the hosts and once again their striker was on hand to make it - and give Star a mountain to climb in the last twenty minutes.Star didn’t give up however and could have been back in the game when the ball fell to Gregor Peacock in the box, the ing striker hit the shot and the ball was saved by the Kings Park goalkeeper.Kyle Selfridge went close to claiming a late leline but his free kick from twenty yards cannoned off the bar and the game finished - to the home side.The Star management team were disappointed as that’s the first time the Lochgilphead side have failed to score in the league in more than two years.On Saturday November  Red Star play host to Campbeltown pupils in what looks like another tough league match.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13594714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_ayr-u.jpg","title":"ayr united appear itv show","story":"NewsAyr United appear on ITV show The Chase as Bradley Walsh asks questionsThe Honest Men appeared as an answer on hit ITV show The Chase yesterday .Share.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\".\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _CLR_GLG_chase_.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByLochlin Highet:,  NOV NewsThe Chasers \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United have been flying high at the top of the Championship - and now theyve made prime time national TV.

He said: “That is a long time in the hospitality sector. It has been very successful in that time.”Referencing food trends, he said research showed people buying breakfasts and takeaways was on the increase.He added: “The building we built  years ago is not as fit for purpose as it was then. We want to bash it about a bit.”Mr Blair said the current retractable roof in the terrace area was “impractical.”The frontage of the building will be remodelled with awnings installed.A glazed atrium will also be installed on the rear roof to improve natural light.A community council is among objectors to the move.Michael Tomlinson, of Burgh Road, has hit out against the plan on behalf of Prestwick North Community Council.His objection claimed changes would lead to an “unwelcome overdevelopment and intensication of an already intensively developed establishment.”An objection from George Wallace said: “I am the adjacent building owner and am unhappy about the close proximity of the new deli and toilet extension to my property.”A supporting statement from Buzzworks said: “We hope that the alterations to the building will add a signicant change to the internal layout of the venue adding new experiences for the customers and keeping the building fresh and up to date. There will be no increased public areas.” Troon Conservative councillor Peter Convery said: “It think it is a remarkable change. It will certainly enhance the town of Prestwick.”Prestwick and Conservative councillor Margaret Toner said she was delighted by the plan.She said: “I was always amused by the retractable roof.”"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council chiefs now","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council chiefs now refuse to call Station Hotel by its nameOfficials have begun referring to the B Listed pile as the “building adjacent to Ayr train station”.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsStation Hotel \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe famous Station Hotel in Ayr has had its name wiped from history – by bosses at South Ayrshire Council.

Perhaps a little too early for the jumpers, I attended the Memorial Hall eager to feast upon the much-anticipated performance of these young thespians.Could they really deliver this magical Christmas story and live up to the incredible reputation set by their mentors, Innerleithen  District Amateur Operatic Society  You bet your bottom dollar they did!From the moment the music started and the curtain opened on this stunning production, I along with the audiences were captivated.Playing the hopeful orphan was Freya Wilson. She already looked the part with red hair and freckles, and with stunning vocals she belted out classics lsquoTomorrowrsquo and lsquoMaybersquo, which I have no doubt produced a few tears from the audience. She embraced the character with her cheeky charm and wit, and carried out the role of the ever-optimistic character beautully.Hatching a plan to escape the orphanage and find her parents, Annie is helped by her urchin friends, who had the crowdrsquos toes-tapping and knees bouncing to a fantastically choreographed lsquoHard Knock Lersquo. Credit where itrsquos due, this incredible young cast, who reprised their roles as servants and New Yorkers, were amazing, bringing le to the entire show.But Anniersquos cunning plan to escape fails, and it isnrsquot long before she is dragged back to the evil clutches of the vile Miss Hannigan, played by Lizzie Bell. What was in the champagne bottle, I do not know, but the teenager stumbled about the stage, and conveyed the child-hating orphanage boss to comic perfection. Hanniganrsquos flirtatious manner with Officer Ward , who brings Annie back after running away, had the audience chuckling, and truly convinced us of her distaste for the girls in her care with a jaw-dropping performance of lsquoLittle Girlsrsquo.Anniersquos capture isnrsquot the end of her adventure, itrsquos only just begun, as she s in perfect time to meet Grace Farrell.Miss Farrell is gracefully played by the suave and sophisticated Ava Church, dressed impeccably as the rsquos private secretary to Oliver Warbucks. Annie cheekily seizes a golden opportunity to spend Christmas with Mr Warbucks, and is swept off to live the le of royalty at his mansion.Annie soon melts the heart of wealthy businessman Oliver Warbuckswho gave an endearing performance as the billionaire. The two gave a heart-warming rendition of lsquoI Donrsquot Need Anything But Yoursquo. This will be Thomasrsquos first and last performance with KIYT, but Irsquom sure it wonrsquot be last wersquoll see of this talented young man.After promising to help Annie find her parents, in step the villains of the show ndash scheming Rooster Hannigan and his ditzy blonde girlfriend Lily St Regis.Together with Miss Hannigan, the three plot to swindle Mr Warbucks out of a , dollar reward by posing as Anniersquos parents.Alex Paterson pulls off the flashy self-assured gangster brilliantly, and with his money-grabbing side-kick Lily St Regis, the two are perfectly paired bringing not only the comic element to the show, but impeccable American accents, which polished off their characters.Now at this point I must declare my motherly interest, as Lily was played by my daughter Neve Scott. It is very dficult for one to critic her own child. However, I am very proud to call her a vain, blonde bimbo, red-lipstick wearing, smoking, winey voiced, floozy!The three baddies gave a show-stopping performance of lsquoEasy Streetrsquo which had the audiences in stitches.True to the classic, their evil plotting is foiled and Annie has her happy ending after being adopted by Mr Warbucks. The whole cast came out in glorious chorus for the finale of lsquoTomorrowrsquo.There is one furry four-legged actor who deserves a mention for his tail-wagging performance, the adorable Harry who is no stranger to the spotlight after his dog debut as Toto in the Operarsquos lsquoThe Wizard of Ozrsquo. Stardom beckons for the pooch, whom Irsquom sure could be crowned a Peeblesshire Pet Idol in the future!Praise swept over social media for the young cast last week, leaving many hoping this will be the first of many shows by the talented KIYT cast.

It will be deal or no deal.I wonrsquot pretend the deal is perfect.No-one gets everything they want in a negotiation ndash and wersquove had two years of tough negotiations with the EU.So the deal is a compromise.If between now and the final vote in Parliament we learn the deal does not deliver everything wersquove promised our fishing industry, Irsquoll not be able to support it.And the same goes for Northern Ireland.I need to be sure the so-called backstop plan does not threaten the integrity of the UK by creating fundamentally dferent, permanent arrangements for Northern Ireland.But Irsquom encouraged those risks have been avoided because itrsquos clear the arrangements focus on the specic circumstances in Northern Ireland ndash the need to honour the Belfast Agreement and maintain the fragile peace process, and to avoid a hard border with Ireland. One thing I am absolutely certain about is this: a no deal Brexit would be a disaster for Scotland and the whole of the UK.It would harm the economy, threaten jobs and damage peoplersquos standards of living. I will do everything I can to stop that happening.Irsquove been disappointed by the soap opera of cabinet resignations over the past few days and Irsquom dismayed that colleagues might yet try to force a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister.That would be a huge distraction at the worst possible moment.It is time for MPs on all sides to recognise that the alternative to the deal we have negotiated is leaving the EU without a deal. I hope that nightmare prospect really focuses minds in the days ahead.There is nothing to stop the SNP and Labour backing the deal. It achieves key goals set out in their own Brexit plans, like protecting trade and citizensrsquo rights. However, to support their own political objectives, they currently plan to vote against the proposed agreement.Prime Minister Theresa May has shown resolve, determination and strength of character as we move towards the final, dficult stages of the Brexit process.

to campaign for a new high school in Hawick - ahead of both Galashiels and Selkirk.Westminster MP John Lamont and Holyrood MSP Rachael Hamilton have launched the campaign, which aims to bring about a new high school as soon as possible and unite the townrsquos politicians behind a united front.Scottish Borders Council launched a review of all educational facilities in the Borders in September , with a view to building new schools, assessing which schools may need to be merged or closed, and considering how appropriate current catchment areas are.Education bosses at the council are known to prefer an intergenerational model of education, such as the poundm campus at Jedburgh which will cater for - year olds and contain community spaces and a library.In April , Scottish Borders Council agreed to create inidualised plans for schools in Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Selkirk, and agreed to bring an update to the council in October.However, the update has so far failed to materialise leaving parents and students in the dark about the future of their school.John Lamont, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk in Westminster, said: ldquoHawick High School has had its fair share of publicity recently, but it is clear that hard working pupils and staff are being let down by a site which is simply not fit for purpose.ldquoThat is why I have joined with my colleague Rachael, to call on the townrsquos representatives to come together for the good of the town.ldquoGalashiels is already the front runner to get a new school, because the town and the community is united and has a clear plan.ldquoHawick is lucky to have very active local representatives who have already put in a lot of work in to securing a new school for the town.ldquoNow is the time for the community and for its representatives to come together to focus on delivering for Hawickrsquos pupils, teachers and parents.ldquoIf we argue amongst ourselves about details, the effect will be that Hawick is put to the back of the queue.Rachael Hamilton, who represents Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire in Holyrood, added: ldquoMaking a decision on a site would give pupils, teachers and parents a real boost.ldquoOther towns in the Borders have been fortunate to benefit from a new modern teaching and learning environment and Hawick is clearly in need of some investment.ldquoPolitical infighting wonrsquot help, clarity should be provided over such an important issue, this is about giving young people and future generations a place to be proud of.The townrsquos councillors have welcomed the intervention of the two politicians, and threw their weight behind the campaign.Councillor Stuart Marshall commented: ldquoI think itrsquos very important that all politicians, councillors and community leaders join forces to continue the campaign for a new high school.ldquoOf course funding such a project will be a major factor in whether we can deliver such a project, and itrsquos great that both our Westminster and Holyrood representatives in the area are throwing their weight behind such an initiative.ldquoLet us hope that between them they can come up with much of the finances required.Councillor Watson McAteer said: ldquoI am delighted that our local elected UK and Scottish Conservative politicians are throwing their weight and influence behind a new high school for Hawick.ldquoI am in complete agreement that politics should have no role in deciding the future of our children and by definition our town and the quicker this project is agreed by all the better.ldquoHawick High School has seen its fair share of problems and a new learning campus would go a long way to resolving existing and future problemsCouncillor David Paterson added: ldquoAll of the Hawick councillors are campaigning furiously to get a new high school for Hawick, and the councillors in other wards are shouting for their areas as well.ldquoIrsquod like John Lamont MP to encourage the Tory government to make more money available to the Scottish Government to make this into a reality.The proposals to create inidual plans for Galashiels, Hawick, Selkirk and Peebles came on the back of assessments of the four schools that found they all have what are described as major defects.The facilities at each school were graded from A to D, with A signying that the buildings are performing well and operating effectively and D indicating that the economic le of the facilities has expired and they are at risk of failure.The overall conditions of Galashiels Academy, Hawick

security services, a major new report has concluded.A number of shortcomings in the handling of Salman Abedi before he launched a suicide attack at a pop concert in May last year, killing  people, were detailed by Parliamentrsquos Intelligence and Security Committee .Abedi, , first came to the attention of MI in December  and was briefly investigated by the agency in .The ISC assessment said:ndash Abedi visited an extremist contact in prison on more than one occasion but no follow-up action was taken by either MI or policendash MI decided not to place travel monitoring or restrictions on Abedi, meaning he was allowed toundetected to the UK in the days before he carried out the attackndash MI systems moved too slowly after Abedirsquos case had been flagged for reviewndash Abedi was not at any point considered for a referral to the Prevent anti-terror scheme.ISC chairman Dominic Grieve said: ldquoWhat we can say is that there were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedirsquos case and, while it isimpossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed.Mr Grieve said it was ldquostriking how many of the issues which arose in relation to the attacks last year had previously been raised by the committee in its reports on the   attacks and the killing of Lee Rigby.The Conservative MP said: ldquoWe have previously made recommendations in all of these areas, yet the Government failed to act on them.He noted that both MI and counter-terror police have been ldquothorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes, adding: ldquoThe lessons from last yearrsquos tragic events must now result in real action.Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi The ISC, which has access to top-level security officials and classied material, reviewed the five attacks that hit Britain last year.In total  innocent people were killed. In addition to the Manchester fatalities, five victims died in the Westminster attack in March, eight at London Bridge in June, and one at Finsbury Park in the same month.Then in September, a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green, injuring  people.The events last year prompted intense scrutiny of Britainrsquos counter-terrorism apparatus after it emerged that in a number of cases, the perpetrators had previously appeared on the radar of agencies.Prior to his attack, Abedi had travelled to Libya.The ISC questioned the decision not to use travel monitoring and travel restriction capabilities in the case, adding: ldquoWe recognise that there still may not have been sufficient time to identy or act on his attack planning. It would, nevertheless, have provided more of an opportunity.Mr Grieve said: ldquoMI have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so, and they have now revisited their policies in this respect.The committee also said there appeared to have been ldquofundamental failings in the way police and the Home Office handled Parsons Green attacker Ahmed Hassan.But Mr Grieve said the case was not fully examined in the assessment because the Home Office failed to provide full evidence in time despite multiple requests.The report found that the system for regulating and reporting purchases of ingredients used to make explosives was ldquohopelessly out of date, and called on the business community to exert pressure on communications firms to stop their sites being used as a ldquosafe haven for terrorists.Security chiefs say they are operating at an unprecedented pace to head off the threat.Since March last year,  plots have been foiled, while police and MI are mounting a record -plus live investigations.There are around , active ldquosubjects of interest, plus more than , closed SOIs who have at some point featured in terrorism probes.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ldquoFollowing the attacks, the Government, police and MI undertook a series of rigorous reviews to ensure we are all doing everything we can to tackle the evolving threat of terrorism.ldquoAs a result, we have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information sharing with local authorities.ldquoWe are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their s.National head of counter-terror policing Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: ldquoWe would like to reassure the public that ever since the attacks of last year we have sought to learn from what happened before, during and afterwards, and improve our wider operating model and ways of managing and mitigating the risk from terrorism.ldquoWorking evermore closely with the security service and learning our lessons, we will do everything we can to reduce the chances of this happening again..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: MI  umissed opportunities to stop Manchester bomber u"},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish golf clubs champions evening","story":"Club Captain, Calum MacMillan, presented prizes to the winners and runners-up in all of the many competitions contested on both the Championship and the Pans courses.Calum also thanked the stalwarts of the club whose hard work and commitment made the night possible.He made special mention of the green-keeping staff led by new head green-keeper Craig Barr, and also of Jennie Dunn and her hard working staff at the professional shop.In the past  months they have encouraged every catagory of player, from the youngest to the late starters, to take up the sport and get involved at the club.Calum noted the excellent hospitality and food supplied by Iain and his team, not only on the night but throughout the whole year.The final thanks was reserved for the members themselves, without whose support there simply would not be a thriving golf club at Machrihanish.Calum added: #The winter leagues have now commenced and everyone is looking forward to the  season in earnest.#Championship course prizewinners : Monthly medals: March: Division : Donald Johnson,  Division : John Rennie, Division : Findlay Ross.

Visitors will be able to access it via a walkway.The plans were originally turned down after an objection from Transport Scotland, which felt it would ldquoresult in inappropriate parking which would interfere with the safety and free flow of traffic on the A.However, at the local review body meeting, three councillors disagreed and gave it the go-ahead.Among those approving the plans was ward councillor Norman Hampshire.

It is a collection of stories and anecdotes mainly relating to sporting le and animals.The following tale is inspired from one of the anecdotal stories in Eganrsquos book:ONE autumn evening in the early th century, a storm descended on the county. Dark clouds opened their dreich souls and drenched the land with a torrent of rain. The wind and downpour kept people awake for the whole night, and but by sunrise the tempest was over.Yet all the sudden rain had caused the River Tyne to flood. The folk of Haddington gathered by its banks to witness a strange sight. For the surface of the water was laid with huge masses of hay. The storm had obviously caused the hay recently cut and stacked in the fields upriver to be blown into the flood water, or swept away by it.They watched as small mountains of hay floated by. It was an intriguing sight but of course for farmers it was their winter feed for their animals going waste to the sea.Then someone spotted a swan. It seemed to be attempting to find a place to land. The river was in a torrent and at times the majestic creature seemed to give in to the current and glide on its course until once again it found the strength and motivation to make for the river bank. It was in no imminent danger, but clearly desired to get out of the fast-moving water.As people watched the swan it was noticed that a strange black spot could be seen amidst its white feathers. As the swan drted closer to the bank, people realised what the black spot was: a rat!The rat was clearly alive, at times peeping over the plumage asto see where they were. The swan seemed unperturbed by the ratrsquos presence on its back. In fact, as people watched more closely there seemed to be a connection between the swan and the rat which was most unusual.The royal bird was clearly giving the rat a collie-buckie, or piggy back. How the rat came to be on the swanrsquos back in the first place nobody could tell. The wee creature was very likely at home in one of the bales of hay when it was swept away by the river. In the swirling water it must have struggled to survive.Then rescue came with the swan. Could the creature have scrambled onto the swan without its permission  Surely not! Did the swan actively help the rat  If so, the moment of rescue had been a compassionate act unseen by human eyes. As people followed the drama they realised that the swan was looking for a place to land, not for itself but for its passenger.A crowd had soon gathered to witness the swanrsquos progress. The power of the flood water meant it had real dficulty in finding a place to get close to the river bank. But finally the swan found the strength and opportunity to swim close to the riverrsquos edge.The rat, recognising the opportunity, leaped from the swanrsquos plumage and landed safely on dry land. For an instant the rat turned and looked at the swan, then scampered away. The swan, its mission accomplished, majestically glided back into the main flow of the river.If the rat had thought itself safe then it soon realised this not to be the case. The people watching the spectacle had motivations very dferent to the swan. As soon as the rat landed, dozens of young men, urged on by their elders, chased it with sticks and set their dogs upon it.The animal, having survived naturersquos tempest, now faced an even greater danger his le was sport for humans. The creature zigzagged as people, yelling and howling with delight, chased it this way, then that. The rat, being cornered by a group of about  lads armed with stones and sticks, turned and headed back towards the water.But it didnrsquot make it. The creature was given a deadly blow by a lsquomerciless fellowrsquo. A cheer rang out and people came to view the dead rat. Then a strange silence descended as people reflected, now too late, on what had happened. In the frenzy of the chase it had been so easy to see the rat as merely vermin, rather than a living creature who had struggled to survive and so earned the right to le.People dispersed, no longer cheering.The whole scene had been witnessed by the swan from its vantage point on the river. What its thoughts were on the human behaviour it saw we can only guess.Humans can be made to do this to each other as well, of course. In the frenzy of war, people are encouraged to see others as no more worthy of le than that rat. And the insidious power of this is that both sides are encouraged to think the same way.But deep down, when we touch our humanity, we know how wrong this is. Old soldiers themselves are the first to understand the tragedy of it and see the humanity in those who had been on the lsquoother sidersquo. While there are undoubtedly people who commit evil and need to be stopped, it is the conditions which allow hate to flourish which give rise to their power and influence in the first place.In our remembrance of those who have fallen, let us do so with the reflection and not the frenzy. Let us not forget that the real enemy of us all is hate."},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors-impressed-on-visit-to-elphinstone-primary-school","story":"Parents of youngsters at Elphinstone Primary School and Nursery Class received a letter this week from Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate following an inspection visit in September.The letter outlined a number of strengths at the school, as well as areas to improve.Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, told the Courier: ldquoWe are pleased that inspectors from both agencies recognise the positive dference that nursery and primary school staff are making for the children and their families in Elphinstone.ldquoThey considered leadership, learning, attainment and wellbeing amongst other areas and concluded that the school was good across these quality indicators.ldquoIrsquom especially pleased to see Alison Cameron receive recognition for her leadership and direction so early in her time as headteacher of the school.ldquoI know that she and the staff team will continue to put pupilsrsquo learning at the heart of all they do.ldquoIrsquod also like to recognise Heather Williamsrsquo work in laying the foundations for this positive outcome during her time at Elphinstone.The letter noted strengths in the schoolrsquos work, including kind and articulate children who make the most of their learning, and the warm, inclusive ethos that creates a family feel.No further inspections are planned, with the school urged to ldquodevelop a strategic, joined-up approach to self-evaluation to ensure that all children can achieve the best possible outcomes and to continue to develop the curriculum.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokeswoman for education, echoed the comments of Mrs Robertson regarding the schoolrsquos former and current headteacher.She said: ldquoThe inspection recognised a number of areas such as the positive relationships across the nursery and school which are making a dference for children and families.ldquoThey also commented that children were making the most of their learning and were provided with real leadership opportunities at the school."},{"url":null,"title":"austerity-over-in-the-county-definitely-not","story":"Jim Lamond, head of East Lothian Council resources, dismissed claims austerity was coming to an end as a report warned of uncertainty about the future of farming, food and drink, and tourism after the UK left the European Union .Audit Scotland identied the potential problems facing East Lothian as the key sectors of its economy came under risk.

We had just popped in to get a few simple items, but I ended up with a very upset wee boy. The supermarket had already begun to display toys. My son had noticed them immediately because they had been deliberately placed at his level.I eventually managed to distract him and we made it out without a major meltdown, but it just highlighted to me the pressures we are all put under.I kept on saying to my son: ldquoNo, but maybe for Christmas.It was a tactic to get some immediate peace, but I realised I was building up expectations that Christmas is the time when all the accumulated desires for stuff are met.We are made to feel that the value of Christmas is measured in the amount of stuff we acquire or give. I hate this and reject it but I am by no means immune from its pressure. I am made to feel guilty and every year I give in some way or another.The psychological warfare in our minds has already begun. The new toys laid out in that supermarket was but the opening shot. Soon a lsquoChristmassyrsquo atmosphere will engulf us as we do our shopping, designed to press our internal panic button that we need get on with buying lots of stuff, like a stressed squirrel collecting nuts for the winter.I know Irsquove ranted about this before but in February I spoke to a group of vulnerable parents in a course I was delivering. Many had huge debts yet had spent literally hundreds of pounds on Christmas presents, most of which were by this time broken, forgotten about or discarded.One of the parents encapsulated it perfectly: ldquoThe trouble is itrsquos easy to realise after itrsquos all over that yoursquove gone overboard, but the pressure is so hard to resist before Christmas. Yoursquore made to feel that you are a bad parent or a failureyou donrsquot get all that stuff. Itrsquos everywhere you go and on the screens. Itrsquos impossible to escape from it.In the discussion the parents said they wished there was a course or some guidance on how to resist the pressure while still making Christmas special for their kids.In a sense, this issue is not just a Christmas one, although the consumerist pressure is at its most intense in the run-up to Christmas, and even immediately afterwards with the sales. We have literally been sold the idea that buying stuff is what defines us.It has been a conscious, deliberate and sustained ideological assault on us and our children.In her brilliant film The Story of Stuff, Annie Leonard gives a quote from a retail analyst Victor Lebow: ldquoOur enormously productive economy. . . demands that we make consumption our way of le, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption. We need things, consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.While this was in reference to the USA a number of years ago, it holds true for us here and now.Christmas, as well as other seasonal festivals, have been made a festival of buying stuff.Itrsquos destroying the very planet we live on, it piles our homes with unneeded and soon-to-be discarded consumerist items .Meanwhile, more and more of us are time poor and running about to pay for things we soon forget we even bought and are likely already in the dump or charity shop.I was once told I was being a Scrooge when I spoke of this issue. But the message in Scrooge, when he realises whatrsquos important, is that he gives his employee time off to be with his family, and a pay rise so they can eat he shows kindness and shares a meal and social time with his family. Itrsquos not about tons of stuff.Our time together is the most valuable and valued thing we will ever have. Irsquod never say donrsquot buy presents, as I know a thoughtful present is a wonderful thing. Butitrsquos lost in a sea of other stuff then its signicance is lost too.What I think is important is doing things together and measuring the value of gts by the thought put into them, rather than the price or quantity of them. And there are a host of local Christmas fairs taking place in schools and community halls all over East Lothian where many local craftspeople, artists and others will be selling locally produced and environmentally friendly gts which have real value and are designed to last. It seems to me this is the best place to take our custom.I know this has not been a proper story but, then again, in a sense it is. Itrsquos the story of how our rituals and the meanings of our lives have been turned into market value, and we now often feel powerless or unable to step out of it without feeling guilty, inadequate or ldquoa Scrooge.Thatrsquos how I feel every Christmas but Irsquom going to make a Herculean effort this year to practice what I preach. Irsquom not rejecting that lsquoChristmassyrsquo feeling or refusing to buy presents. But Irsquom defining it on my own terms, or at least Irsquoll try. Itrsquos about my time with people I value. Itrsquos about putting in thought rather than looking at the price tag.Itrsquos also about understanding how terribly dficult Christmas is for so many people and finding ways to connect with them and show them some kindness and inclusion.Maybe itrsquos just me, but I think that is one of the best gts you can give your children and others you love."},{"url":null,"title":"great-grandmother-84-enjoys-microlight-flight","story":"Jenny Lyall, , was the passenger in a microlight, taking off from East Fortune Airfield, earlier this month.The small aircraft, piloted by Kim Ritchie, gave Jenny the chance to look over her home in Haddington.Clients at the townrsquos day centre, managed by Caroline Scott, have been outlining things they would like to do, from having a holiday in the spring to going on the London Eye.For Jenny, though, it was a chance to take to the skies.She said: ldquoIrsquove always watched the microlights going over and would be sitting in the garden saying: lsquoI quite fancy doing that.rsquoldquoWhen Caroline askedthere was anything anybody would like to do I said I would like to go up in a microlight.A few days later Jenny received a phone call telling her there was a surprise for her at the day centre and she said she was thrilled when she found out that was a microlight flight, adding: ldquoI thoroughly enjoyed it ndash I would do it again tomorrow.ldquoNot bad for an -year-old!Caroline was delighted to be able to help.

launched a suicide attack at a pop concert in May last year, killing  people, were detailed by Parliamentrsquos Intelligence and Security Committee .Abedi, , first came to the attention of MI in December  and was briefly investigated by the agency in .The ISC assessment said:ndash Abedi visited an extremist contact in prison on more than one occasion but no follow-up action was taken by either MI or policendash MI decided not to place travel monitoring or restrictions on Abedi, meaning he was allowed toundetected to the UK in the days before he carried out the attackndash MI systems moved too slowly after Abedirsquos case had been flagged for reviewndash Abedi was not at any point considered for a referral to the Prevent anti-terror scheme.ISC chairman Dominic Grieve said: ldquoWhat we can say is that there were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedirsquos case and, while it isimpossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack, we

last year had previously been raised by the committee in its reports on the   attacks and the killing of Lee Rigby.The Conservative MP said: ldquoWe have previously made recommendations in all of these areas, yet the Government failed to act on them.He noted that both MI and counter-terror police have been ldquothorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes, adding: ldquoThe lessons from last yearrsquos tragic events must now result in real action.The ISC, which has access to top-level security officials and classied material, reviewed the five attacks that hit Britain last year.In total  innocent people were killed. In addition to the Manchester fatalities, five victims died in the Westminster attack in March, eight at London Bridge in June, and one at Finsbury Park in the same month.Then in September, a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green, injuring  people.The events last year prompted intense scrutiny of Britainrsquos counter-terrorism apparatus after it emerged that in a number of cases, the perpetrators had previously appeared on the radar of agencies.Prior to his attack, Abedi had travelled to Libya.The ISC questioned the decision not to use travel monitoring and travel restriction capabilities in the case, adding: ldquoWe recognise that there still may not have been sufficient time to identy or act on his attack planning. It would, nevertheless, have provided more of an opportunity.Mr Grieve said: ldquoMI have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so, and they have now revisited their policies in this respect.The committee also said there appeared to have been ldquofundamental failings in the way police and the Home Office handled Parsons Green attacker Ahmed Hassan.But Mr Grieve said the case was not fully examined in the assessment because the Home Office failed to provide full evidence in time despite multiple requests.The report found that the system for regulating and reporting purchases of ingredients used to make explosives was ldquohopelessly out of date, and called on the business community to exert pressure on communications firms to stop their sites being used as a ldquosafe haven for terrorists.Security chiefs say they are operating at an unprecedented pace to head off the threat.Since March last year,  plots have been foiled, while police and MI are mounting a record -plus live investigations.There are around , active ldquosubjects of interest, plus more than , closed SOIs who have at some point featured in terrorism probes.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ldquoFollowing the attacks, the Government, police and MI undertook a series of rigorous reviews to ensure we are all doing everything we can to tackle the evolving threat of terrorism.ldquoAs a result, we have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information sharing with local authorities.ldquoWe are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their s.National head of counter-terror policing Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: ldquoWe would like to reassure the public that ever since the attacks of last year we have sought to learn from what happened before, during and afterwards, and improve our wider operating model and ways of managing and mitigating the risk from terrorism.ldquoWorking evermore closely with the security service and learning our lessons, we will do everything we can to reduce the chances of this happening again."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/6969098.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"revealed-number-of-scots-who-would-vote-to-remain-in-uk-in-new-referendum","story":"The Survation poll on behalf of a pro-union group asked a dferent question from that put to voters in the  independence referendum.Instead of askingthe country should be independent, it asked whether they would like to remain as part of the UK.Results also show % of Yes voters in  would back Remain, while % of former No voters would choose to Leave.        name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.pushPamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: \"This bombshell poll shows that a huge majority of Scots want to remain in the UK and are turned off by Nicola Sturgeons desperate attempts to use Brexit to break up Britain.\"Voters know that we are better off as part of the UK and it makes sense to remain with our oldest friends, neighbours and allies - rather than ide us in the name of nationalism.\"The Survation poll of , people aged over  in Scotland asked how they would vote in a second independence referendum, with the question \"should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the UK \"It was carried out between November  and .Results show those choosing to remain would drop to % without a Brexit agreement.The poll reports % of Scots are either less likely to back independence as a result of Brexit, or no more or less likely.It also found that % would choose to stay in the EU.The SNP came out with % in the survey when asked about voting in a general election, while the Scottish Conservatives were second with %.SNP depute leader Keith Brown said: \"It seems this poll was commissioned by our opponents to land a political blow on the SNP, whereas its had the exact opposite effect.\"These figures make extremely encouraging reading for the independence movement, while leaving the Tory and Labour parties extremely downhearted.\"Its a spectacular boomerang attack.\"With crucial days ahead as we hurtle towards Brexit, the SNP will continue to stand up to the Tories and fight for whats best for Scotlands future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"five-not-to-be-missed-christmas-events-all-within-driving-distance-from-glasgow","story":"As the most wonderful time of the year snowballs towards us, VisitLanarkshire has revealed its top five events, guaranteed to get our readers in the festive spirit:.

Democracy demands that members of an international trading organisation should have have a share in the decision-making process. This is where the Withdrawal Agreement, indeed the whole Brexit project falls down, because as things stand, we dont. We will be rule takers.Theresa May realised very early on that the economic cost of leaving the EU completely was just too high. She gave assurances to all those big international companies like Nissan, Siemens and Rolls Royce, who have complex, just-in-time supply chains, that she would negotiate a deal that was at least as good as the single market. She effectively promised no tarfs, border checks or regulatory issues ndash ie no ldquofriction - between Britain and the EU. She had to, or theyd have upped and left . Components for Vauxhall cars are said to cross and recross EU borders at least  times before theyre finally assembled in Ellesmere Port.But removing tarf and non-tarf barriers is precisely what the Customs Union and the European Single Market were originally created to do. The EU is first of all a free trade area, the most comprehensive in the world. When Britain decided to leave, it meant that frictions would inevitably . Theresa May has been trying to square the circle ever since: getting the benefits of a single market without being in it.Shes achieved quite a lot, to give her credit. Under her orce deal, Britain gets broad access in to the single market in goods without having to accept free movement. But the cost was always going to be some continued observance of the EUrsquos regulations, plus ECJ oversight. Weve had to agree to ldquodynamic alignment with EU regulations, meaning that when they change in future Britain will have to go along with the new rules.The obvious solution might be to just join the single market, as Norway did after . It is not in the EU, the Common Fisheries Policy or the Common Agricultural Policy. This is Nicola Sturgeons preferred option, and she said last week thatScotland even got the same deal as Northern Ireland, which is to remain largely in the ESM, she would vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. But while this Norway option has worked after a fashion, it has powerful critics. It costs quite a lot, and there have long been complaints in Oslo about ldquofax democracy - that new laws are simply faxedfrom Brussels. But hey ndash thats just how these things work. You are either in the EU or you arent.So what happens now  Mays deal wont fly, yet she stands her ground. The deal will almost certainly be rejected in parliament, even though Labour dont really have a coherent alternative. Jeremy Corbyn was scathing about Mayrsquos ldquobotched deal, but he too wants to leave the EU. Nor do Labour wish Britain to be a formal member of the Customs Union or the European Single Market. John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, says he would renegotiate the deal to achieve a ldquoclose and collaborative relationship with the single market. In other words, a better deal than Mayrsquos. But the German Chancellor, Angela Merkell, has made clear that negotiations are over. End of story.Faced with a disastrous no deal, and no prospect of renegotiating the Withdrawal Agreement, the opposition parties face a very hard parliamentary choice next month. Do they join with Jacob Rees Mogg and the DUP, and vote for an economic disaster which would damage the livelihoods of countless Labour voters  Or do they suck it up, back Theresa May and then blame the Tories in future for landing Britain with such a bad settlement  If they vote down Mayrsquos orce deal, they must know that renegotiation is not now an option. Nor is a general election, because the Tories wonrsquot vote, like turkeys, for an early Christmas. The only alternative is for the opposition parties to do what they should have done months ago: unite the Remain majority in the House of Commons to demand a delay on Article , and then force May to hold a repeat referendum.If parliament cant decide what to do, the only option is to hand it back to the people who got us into this mess in the first place: the voters."},{"url":null,"title":"the-cool-list-hotels","story":"Built in  by Lord MacDonald of Sleat and once surrounded by orange trees ndash hence the hotelrsquos name ndash Marmalade is a -minute walk from Portree harbour and offers fine views over Portree Bay and to the Cuillins beyond.

While we have good evidence about how vigorous exercise affects our health, little is known about this disappearing background of daily light activity.The study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, showed that light activity dramatically reduces the risk of premature death, even after accounting for levels of moderate to vigorous activity and other factors such as smoking.The researchers also found that moving around can help people control their blood sugar and is particularly beneficial for people with Type  diabetes. When a person interrupted sitting with a few minutes of light activity such as slow walking, it reduced blood sugar and insulin levels by  to  percent on average. People with type  diabetes had even greater benefits.Dr Naveed Sattar, Professor of Cardiovascular  Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow carried out a randomised study into the metabolic effects of breaking prolongued sitting in older people, which is associated with insulin resistance and poor cardiometabolic health. He found that walking breaks of five minutes every  minutes after meals lowered insulin and blood pressure but standing breaks did not improve the outcome.:House of Cards review: Netflix replace stench of seedy bloke with uber lsquowokersquoldquoItrsquos simple physics ndashyou walk after a meal, you burn calories that would otherwise stay in the blood.

Most activities that used to involve moving are now geared to sitting down ndash whether itrsquos transport or how we work and spend our free time ndash and that is having a detrimental effect on health.His message is to ldquomove as much as you can ndash the more the better. He recommends getting up to talk to people at work instead of sending emails, more standing or walking meetings, taking the stairs, walking to the local shops, and putting an alert on your computer every  minutes to get up and walk around.ldquoAnd stop binge-watching on-demand television series for hours from the sofa.

And, we dont know what the outcome of that will be.\"During PMQs, Mrs May clashed with Jeremy Corbyn, who branded her Brexit plan a ldquofailure, saying: \"Instead of giving confidence to the millions of people who voted both Leave and Remain, this half-baked deal fails to give any hope that it can bring the country together again.\"Isnt it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal andthe Government cant negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.\"The PM hit back, saying: \"He is opposing a deal he hasnt read, hes promising a deal he cant negotiate, hes telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever he will do, I will act in the national interest.\"Later, Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, accused Mrs Mayrsquos Government of being in ldquochaos and confusion and said it was extraordinary the SNP was able to get its amendments to the Finance Bill through without a vote because the Democratic Unionists had failed to supply support to the Conservatives.ldquoIt shows the Government is running scared and there is a sense of panic, declared the Highland MP.Mr Corbynrsquos spokesman accused the Government of being ldquoin disarray, saying: ldquoItrsquos clear itrsquos unable to deliver a deal that has the confidence of Parliament or the country.Elsewhere, Mrs May got a boost when NFU Scotland came out in favour of her withdrawal plan.Andrew McCornick, the bodyrsquos President, said while the PMrsquos plan was ldquonot perfect, it would ensure there were ldquono hard barriers on the day we leave the EU and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.A UK Government spokesman welcomed the unionrsquos support and urged the Scottish Government ldquoto do the same, adding: ldquoThe deal will allow for the UKrsquos smooth and orderly exit from the EU and it works for the whole of the UK, including Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/283155.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-watchdog-calls-for-calorie-cap-to-make-food-on-the-go-healthier","story":"The nations food standards watchdog has made the suggestion as it examines ways to get the public to eatmore healthily.Food Standards Scotland also makes a case for a cut in takeaway portion sizes across high calorie offerings from so-called out of home outlets ndash including restaurants, cafes, pubs, takeaway and delivery firms as part of a package of proposals.An FSS consultation document makes suggestions that caterers, retailers, manufactures and businesses who supply food could adopt including applying maximum calorie limits and redesigning menus to exclude very high calorie menu items.It also says there may be a case for mandatory rather than voluntary calorie labelling and that new standards should be developed for providing full nutritional information.It charts a range of menu items from pizzas, burgers, cakes and pastries to fish suppers, cooked breakfasts and even cinema popcorn where there was \"considerable scope\" for cutting calories by reducing portion size and changing recipes to cut fats and sugars and increase fruit, vegetable and fibre content.Evidence showed that food purchased outside the home was skewed towards less healthy choices and that large portion sizes, excess fats, added sugars and insufficient fruits and vegetables all contribute to the problem, FSS said.A recent survey of a sample of chips shops in Glasgow showed the average portion of chips was close to  calories, \"indicating very large portions\".An FSS consultation document suggests measures caterers, retailers, manufactures and businesses who supply food could adopt including applying maximum calorie limits and redesigning menus to exclude very high calorie menu items.FSS said said businesses should also make small or half portions of standard menu items widely available and said nutritional information should be available on all food eaten outside the home.Ross Finnie, the FSS chairman said: \"You cant have a calorie cap unless you have calculated the calories.\"We do have to have to address the issue of having calories clearly calculated, then we are saying is there a possibility of having a calorie cap and again we would have to discuss with government how it would enforce that.\"But I would very much rather that in an extensive consultation we get agreement in the industry and public side that this is one of the sectors where we need to make a big change, and franklywe made it voluntary, it would make it a heck of a lot easier.\"#It has been estimated that only a quarter of out of home businesses currently provide calorie labelling at the point of choice. This contrasted starkly with the near universal provision of calorie and nutrient information on pre-packaged products available in retail outlets.FSS also suggests using greater promotion and marketing to encourage consumers to choose healthier options and said it would be encouraging food businesses to take their own voluntary measures to change their promotion and marketing practices.\"Caterers, manufacturers and businesses who supply food for the catering industry all have a role in reducing calories and resetting the norms away from excessive consumption,\" said the FSS. It said that food outside the home could be improved by businesses dropping practices that encourage overeating while postively marketing and promoting fruit and vegetables.There are , restaurants, supermarkets, takeaways and food delivery services who sell food on-the-go in Scotland. Approximately half of so-called out of home visits in Scotland are made to branded businesses and half are made to independent businesses.Ross FinnieChips, cakes and pastries, specialty coffees and sugary soft drinks are among the top foods and drinks purchased outside the home.The FSS said that given the high calorie content of these types of foods, there is a need to \"rebalance the out of home offering towards more nutritious lower calorie menu options\".Obesity and diet related ill health is one of Scotlandrsquos biggest health concerns, costing around pound. bn every year.FSS says that with two thirds of adults in Scotland already overweight or obese, the health consequences of a poor diet are \"already very real\" and they impact the nationrsquos economy and productivity.It is estimated that up to a quarter of our calories may come from eating outside the home and the FSS says \"it is important that the out of home sector plays its part to improve the Scottish diet\".Mr Finnie added: \"Given that this sector is projected to grow, change is needed now to make out of home food and drink healthier. Clear calorie labelling is also crucial to enable consumers to make informed choices about the food they buy and eat outside the home.\"Responses to the FSS consultation will be used to guide the development of an overarching Out of Home Strategy for consideration by the FSS Board, with recommendations being provided to Scottish ministers next year."},{"url":null,"title":"hannah-bardell-refuses-to-apologise-after-being-shown-red-card-for-playing-football-in-commons","story":"John Bercow reprimanded the Livingston MP and some of her team-mates, who were kitted out in football jerseys, saying the \"historic\" chamber should not be used for a kick-about, adding he had received \"fulsome\" letters of apology from three of the five MPs involved.In a Commons statement, he told MPs: \"It has been brought to my attention that some football skills were displayed in the chamber yesterday evening after the House rose.\"I am informed that the doorkeepers on duty told the members concerned that the chamber was not the place for this activity. However, those doorkeepers were advised that permission had been given.

A spokesman noted how last week the PM had said thatMPs voted down her deal, ldquonobody can know for sure the consequences that will flow from that it would be to take a path of deep and grave uncertainty.But when it was pointed out Mrs May had given Ms McVey an assurance on leaving the EU, the spokesman replied: ldquoThe PM is determined she is going to ensure that we leave the EU on March , which is what the British people voted for.Hang on. Ms Rudd said a no-deal was not possible and Mrs May said there could be no BrexitMPs rejected her deal, so how could she say for certain the UK would leave the EU next March  No  simply repeated how the PM was determined to get her deal through ndash and that was that.Of course, one of the many complicating factors in this game of D political chess is that the Democratic Unionists, whose  MPs prop up the minority Tory Government, are in a huff over the withdrawal plan, believing it sets out the path to the break-up of the UK.Earlier this week, Mrs May and her colleagues had the humiliation of a seeing the DUP vote against part of the Finance Bill and b accepting opposition amendments for fearthey went to a vote, they would be voted down thanks to Nigel Dodds and his chums.No , in another show of bravado, insisted the so-called confidence and supply deal with the DUP, was \"intact\". Another insider declared: ldquoIrsquom not aware of any change to its status, noting how the DUP itself had said it was still alive.Hang on. The DUP are breaching the deal by voting against the Government. But the spokesman noted how it was only one vote and ldquowe won it by five votes.Askedthe PM could rely on the DUP, he replied: ldquoI have given you my answer.Earlier during a less-than-easy PMQs Mrs May had to face hostile questions not only from Jeremy Corbyn and Ian Blackford but also from some of her own MPs, urging her to change tack.One Tory backbencher suggested that her withdrawal plan would threaten the integrity of the UK, at which the DUPrsquos Mr Dodds was nodding vigorously.The Belfast North MP noted how, in the December joint UK-EU report, it was agreed Northern Ireland would have the ldquofinal say on whether it erged from the UK single market, the so-called ldquoStormont lock, but this bit had been deleted from the draft withdrawal agreement.Mrs May replied that the matter of regulations was for Westminster and, anyhow, Stormont had not sat for two years.Hang on. So why put the Stormont lock in the December report anyway The No  spokesman, also noting how Stormont was not currently in existence, said he had ldquonothing more to add.So, following a bruising PMQs, Mrs May set off for Brussels for talks with Jean-Claude Juncker to try to finalise the so-called future framework that will set out Britainrsquos future relationship with the EU post-Brexit.But things did not seem to be going smoothly. Surprise surprise.One senior German diplomat warned: ldquoIt needs to be finalised or Merkel will not attend. We do not want changes to the text making it even harder for May to agree with.The PM finally emerged from her tea and croissants to say further progress had been made but she would be going back to Brussels for more talks on Saturday, just hours before the planned Sunday summit.So things will, as many predicted, go to the wire and, of course, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.As Alice would say the Brexit process is getting curiouser and curiouser."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-the-future-for-renewables-has-to-be-large-scale-offshore-wind","story":"The future is offshore. Norway, for example has few land-based turbines ndash in September I drove theof Norway from Larvik to Tromso and recall seeing only one wind farm, well away from people and their magnicent wild landscapes. The Norwegians build their wind farms offshore, where the smooth, laminar flow of wind allows the turbines to operate at maximum efficiency, unlike their poor relations on the Scottish mainland.Anyone in the Scottish renewables industry will confirm that offshore is the future ndash today all the necessary knowledge and skills are available and, with costs falling with every offshore turbine, there is no need for further onshore development. The MW turbines in the Beatrice Field off the Caithness coast have been put in place on time and on budget. Already a  MW turbine is under development for future deployment. Large-scale onshore wind is yesterdayrsquos technology, only pursued by commercial companies chasing public subsidy while bribing local communities to support their planning applications.Now we need to identy those parts of Scotland dominated by large-scale wind farms so that visitors can recognise those areas to avoidthey want a hill walk without turbines. I look forward to the day when Visitscotland produces its ldquono-go areas brochure in a desperate attempt to kid the rest of the world that Scotland still is a magnicent country to come to for unspoilt natural beauty.Dave Morris, Bishop Terrace,Kinnesswood, Kinross.SOME years ago rural folk were slightly ldquocomfortedby the assurance that wind turbines would be in their communities for a generation only, until the subsidies ran out. Then sites would be decommissioned and operators would pay for the clean-up. Most were not naiumlve enough to believe that would necessarily happen or the thousands of tonnes of concrete and steel in the bases would be removed or the miles of access tracks would ever disappear but the turbines would go. ldquoTemporary was the word used and some were, no doubt, convinced industrial wind might be a necessary evil as a stepping stone to more reliable generation. Maybe they didnrsquot object to developments because they believed what the SNP administration was telling them.Then we started to see the words ldquoin perpetuity and realised that wind turbine installations may well be there forever.Now the watch word is ldquore-powering and even bigger turbines are to be placed on existing sites.Those that are to be re-powered, and it can only be the most recent approvals, must have full ecological surveys done as existing turbine bases will not be in the right place for these signicantly larger machines. They will also have greater visual impact and be potentially noisier.They must be treated as new applications with full planning fees paid.Why should we bankroll this industry any more than we do already  If they fail in any area the wind farm must be decommissioned.To do anything less confirms that we were quite simply lied to and it should be challenged.I would also askan increase in size of turbine mean more subsidiesthe original contracts have not run out  If so that is another cost that will burden the consumer.Lyndsey Ward,Darach Brae,Beauly.THE suspiciously precise figure of . tons of CO to build and install a ldquotypical wind turbine is quoted by George Herraghty , without any reference to the hundreds of tonnes of CO that a gas-fired power station might generate per hour. The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology reports letime gas-fired power stations emissions equivalent to -g of CO per kWh, and offshore wind at -g.If we are to reduce green subsidies, then we must tax fossil fuels more. If the Scottish Tories contend that the oil price has fallen too far for Scotland to pay for itself, their Westminster Government should have plenty of room to raise some taxes on petrol to compensate. Yet petrol duty has remained frozen since .AndIan Moirwants a plan to grow the economy, may I suggest we start by rebuilding maybe three per cent of Scotlandrsquos housing stock each year to a passive heating standard Alan Ritchie, Waverley Street,Glasgow.NOT for the first time you have printed a letter from Ian Moirin which he produces his quite fantastical electricity generation figures and his ridiculous consequential financial implications for Scotland.He states lsquorsquo to phase out TWh of gas, implying that this has been done by the Scottish Government.In fact TWh is about five times the annual demand for electricity in Scotland, and would require about ,MWs of gas capacity working at an annual load factor of  per cent ndash about  large gas fired power stations. Where were these stations And could I point out to Mr Moir that the Scottish Government has not ldquophased out a single MW of capacity as, a all generating plant in Great Britain is privately owned, and b energy policy is reserved to Westminster.On the back of his above fantasy figure of TWhs Mr Moir then computes that the dference between his assumed p unit figure for gas and his assumed p unit for renewables produces a figure of pound billion year. Actually that piece of arithmetic is correct. But for some reason he somehow thinks that this translates into a poundbn annual hit to Scotlandrsquos public services, which will be a surprise to anyone with a knowledge of our public finances.Nick Dekker, Nairn Way,Cumbernauld."},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-id-be-lying-if-i-said-older-generation-are-naturally-more-truthful-than-youngsters","story":"Studies suggest that those over  find it harder to lie.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118144.jpg","title":"Writings on the wall for Graffito","story":"THURSO has embraced an artistic legacy stretching back to the s with a vibrant mural in the town centre created last Wednesday by an artist from the Black Isle.Unlike the earlier work on Tollemache House by Polish artist Caziel Zielenkiewicz ndash a student of Picasso ndash the latest piece of public art has so far achieved great praise from the majority of people commenting on social media.The Facebook page for Caithness Horizons Museum and Art Galleryndash who commissioned the work by Marc Delaye ndash has attracted many comments about the colourful artwork gracing a wall of their carpark.Lora Dillon said: \"Went down to see it today. We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : amPolice in Orkney are appealing for information which could help trace Casey Scott who has been reported missing.

Albyn Housing is asking them to pay a lot more each month in some cases.The concerns were echoed by the MP Mr Blackford who said ldquofor quite a while now, he has been working with the CAB to get to bottom of ldquowhat I would generously describe as curious practices from Albyn Housing.He added: ldquoIn one case an Albyn Housing client who had just undertaken a tenancy was immediately sent a letter informing her rent was already in arrears.ldquoIn effect, they are asking for a payment arrangement in view that it is a debt, and extra payment is, therefore, being requested each month.ldquoI am sure as a charitable organisation Albyn Housing has their tenantsrsquo best wishes at heart, however, their recent practices raise many questions.ldquoThese must be reviewed to ensure that no additional hardship is being brought upon the people who take up a tenancy with them.In response, Calum Macaulay, chief executive at Albyn Housing Society, insisted his rent due date had not changed and said his organisation followed the statutory form of tenancy laid out by the Scottish Government in the HousingAct  ldquowhich states that rent is due on, or before, the first day of the month, paid in arrears.He went on: ldquoTenants claiming housing benefit previously had their rent paid directly to Albyn Housing.ldquoWe were always made aware that the payment was due, and as such, any arrears would be treated as technical.ldquoNow, with universal credit, the tenant is responsible for paying their rent direct. The society has no dealings with the DWP and we are not made aware of incoming housing payments. This means that all tenants, regardless of whether they are claiming universal credit or not, are required to pay their rent in accordance with their tenancy agreement.He said housing officers would be ldquomore than willing to help tenants make arrangements that work for them.It comes weeks after Albyn Housing had to apologise to a vulnerable tenant in Inverness after a boiler check bungle ended up leaving the single mum locked out of her flat for the night with her toddler daughter and having to rely on social workers to pay for emergency accommodation.Thursday  Nov  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Indeed, Kim Jong Yang’s appointment was described by one lawyer as a “solid, uncontroversial choice”.However, the reason why the election took place at all and what nearly happened are deeply alarming signs of how close we are to a new world order in which democracy, the rule of law and basic human rights no longer hold sway.The vacancy arose after the previous Interpol president, Meng Hongwei, disappeared in his native China. The authorities later said he was suspected of taking bribes, a claim his we denies, saying he is the victim of a vendetta by rivals in China’s security ministry. Such disappearances are not uncommon in China. Earlier this year, actress Fan Bingbing, star of the X-Men and Iron Man films, vanished for months before eventually surfacing to apologise for failing to pay her taxes.: Russia loses Interpol presidency vote as South Korean is electedJustice in China does not involve the idea that it must be seen to be done, leading to the well-founded suspicion that China’s leaders use state powers to silence critics. Kim’s election was also something of a surprise. The favourite was Alexander Prokopchuk, a former Russian interior ministry official. Businessman Bill Browder – whose lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was allegedly tortured and killed in a Moscow prison after investigating alleged corruption involving Kremlin-linked figures – had warned that Prokopchuk would take his instructions from Vladimir Putin, pointing out that Russia carried out Salisbury chemical weapons attack, has interfered in democratic elections in the US and Europe, and that a Russian missile was used to shoot down a passenger plane over Ukraine.: British academic jailed for le over spying allegations in UAEDonald Trump’s response to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi embassy – Trump said the Saudi royal family promised to spend billions on US arms – was another sign of how the rule of law is being diminished. All this sends out strong messages to elected leaders who look enviously at Putin’s corruption of democracy and to straightforward tyrants like the Saudi Crown Prince: democracy is falling, might is right, and murdering or disappearing a rival won’t have many repercussions. Interpol, already abused by non-democratic states, narrowly avoided being taken over by a deeply sinister regime.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

SIC has a poor record of flag flying in my opinion from the senior flagstaff. It#s the UK government#sand Scottish Parliaments policy to encourage councils to fly the Union Flagon a regular daily basis. It#s very rare to see a flag flying any time except on the Lord Lieutenants flag flying days list ofwhich is out of date.It is troubling to hear where the British media still blame German militarism and nationalism for WW, asnationalism and militarism were ever missing from the British national outlook. All major European powers fought to gain advantage over neighbours.It is refreshing though to hear the French President tell world leaders, including Putin and Trump, that nationalism is a #betrayal of patriotism#.#By saying #our interests first and never mind the others#, you stamp out the most precious thing a nation has # its moral values,# he said, thereby insisting these sometimes exist.The European Union used to be widely regarded as a moral endeavour. It seems most of our neighbours still see it that way, as something worthwhile which tempers selfish instincts and secures peace.If Brexit goes ahead the prospect of Britain forgetting its responsibilities as a victor, as Churchill put it in, #for the immediate future of the world# looms large. Let us hope some lessons can be recalled.#Patriotism is when the love of your own people comes first nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.# # Charles de GaulleSadly we see Donald Trump, #America First!, Let#s make America great again#. A nationalist doctrine of utter selfishness!We seem the same doctrine of the Alt-right gaining a foothold in the UK and Europe. Remember #The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing#,It is a sad reflection of the many, many people which has died due to war and conflict.There is one institute which promotes, encourages and sanctions war and conflict more so than any other establishment within a modern society.We have probably killed and maimed more people in the last  years than at any other time in  years. What has brought this to the fore is technology but also the institutes which have remained silent on such atrocities, this being the backbone of modern societies driven by economics, our banking systems.Never has there been so much money spent on war and conflict, never have so many countries been destroyed by war and conflict, and who stands by the sideline reaping in massive profits as a result, our banks.The Bible says # For the Love of Money is the Root to All Evils # never a truer word said with our modern banking systems.Rather sad that at a time when we remember those that saw the horror of so many European conflicts, we also saw the French and German leaders announce they want to create a #real# EU Army. I presume by #real# they mean, #the ability to kill people#. Not only was it tactless of Merkel and Macron, we surely have enough standing armed forces already in the world. Do we really need another Jane , I feel sure that Merkel and Macron were not thinking along the same lines as yourself .They stated the need for a ‘ real army’without any references to the huge revenues that could be gained from the manufacture of arms.It’s all very well trying to pass their claim off as being for the strength and safety of Europe but with no reference whatsoever to the economic   financial benefits which would bolster the banking strengths of Germany and France. What an oversight !!Too much sauerkraut and champagne probablyto blame.I wondertheir suggestion is in any way due to their much reduced popularity in their respective countries.I would have thought the present EU decision-making structure e.g. nations’ vetoes, is hopelessly incompatible with having its own military, capable of defending Europe against Russia, China and laughably, the US. How much will that cost  It will need massive further integration, possibly, to United States of Europe level , a ghastly spectre that motivated many Brexiteers to vote ‘Leave’. year more than the next seven countries put together at  billion dollars.To say that the E.U. should not work militarily together is preposterous.Europe has been ided by maniacs with delusions of grandeur,their own ego#s and agendas on too many occasions # the last fty years has brought us peace,economic stability and a continent able to feed itself.I am sure WinstonChurchillwould be very proud of that after the hell of World ,he fought like so many others for it and would be appalled at the prospect of Little Englanderism and the new Westminster faith with its no deal brexit nonsense!

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118338.jpg","title":"Helping mountain to reach its peak","story":"Gavin MusgroveA pound MILLION vision to revive CairnGorm Mountain has been laid out to release the resorts immense unlocked potential over the next five to  years.US-based consultancy SE Group believes the resort can attract in the region of , winter visitors per year ndash more in seasons when there are peak snow conditions ndash with the right targeted investments.But controversially they appear to have written-off any future for Coire na Ciste which accounts for one-third of the ski area and boasts the best terrain for skiers and boarders at intermediate level and beyond.Instead the report proposes that all the focus for snowsports is on Coire Cas and two state-of-the art six person chairlts should be installed.There is also a role for the funicular which is currently not running at the resort because of safety fears.However, it is seen as having a subsidiary role as snowsports uplt and to be used and maintained more for non-skiers and ski school customers.Vermont-based SE Group carried out its independent review of uplt infrastructure at the resort between February and September, earlier this year.No funding has been allocated.

It has to be through proper and proportionate channels that we bring this forward.\"She said Natural Retreats is the operator and part of the journey and had bought into it.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service. That support is urgently required."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-mod-gold-medals-e1539885405814.jpg","title":"thursday at the mod skye and lochalsh gold medal","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere was a Skye and Lochalsh double in the premier singing competition at this year’s National Mòd in Dunoon.In Wednesday night’s final Ceitidh Campbell from Kyle of Lochalsh won the women’s Gold Medal, while the men’s medal went to Ruairidh Cormack from Portree.Both singers are following in family footsteps in landing the prestigious honour, which is presented by Mòd organisers An Comunn Gàidhealach.Ceitidh’s mother, Barbara Smith, won the Gold Medal when the Mòd was held in Skye in .

November, in which Councillor Ian Cockburn put forward a motion whereby the local authority would determinefunds were available for design work to begin on replacement options to the bypass. This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27491  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe writer, newspaper editor and Irish republican Seumas O’Kelly was a native of Loughrea, County Galway. Author of short stories, plays, poems and a novel, The Weaver’s Grave which was his masterpiece, O’Kelly’s le was cut short because of his commitment to Irish freedom. The O’Kelly family of Loughrea were flour millers and merchants and Seumas received a good education. He was a fellow student of James Joyce in University College Dublin. There is a remarkable photograph of the BA degree class of  including Joyce, O’Kelly and George Clancy. Like O’Kelly, George Clancy, a close friend of Joyce, was to die a tragic death. He was Sinn Féin Mayor of Limerick when on  March  he was murdered in his home by the Black and Tans, on the same night as former Mayor Michael O’Callaghan. Seumas O’Kelly was a committed republican from an early age. He is recorded as one of those to the fore in the centenary commemorations of the  Rising in . He was writing for Arthur Grfith’s Irish Republican Brotherhood-funded newspaper The United Irishman from  and for its successor Sinn Féin from . While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare. He founded a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge in the town and was active in Sinn Féin locally. He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year. Several of his plays were produced at the Abbey Theatre. Constantly busy with literary and journalistic work, O’Kelly was subject to poor health. He joined Óglaigh na hÉireann when they were founded in  but was unable to play an active military role. His brother was a Volunteer and was jailed in England after the  Rising. The paper Nationality, edited by Grfith, was established in  and O’Kelly was one of its writers. It was the main organ of Sinn Féin during the  and  by-elections. In May  Grfith was arrested and jailed in England and O’Kelly took over as editor of Nationality. Following the  November  Armistice which ended the First World War, British soldiers and loyalists ran riot through the streets of Dublin, attacking suspected Sinn Féin supporters. On the night of  November a crowd of drunken soldiers invaded the Sinn Féin Ard Oig at  Harcourt Street . Seumas O’Kelly was at his desk in the Nationality office and tried to defend himself with his walking stick. The office was wrecked and O’Kelly collapsed. He was brought to Jervis Street Hospital where he died of a brain haemorrhage. Seumas O’Kelly was honoured with a republican funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery, attended by huge crowds.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1119684.jpg--.jpg?1540893420000\n","title":"christmas lights switch on date","story":"Ballymena Christmas light switch on is set for Thursday November , .The Mayor, Councillor Lindsay Millar, will turn on the lights, with a little help from the main man himself, Santa Clause!The family friendly event will take place from pm to pm and will feature a parade complete with Clydesdale horses, santas reindeer and sleigh.A special performance will be given by a  strong ‘Raise the Roof’ Childrens choir and a live band will also entertain the gathered crowd.Dont miss this great night of Christmas celebration, and watch as Ballymena is lit up with festive cheer!

After an introduction to the abattoir, the group was given a comprehensive tour of the kill floor and lairage.In the chill area, the group members had the opportunity to see dferent grades of lambs coming through the plant that day. Gary outlined what the ideal lamb is for Linden Foods to allow them to process for their customers’ needs, with discussion on how farmers can market lambs that meet this specication. The group was joined by William Chesneywho explained the grading system and what the grader is looking for when assessing each carcase as the lambs were weighed and graded at the scale, prior to entering the chill.William and Gary both reinforced the importance of weighing and handling lambs regularly to assess their market readiness. In particular, they emphasised the importance of not allowing lambs to becoming overfat. This not only restricts the potential market outlets, but is uneconomical for the farmer.The farmers were guided through the slaughter area where each stage of the slaughter process was explained. The visit finished with a walk through live lamb reception area where Gary was able to demonstrate the type of live lambs that produce the carcases Linden require for their customers. There was good discussion on the use of electronic identicationand especially feedback to the members on inidual lambs. Members stressed that, where they had invested in electronic readers and on farm software packages using EID to become more efficient, they were not receiving enough feedback information from the abattoir. Gary agreed that more information on inidual animals would be of benefit to the farmers. Linden Foods have invested in the hardware and software to allow inidual animal feedback to farmers linked to tag numbers and are keen to develop put this service in place for suppliers.The group members were impressed by the skill or the operators on the slaughter and processing lines and the efficiency of the overall processing system. The high level of animal welfare standards demonstrated was impressive in such a busy but efficient working environment.

Playing over  characters between them, Jo and Marty are still being stopped by fans eager to catch another viewing of the production such was its success during a run at the Roddy’s in August.“We wanted to bring the play back as we have such a successful relationship with the Balmoral Hotel, especially in the run-up to Christmas,” explained Brassneck Director Tony Devlin. “This will be the fourth production we have brought to the hotel. There has been huge demand for aof the show, as a lot of people didn’t get a chance to catch it first time around. We thought it was the next natural step to bring it to the Balmoral.”Jo spoke of how from the first night the play was staged “we soon realised very quickly that this was something special.”“The audience response was incredible after opening night,” she said. “People are still stopping us saying ‘When are you coming back, when are you coming back ’”“I think it’s a perfect way to finish the year especially after all the celebrations for Féile,” explained Marty. “One of the loveliest things was the audience reaction we got when we travelled to Coalisland. The audience there, who might not have been all that familiar with the beginnings of Féile, gave us a standing ovation, they were bowled over by the Féile story. To have a Christmas slant on it is just the icing on the cake. The performances in December will be a chance to raise a glass and tip the hat to all the people who created the festival combined with the celebration of Christmas,” he said.“The play starts with our two protagonists waiting to get into heaven, it will be a nice Christmas gt to find outFra or Bridie get into heaven or end up in limbo in Larne,” he laughed. A Christmas Station Once Again will be performed at the Balmoral Hotel from December  to  at pm. Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the hotel or by telephoning  .

I am not doing the work here for the students to recognise me in that way, I teach because I love it but it was such a great boost. I came into the classroom so happy and delighted to share the news with the class,” she said.Alanah spoke of the importance of young teachers making their mark in the city especially with so many who are choosing to go across the water or travel further afield.“Loads of my friends have left and gone to Liverpool, places like Qatar.

At the minute our ‘Mini Marillacs’ named after St Louise, are collecting for the homeless and I would put a big emphasis on helping those less fortunate and the girls would bring in hats, gloves, scarfs, toiletries which are then brought to the Legion of Mary for distribution.”“Our sixth years go up to St John’s residential home every Tuesday to make cups of tea, bring buns and biscuits for the elderly. I can see them from my window and it just makes me smile knowing they are going up and more importantly want to go up, you don’t have to police them,” she said.Alanah spoke warmly of the “community spirit” in St Louise’s and how “everybody knows everybody” as school le presents “always something new”.“This is a huge school but you know everyone in it.

These pressures have left many of our members on the verge of quitting their jobs.

Over the summer the aerospace manufacturer had suggested that a no-deal Brexit would costs it tens of millions of pounds.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson has accused business leaders of being \"puppets\" for the NIO.But Gordon Best, the head of the Quarry Products Association NI, said: \"We are certainly not puppets for others we evaluate and risk-assess any threats to our industry and economy.\"Stephen Kelly of Manufacturing NI said business bodies have been seeking a sit-down with the Prime Minister for a number of weeks.He said Downing Street had reached out to the ious business bodies earlier this week.\"Over the last month or so we have been asking the Cabinet Office for a meeting with the Prime Minister so that we can stress to her the importance of reaching an agreement with the EU on the withdrawal,\" he added.He said the delegation will comprise a spectrum of businesses, including agri-food, logistics, retail and manufacturing firms.Roger Pollen, from the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland, said: \"Our aim for the visit is to get some perspective from the Prime Minister on how she sees the path ahead, in terms of getting Parliamentary approval for the draft withdrawal agreement.\"We also hope to get some clarity around how the backstop,it were implemented, would operate practically. This would include both ensuring that regulatory checks do not negatively impact our members, but also how Northern Ireland might be able to influence EU regulations to which we would be subject.\"Above all, we wish to stress to the Prime Minister the importance of ensuring a withdrawal agreement is approved, so firms have time to adjust to whatever the future relationship may be, and that a chaotic, clf-edge Brexit can be avoided.\"DUP leader Arlene Foster said yesterday that she would like to meet the business bodies \" they want to meet me\".The BBC reported that the DUP had asked the NI Chamber of Commerce to set up a meeting with such groups on Monday to discuss the draft Brexit deal.Among the groups which see Mrs Mays withdrawal agreement as the best way forward are the Confederation of British Industry in Northern Ireland, the NI Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors.The Ulster Farmers Union has also indicated its support, as it believes a no-deal scenario would \"decimate\" agriculture in Northern Ireland.Last night Mrs Foster said that not every business agreed that the Prime Ministers plan represented the best way forward.The Fermanagh MLA said she wanted to engage with business next week \"around labour policy\" and \"how we are going to deal with the new immigration system which the Home Secretary is going to bring in\".\"Hes bringing in that new labour system and immigration system regardless of whether theres a deal or whether theres not a deal,\" she said.\"So we need to talk about that, and Im hoping to engage with those people next week.\"Mrs Foster claimed she had met a businessman who employs  people and has a turnover of £m who is \"absolutely outraged\" by the withdrawal agreement.She also posted a photograph on Twitter of herself with David Boyd, a director of Rockabill NI, the largest prawn processor in western Europe and a local subsidiary of Dublin seafood company Rockabill Group.Mrs Foster tweeted: \"Useful round of meetings today with Northern Ireland business owners including businessman David Boyd from Rockabill NI.

He was speaking after clashes with French fishermen off the Normandy coast.Meanwhile, trade unionists on both sides of the Irish border have said a \"catastrophic\" no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.The Irish Congress of Trade Unionsgave a qualied response to Mrs Mays draft deal.It saidthere had to be a orce, it should be as soft as possible and added: \"A UK-wide backstop with the entire UK in a customs union is preferable to a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\"We must insist that a no-deal scenario that sees the UK crash out of the EU at the end of March  must be avoided at all costs and is unacceptable.\"The consequences of such a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic.\""},{"url":null,"title":"who speaks for northern ireland on brexit business bosses or the dup","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By a quirk of electoral arithmetic, the DUP finds itself uniquely positioned in a make or break pivotal role.The party says it will not be moved irrespective of the supportive message those gathered in Downing Street tonight will offer to Theresa May. The stage is therefore set for an extraordinary conflict of political and economic interests. Mrs May may well wonder who is truly reflecting opinion in this corner of her increasingly disunited kingdom - the politicians or the business leaders To answer that question, it is worth ing to the only accurate gauge we have of Brexit views: the results of the  referendum in the  Northern Ireland constituencies.Who voted for and against leaving the EU and how do those votes justy or otherwise the trenchant attitude adopted by the DUP When the DUP is reminded that % of Northern Ireland voters in the referendum were Remainers, the party chooses conveniently to ignore the local result and claims instead that it reflects the overall % national majority for leaving the EU.However, can that argument be sustained in the current climate when the issue of the border and Northern Irelands future is at stake  Can the  DUP members of Westminster have an agenda which takes little or no account of the feelings of the majority in NI who did not want to leave the EU in the first place Only seven of the  constituencies in Northern Ireland supported the DUPs Brexit stance in the  referendum. Three out of the four Belfast constituencies voted to Remain in the EU. Nigel Dodds, the leading spokesman of the DUP at Westminster, represents an area in north Belfast where the referendum vote was split virtually   with a narrow victory for the Remainers.When it comes to her views on the EU, the south Belfast MP Emma Little-Pengelly appears to be the most unrepresentative of all - almost % of voters in her constituency voted to Remain. Gregory Campbells diehard Brexit stance was also rejected by % of voters in East Londonderry. In South Antrim, where Paul Givan is MP, the Leave vote had a majority of only  or .% in a overall turnout of ,.In east Belfast, regarded by many as a bastion of the DUP, .% opposed the partys Leave position - hardly a vote of confidence in the views now being expressed by Gavin Robinson, the sitting MP. DUP leader Arlene Foster in Fermanagh and South Tyrone had only % of referendum voters along the border supporting her Leave views.That said, the DUP and indeed people on both sides of the referendum result may argue that  is not . It is possible that the constitutional warnings of the DUP are raising new fears and swaying unionist voters, yet so too could the economic arguments that Northern Ireland can have the best of all worlds under Theresa Mays withdrawal deal, as business leaders are suggesting.It is easy to overlook the fact that Ulsters two main commercial hubs, Belfast and Londonderry, rejected the DUPs Brexit stance in the  referendum by a substantial majority.Sinn Feins abstentionism means that the , people who rejected the DUPs Leave position and voted to Remain in the EU are totally disenfranchised on arguably the most important political issue in  years since the Good Friday agreement referendum.In the land where one man, one vote was so bitterly contested, nationalists and unionists alike who were Remainers have no say at all at Westminster other than the isolated independent voice of North Downs Sylvia Hermon, who continues bravely to offer an alternative view to the DUPs.Of the  DUP MPs, only five can claim with any confidence that they reflect majority opinion in their constituencies: Ian Paisley , Jim Shannon , Sammy Wilson , Sir Jeffrey Donaldsonand David Simpson .Around , people voted unionist of one shade or other in the  general election, compared to , in the  referendum who supported the Leave campaign to exit the EU.The dference might suggest that as many as , unionist voters do not share the Brexit view of the two main unionist parties.In , Arlene Foster expressed her delight at the referendum result despite the fact that in Northern Ireland so many people had taken an opposite view to that of her party. \"We are now entering a new era of an even stronger UK,\" she said with a confidence which has not been borne out by subsequent events. \"I am proud of the fact that this decision was taken by the people and I will be working for the best possible exit negotiation.\"As First Minister, along with the late Martin McGuinness, she put her signature to a letter to Theresa May which set out their views on Brexit and which is particularly illuminating given the DUPs tough stance.For example, Foster and McGuinness wrote: \"We need to retain as far as possible the ease with which we currently trade with EU member states and also importantly retain access to labour ... EU funds have been hugely important to our economy and the peace process. Since , for example, we have benefited to the tune of €bn and in - we would expect to draw down €.bn.\"The voting statistics of  indicate that Northern Ireland was deeply ided then and it almost certainly remains so now. A total of , referendum voters in Northern Ireland who wanted to Remain in the EU have found themselves with virtually no voice at Westminster on this issue.This weekend the DUP assembles for its annual party conference and finds itself holding the future of the Prime Minister and her government in its hands. No unionist party has wielded such potential power since the heady days of Home Rule a century ago.The big question is, how will the DUP use that power  To what extent will the partys MPs recognise rather than ignore the concerns of the business and farming people assembled in Downing Street tonight And above all, will the DUP belatedly accept that when it comes to Northern Irelands future in Europe, a majority of people are not on the same wave as the partys  MPs at this critical moment in the UKs and Europes history "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37551023.ece/ed1d7/AUTOCROP/w620h342/unnamed.jpg","title":"can you help photographer identify these belfast characters","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For decades this has held back our economy and created deeper disparity between east-west investment,\" said Ms Bradley.Appearing before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Mr Paisley asked the Secretary of Stateshe would consider a feasibility study into a bridge between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland is a serious idea, says professor\"Weve seen ingenuity in engineering skills with the  mile bridge being built between one part of mainland China and one of the islands off China,\" said Mr Paisley, noting a link between Northern Ireland and Scotland covers a stretch of  miles. \"I think anyone who visits the Causeway coast will always be struck by just how close Scotland is to Northern Ireland,\" responded Mrs Bradley, noting there are issues around the sea bed and current on the proposed site of the bridge link Mrs Bradley said she was open to holding a meeting with representatives from Northern Ireland about the bridge. Branding Mr Paisleys request the \"political not the practical\", the SDLPs Sinead Bradley said: “People are literally dying on our roads, yet the DUP in their ‘wisdom’ are obsessing over a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland. \"It beggars belief that we cannot build a m bridge from Warrenpoint to Omeath, but yet the Secretary of State has agreed to discuss a feasibility study for a bridge to Scotland.“As political deadlock continues and our chronic infrastructure systems moves from bad to worse, it is bordering on offensive that the DUP would continue to push a pipe dream based on political aspirations rather than serve the people of Northern Ireland.”DUP leader Arlene Foster and MP Sammy Wilson have both previously voiced their support for the project. The catalyst for the bridge idea originally came from a speech made by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in January , in which he floated the idea of a -mile bridge across the English Channel to France - something he said would improve transport links after Brexit.Professor Alan Dunlop, one of the UKs leading architects, was asked by newspaper in Scotland to produce plans for a potential bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland. He laid out two proposals for the route - one from Larne and Portpatrickor a crossing between the Mull of Kintyrne and Torr Head .An artists impression of the bridge was released in September.

Scotland’s west coast is home to the UK’s only resident orca population, a group of eight iniduals that haven’t produced a calf in more than  years. MacCluskey told Press Association: “This pod of orca is dying out, they haven’t produced a calf in over  years. It’s thought to be because of pollution, so it’s sad that eventually they’re going to die out.”"},{"url":null,"title":"leaning tower of pisa is getting things straight","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I hope new hotel investment, which would provide the local economy with a signicant boost, can be realised, he added.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the council undertook a study to review hotel provision across the district and identied additional need specically within the Newcastle area.ldquoThe council has carried out an initial feasibility study on the Newcastle Centre site which identied that a hotel could be built on the site. General discussions have subsequently taken place with a number of potential developers about hotel provision in the Newcastle area,rsquorsquo he continued.ldquoThe council is also currently working with a consultant on the feasibility study for leisure provision in the Newcastle area and it is anticipated that a report will be presented to the Active and Healthy Communities Committee in the coming months..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan wildlife activist recognised by Prime Minster  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN teenager has been recognised by Prime Minister Theresa May for urging young people to protect the environment.Fourteen year-old Dara McAnulty is one of the latest recipients of the the Points of Light award, which recognises outstanding volunteers who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.He was presented with his award at an event held at Kew Gardens in London last week.Mrs May wrote to Dara congratulating him on his achievement.ldquoThrough your award-winning blog, you are encouraging young people to support their local environment and learn about the importance of conservation, she said.ldquoYour writing is raising awareness of how nature can help people cope with autism and you should feel proud of this remarkable achievement.Dara has been a driving force behind the Grassroots Challenge run by Ulster Wildle.In his blog he encourages other people his age to make videos of the out-doors and at the same time participate in conservation.Dara, who is autistic, says he is inspired by the beauty of the Mourne countryside on his doorstep and that developing a connection with nature helps him manage his anxiety.This in turn helped him to open the door for other people his age to become conservation enthusiasts too.Dara said: ldquoI am honoured to receive the Points of Light award. I sincerely hope that it shines a light on how vital nature is to us all, our mental health, our wellbeing and the survival of all le.ldquoWe need more young voices to speak up and take action for nature though.

The players ran their socks off and there was plenty of commitment. The tackling was hard, but fair, and it was a credit to the spirit in which the tie was played that not a single player was yellow-carded.The first half chance of the match fell to nippy YM striker Aaron Cheevers, who was almost through on goal, but was thwarted when Connolly came quickly off his line to save.Jack Roddy then headed narrowly over for Olympic and not long afterwards Olympic were awarded a free kick outside the box following Richard Annettrsquos challenge on Shane Rodgers. Unfortunately, Darryl Russell shot tamely against the wall.The best chance of the half fell to Olympic just after the half hour. Following a corner Gary Wilsonrsquos shot was cleared off the line and Roddy blazed over the bar.Cheevers was always a threat up front for the YM. On  minutes he was clean through, but again Connolly came out to thwart the danger. On  minutes he came within inches of putting his head on a cross by the impressive Wilson and just before the break his flicked header were narrowly wide.Ten minutes into the second half Olympicrsquos Simon Marmion found Joshua Fennell with a long pass, only for Fennell to shoot over from outside the penalty area on the right side.Four minutes later Damian Travers found himself with space in the box, but his left-footed shot was easilysaved by Connolly.On  minutes YMrsquos Sam Annett let fly, but his shot took a deflection off an Olympic defender for a corner.Both sides made a number of changes to break the deadlock and with five minutes to go YM substitute James Croskery shot low and hard, but straight at Connolly.The breakthrough nearly came moments later when Wilson delivered a dangerous free kick into the YM box, but Adam McDowell and Lee Maxwell couldnrsquot get a touch.In the first period of extra time, Rhys Patterson thought he had won it for Olympic, but Tate pulled off a great save.Just at the end of the second period Ronnie Johnston shot inches wide for YM after a good cross from the left by Adam McDowell.But the goals didnrsquot come and in the end it was all down to a penalty shoot-out. Olympic deserved to win, but it was cruel on the Young Men.Ballynahinch Olympic II: R Connolly, J Roddy, D Russell, N McGlew, M Rice, S Marmion, J Fennell, G Wilson, R Patterson, D Travers, S Rodgers.

The problems of vandalism and high running costs have made it virtually impossible to keep going any longer.Crisis points are no strangers to the harassed members of the hall committee. Two years ago they ran into trouble when funds for the hall completely petered out.The hall fell into an appalling state of disrepair and a public appeal to raise pound, was launched. Only pound, was raised and since then the management committee have an uphill battle to survive.While the hall belongs to the community and is run by a committee appointed at public meetings, the nature of the trust deed, under which it is held, means that it cannot be taken over or run by the district council.The hallrsquos usefulness became redundant as the old style of social s was replaced by nights out at licensed restaurants and by public house entertainment.Mrs Katie Williams, the committee treasurer, said: ldquoAlthough we still have money problems, the main thing we have to break down is apathy among the townspeople.

If anyone sees a route we have missed, please lest us know.Maurice added: ldquoWe hope that future editions can both improve the content and mapping of North Lecale and cover the Lecale coastline all the way to Dundrum Bay.ldquoThe book would make a wonderful Christmas present for anyone who loves Lecale or anyone with relatives aboard this Christmas who want to be reminded of the beautul Barony of Lecale and the local history of each parish. We have fully funded this publication so every book sold goes to develop local community walking routes and it will be available in most local shops.Cllr Enright said he was grateful for the knowledge and support he had received from older people ldquosteeped in folklore from every village and townland over the past year in producing the book as well as the invaluable technical expertise of his co-author Duane.ldquoPeople like Terry Swail, from Kilclief, Portaferryrsquos Lennie Lawson and Vincie Curran, from Myra, gave their time freely and ungrudgingly to make this publication such a success, he said.Councillor Enright said the book emerged from the process of developing village plans over the past five years with many public consultations highlighting the need for safe, off-road walking routes to keep people active and healthy.ldquoEvery village wanted to know how their walks could be integrated into the wider network of trails around Lecale, he continued. ldquoThere was a demand to know the details of the law and how they could assert local walking routes in their area.ldquoResidentsrsquo associations in the Downpatrick area led by those in Stream Street actually commissioned technical reports into how walks like the four kilometre Quoile River Walk could once again be integrated with the network of parks like Delamont and Castle Ward.Cllr Enright added: ldquoThey wanted cycleways on new greenways to Dundrum, Ballynahinch, Belfast and Comber following old railway lines and we packed all this information into the book with maps, photographs and references. I am sure that anyone with an interest in these matters will find it an invaluable reference document for their endeavours.The new publication has also been given a ringing endorsement by Dr Tim Campbell, Director of the Saint Patrick Centre in Downpatrick.He said: ldquoThis book illustrates how Downpatrickrsquos tourism hub around the Cathedral, Down County Museum and the Mound of Down could be linked off-road to every village in Lecale and rejoin the local way-marked trails like the Saint Patrickrsquos Way and Ulster Way to make a network of walks and cycle paths in East Down.The new book is available at Kevin Ogrsquos shop in Strangford, the St. Patrick Centre, The Road Houses Bar, Oakley Fayre, Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre.

The council also hopes to acquire match funding from central government.Among the key issues identied by council officials is either restricting or banning altogether unsorted black bin bag waste. Thousands of people regularly empty a iety waste into the bin bags and take them to the recycling centres. But that could be about to change.Council officials also want to vigorously challenge the perception that the centres are viewed by many as ldquodumps and reinforce the message that they are for recycled waste only.They say the misuse of the centres has potential cost implications for the authority, with the review examining detailed guidelines and systems which are required for what is being described as the ldquoproper operation of the recycling centres.The review examined entrance policies and a potential restriction or complete ban on large vans using the centres with a daily restriction on the amount of waste the facilities can receive.There is also growing concern at senior management level that a signicant amount of the waste being taken to recycling centres ends up in the general waste stream as it cannot be recycled. Council officials say addressing this issue will cut costs and produce savings.Last night, politicians were asked for permission to complete a detailed report on the way forward, based on the evidence gathered during the review process, with a particular focus on centre opening hours and staffing levels that must be achieved at no extra cost.Councillors were told the report will also make a recommendation to harmonise policies and procedures across all current recycling centres in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.Over recent months, local politicians have expressed concern at a number of fly-tipping and illegal dumping incidents across the district, with several taking place within a stonersquos throw of the Cloonagh Road facility in Downpatrick.This particular facility has long since passed its sell-by-date with work on a poundm replacement at the nearby Flying Horse Road currently underway.

The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

setting out aspirations in areas like trade and security co-operation and believed to run to a few dozen pages - in order to press ahead with the legally-binding withdrawal agreement.In a tweet, Mr Tusk said: “I have just sent to EU a draft Political Declaration on the Future Relationship between EU and UK.“The Commission President has informed me that it has been agreed at negotiators’ level and agreed in principle at political level, subject to the endorsement of the Leaders.”Mrs May is to make a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday afternoon on the latest developments and was speaking to members of the Cabinet in a conference call ahead of that.There was speculation that the Prime Minister was struggling to keep her Brexit deal alive, after she announced following her meeting with Mr Juncker that she wouldto Brussels on Saturday for further talks.Mrs May said after the meeting that she and the Commission president had given “sufficient direction” to negotiators for work to begin “immediately” on resolving remaining issues.It is believed that negotiators worked through the night to produce Thursday morning’s breakthrough.The new text was dismissed by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as “lots of unicorns taking the place of facts about the future relationship”.“Fair play to the EU for pushing it as far as possible, but it adds up to a blindfold Brexit,” said Ms Sturgeon.‘Secret’ Blair-Libya deal stinks, says Lord Empey Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Dficult issues unresolved - so extended transition backstop almost certain.”It remains unclear whether further negotiation will be needed on Sunday to resolve tensions over elements of the separate withdrawal agreement, or whether the summit will be a simple rubber-stamping exerciseThe PM has faced a strong pushback from Spain over the status of Gibraltar in the “orce deal”, while France is understood to have sought amendments to wording on fishing rights in UK waters.Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez has said his government is “annoyed” that the orce agreement does not specy that Gibraltar’s future must be decided directly by officials in Madrid and London.He insists that the issue is a bilateral matter and has threatened that Spain could vote against the withdrawal agreement unless its interests are taken into account.Mrs May spoke with Mr Sanchez by phone on Wednesday evening to try to deal with the situation.A Downing Street spokesman said: “She said there had been good engagement between the UK, the government of Spain and the government of Gibraltar in order to come to an agreement in the withdrawal agreement and associated package of memoranda of understanding relating to Gibraltar.“She said that the UK and government of Gibraltar looked forward to these discussions continuing as we discuss the future relationship.“The Prime Minister reiterated her commitment to agreeing a deal that works for the whole UK family including Gibraltar, the other UK overseas territories and the crown dependencies.”As the countdown to the scheduled summit intensied, Chancellor Philip Hammond said thatthe Brexit deal is rejected by Parliament it would unleash “political chaos” and could lead to EU withdrawal not happening.He told ITV’s Peston: “It’s clear thatthe deal is not approved by Parliament we will have a politically chaotic situation.“And we don’t know what the outcome of that will be.“And for those who are passionately committed to ensuring that we leave the EU on the th of March, , one of the things that they are going to have to bear in mind is the possibility that, in that chaos that would ensue, there may be no Brexit.”Germany’s economy minister Peter Altmaier told BBC’s Newsnight: “There is a lot at stake.“And thereforeit is possible to agree on Sunday we should do it.“I know there are a lot of ergent interests still, but I believe these problems can be overcome.”Meanwhile, it was reported that Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had warned the PM that her Brexit proposals risked taking the UK into a “Turkey trap”.The Dailysaid Mr Hunt told Mrs May the UK faced a situation similar to Turkey which has been negotiating its status with the EU for decades.try catch     .               ..

In the hearing Mr Burt said: • He was “disappointed” that he had no signicant progress to report to the MPs on compensation• The government had now reverted to its position prior to the committee’s report – and now holds once again that government’s role is to facilitate victims, not pressurise Libya• He was not aware of government ever having investigated journalistic claims that Tony Blair’s government sealed secret trade deals with Libya as part of its international rehabilitation.UUP peer Lord Empey said: “With regard to the Select Committee meeting [on Tuesday], I was appalled at the attitude of the government. They have gone right back to square one, requiring iniduals to take their own legal cases [against Libya]. This is grossly irresponsible and heartless of the government.”When serving as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson had begun to signal that he was going to press Libya to settle the compensation, he noted. But now the government has reverted to washing its hands of the matter, he said.“I have always believed that there was a secret deal between the Blair government and Libya. The responses at the Select Committee reinforce my view that this is the case. There is something rotten going on here. It stinks.”The shadow of Tony Blair hung heavily over the committee hearing.North Down MP Sylvia Hermon told Mr Burt that “somewhere there is something that is not right” adding that she could not help but feel he was being prevented from doing “what you would actually like to do”. The issue goes “right back to Tony Blair” she added.Theresa May flies back to Brussels to finalise Brexit text Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Committee chairman Andrew Murrison put it to Mr Burt that “the suspicion remains that some sort of deal was hatched between that regime – Tony Blair’s – and the Gaddafi authorities that kind of lingers”.He noted that they had quizzed Mr Burt about the matter for their  report. So he askedhe had made any progress with investigating claims about “secret deals hatched between the then government and Col Gaddafi in relation to investment in this country”.Labour MP Kate Hoey chipped in with “in the tent” – a reference to claims that secret Libya-UK oil deals were signed in a tent in the Libyan desert. Mr Burt stuttered repeatedly and said he had not been briefed to answer such questions, but Mr Murrison responded that they had quizzed him on this before and that he was “a little bit surprised” that he came back to them with no answers.The minister responded that he was not aware of any government investigation into the matter but added: “... I will make sure one goes out to the best of our ability.”Meanwhile, south Armagh victims’ advocate William Frazer last night raised questions about the same issue. “I am calling on the UK government to publish the details of any such trade agreements,” he said. Col Gaddafi provided vast amount of money, weapons and Semtex to the IRA. His regime went on to pay compensation to US, German and French citizens targeted by Libyan-sponsored terror attacks. However, for reasons which have never been completely clear, all efforts by UK victims to secure compensation have so far failed.Some £bn of assets linked to the Gaddafi regime are currently frozen in the UK by the United Nations.try catch     .               ..

Lots of unicorns taking the place of facts about the future relationship.“Fair play to the EU for pushing it as far as possible...but it adds up to a blindfold Brexit. Dficult issues unresolved - so extended transition backstop almost certain.”Ms Sturgeon also highlighted her concerns that proposals by the Conservatives could be damaging to the fishing industry.She wrote: “Looks to me like fishing will be a bargaining chip in wider trade negotiation .“UKG was trying to get commitment to annual agreements on access - looks like they failed.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

In addition to the Manchester fatalities, five victims died in the Westminster attack in March, eight at London Bridge in June, and one at Finsbury Park in the same month.Then in September, a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green, injuring  people.The events last year prompted intense scrutiny of Britainrsquos counter-terrorism apparatus after it emerged that in a number of cases, the perpetrators had previously appeared on the radar of agencies.Prior to his attack, Abedi had travelled to Libya.The ISC questioned the decision not to use travel monitoring and travel restriction capabilities in the case, adding: ldquoWe recognise that there still may not have been sufficient time to identy or act on his attack planning. It would, nevertheless, have provided more of an opportunity.Mr Grieve said: ldquoMI have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so, and they have now revisited their policies in this respect.The committee also said there appeared to have been ldquofundamental failings in the way police and the Home Office handled Parsons Green attacker Ahmed Hassan.But Mr Grieve said the case was not fully examined in the assessment because the Home Office failed to provide full evidence in time despite multiple requests.The report found that the system for regulating and reporting purchases of ingredients used to make explosives was ldquohopelessly out of date, and called on the business community to exert pressure on communications firms to stop their sites being used as a ldquosafe haven for terrorists.Security chiefs say they are operating at an unprecedented pace to head off the threat.Since March last year,  plots have been foiled, while police and MI are mounting a record -plus live investigations.There are around , active ldquosubjects of interest, plus more than , closed SOIs who have at some point featured in terrorism probes.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ldquoFollowing the attacks, the Government, police and MI undertook a series of rigorous reviews to ensure we are all doing everything we can to tackle the evolving threat of terrorism.ldquoAs a result, we have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information sharing with local authorities.ldquoWe are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their s.National head of counter-terror policing Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said: ldquoWe would like to reassure the public that ever since the attacks of last year we have sought to learn from what happened before, during and afterwards, and improve our wider operating model and ways of managing and mitigating the risk from terrorism.ldquoWorking evermore closely with the security service and learning our lessons, we will do everything we can to reduce the chances of this happening again..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: MI  umissed opportunities to stop Manchester bomber u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,Comments are closed on this article.Contact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the plans, which could include , homes on the large site at Blaris, get the go-ahead, it would be one of the largest residential property developments to be built in Northern Ireland in recent years.

Since Wednesday evening, several cabinet members have resigned, opposed to what they see is a softening of Theresa May’s position on leaving the EU. Essentially, for Northern Ireland’s business community in particular, it would remain part of the same customs territory as the rest of the UK and the entire area would be subject to \"level playing field\" commitments requiring the UK to follow EU rules in areas like animal welfare, environmental and workplace protections. Northern Ireland would be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than where in the UK, and more closely tied to EU market rules. But what do Northern Ireland business groups think   Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “While it will take some time to go through the  plus pages of the agreement, on the face of it this document provides some reassurance to our industry and the NI consumer. “It provides solutions to customs, tarfs, an innovative solution on VAT, support for the Peace Process and a possible longer transition period. There certainly is some work to be done by both the Westminster Government and  the EU on the checks and administration for goods coming in to Northern Ireland from GB. “That will need to be light touch and be mitigated in further agreements, hopefully to an absolute bare minimum. However this agreement must pass through Parliament. We have always said the backstop is better than no deal.”   Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general “After  months of debate, this agreement by Cabinet is progress. It moves the UK one step away from the nightmare precipice of no deal and the harm it would cause to communities across the country. Securing a transition period has long been firms’ top priority and every day that passes without one means lost investment and jobs, hitting the most vulnerable hardest. “Time is now up. This deal is a compromise, including for business, but it offers that essential transitional period as a step back from the clf-edge. \"More clarity on the final relationship is needed, and uncertainty remains high, but this is an important step forward. “Transition and the backstop are not the intended permanent solutions for either side, but should pave the way for more work on the future deal. This must secure frictionless trade, ambitious access for our world-beating services, and a say over future rules. “The UK has had many months of discussion and ision. A long journey still lies ahead but now is the time for decisions. And the first decision is to avoid no deal.”  Retail NI chief executive, Glyn Roberts and Hospitality Ulster, Colin Neill  “This is a complex and detailed document which needs considerable analysis and further clarication from the UK Government. “We will be consulting our respective memberships on this document and we will set out in greater detail our views when we have completed this process. “Both our organisations have always sought a deal that ensures no delays in the supply chain, which promotes bridges rather than borders and above all , ensures that Northern Ireland businesses have full and free access to the EU and UK single markets. “Retail and Hospitality are two of Northern Ireland’s leading sectors of industry and our voice needs to be heard as this draft deal moves toward a vote in the House of Commons”  Michael Hall, managing partner, EY Northern Ireland “Business will clearly welcome last night’s announcement in that there is now better clarity on the terms of a deal however many will also be reluctant to put contingency plans on hold until there is a stronger signal on whether this will hold politically in the UK and Europe. “The backstop guarantee is a positive development for NI firms operating on an all-island basis, not least the restatement that both sides intend to work towards a free trade agreement longer term, which should not be overlooked. “The scale of political uncertainty and the volatility which this creates can be seen in the signicant currency fluctuations we have witnessed in the past  hours. Firms should not take this lightly and as such, factor these continued unknowns into their scenario planning. “On the positive side, Northern Ireland businesses have continued to expand and employ more people in the period since the Brexit referendum, which we remain hopeful they will continue to do as we look towards a further period of uncertainty. “By focusing on business fundamentals and contingency planning, firms will arm themselves so that they are ready to act when the road ahead becomes clearer.”  FSB NI policy chairman, Tina McKenzie “Businesses have been calling for months for agreement to be reached between the UK and EU negotiators, so it can only be welcome that a text has been agreed and approved by the Cabinet. “We are acutely aware of the political machinations which are ongoing, however it must be remembered that without an agreed withdrawal agreement, the UK will crash out in March , without a transition period, nor agreement on citizens’ rights, nor any plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. “While the exact nature of the backstop is being robustly debated, it must be remembered that the backstop will only take effectthe future relationship fails to deliver a frictionless border, after December . “We believe that the Withdrawal Agreement is a signicant step back from the clf edge which would result in a chaotic no deal Brexit that would be deeply damaging and dangerous for our small firms. “We would encourage all political actors to keep this in mind as we move forward.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/shore_1.jpg","title":"alternative london the place to be seen in the city","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business From London’s thriving bohemian hub and street art capital to a food, drink and nightle must-visit... John Mulgrew explores Shoreditch and beyond Once just the purview of the artistic and trendsetting, Shoreditch has fast become a location worthy of a trip in itself when visiting London.Nestled in the East End of the city, Shoreditch offers up a buzzing cultural environment, lots of independent places to eat and drink, and boasts one of the city’s best markets. Now, those in the north west always feel a little hard done by when it comes to connectivity outside Northern Ireland.In this case though, Flybmi now connects City of Derry Airport regularly with London Stansted. From there, it’s a regular train into Liverpool Street station, and then onwards using the tube or bus across the city.Andyou’re visiting Shoreditch, it’s hard to miss Boxpark. Sitting close to the tube station, it’s an array of black-clad shipping containers, with a host of retailers and places to eat. A bite at posh chip shop Poptata helps fuel the day.Journalists often prefer the freedom to explore a city at their own pace – picking up things along the way, without being ferried from place-to-place. But a food-focused tour from Alternative London brought out areas that might have otherwise been missed.Shoreditch is famous for the sheer volume of graffiti and art strewn around the area, but getting an insider’s view on the changes taking place in the area – including paid-for advertising now adorning some of the spaces reserved for artists from the area, or a Banksy – really helps take in as much as possible.Christiaan Nagel’s mushrooms, which can be found in several roof-top locations, led us to teashop T, taking in a salt-beef bagel at Beigel Bake on Brick Lane, followed by the modern, family-run self-styled home-style Indian restaurant, Gunpowder. The aloo chaat is a signature, with punch, depth and zing, while an almost unavoidable venison and vermicelli ‘doughnut’ is worth the visit alone.A brief half in the grade II listed Ten Bells, which has links to Jack the Ripper, was followed by a familiar trip to Old Spitalfields Market. It has a dense, tight offering of top-end food stalls, from Asian steamed buns at Yum Bun, to Portuguese custard tarts and fruit tea at Yi Fang.An unmissable food destination sits across from the market. St John Bread and Wine is one of Fergus Henderson’s London outlets. It’s a casual, laid back and sparse affair, which allows you to same some of the best British cooking available. You can stop by for a very reasonably priced, and one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, such as Welsh Rarebit, devilled kidneys on toast or, my choice on this visit, blood cake and egg. Think richer, chunkier black pudding, crispened in a pan with a rich-orange hued yolk. There are plenty of spots to socialise in and around Shoreditch, with some of London’s better beer bars included. The Craft Beer Co has a location on Old Street, while there’s a Brewdog and the Draft House, hidden in the Bower development.Arriving back to the hotel in the evening, don’t expect dull or leless environment at the Hoxton. The downstairs is thriving during the day, with the usual spectrum of aluminium-clad Apple Macs, but at night, especially at the weekend, it’s very much a nightspot in the area.Butyou’re after a decent night’s sleep, there’s very little sound making its way to the bedrooms from the ground-floor buzz.Leaving the hip surroundings of Shoreditch, and heading to the rather more touristy affair of Leicester Square, the Hotel Indigo is offers a grand view of the London skyline.The new rooftop bar is a superb vantage point to overlook the square, and pick out the city’s most famous structures. Then there’s the National Portrait Gallery – which sits just a short distance away from the Hotel Indigo.During the trip there was a Michael Jackson ‘On the Wall’ exhibition – one for Jackson fans, certainly – but the gallery itself, which is free, is worth a visit for everyone . It also hosts a ‘Friday Lates’ event – opening into the night, and with a small pop-up bar for visitors.Not far away, the Japan Centre offers up a myriad of everything the country has to offer in regards to food and drink in particular – from freshly made miso, to a ied and wide-selection of sake, it’s a stop worth making for anyone keen on trying to replicate the flavours they’ve had while visiting the country.Meanwhile, Shoryu Ramen – located very close to base camp at the Hoxton – offers some of the best casual noodles in the city. Starting off with cleanly flavoured salmon sashimi, followed by the garlic kick of the Dracula Tonkotsu – a heady allium-rich version of their -hour pork broth.For those in and around what is one of the city’s most tourist-heavy locations, Granaio is a reasonably recent addition.It’s a fairly familiar format – Italian classics and a wide-ranging menu, which will keep the majority of visitors content, at a reasonable price, considering the location. A beef tartare was solid, and a ribeye cooked correctly on the inside, despite a lack of charring on the outside.The theatre obviously plays a large part in the attraction to London, but the Immersive Gatsy experience turns a chunk of a Long Lane building into an interactive re-telling of F Scott Fitzgerald’s the Great Gatsby. It’s dferent, but impressively choreographed, and something alternative to spending a huge wad of cash on a West End show.A crisp sunny day before heading back on the train to Stansted offered a chance to try Hawksmoor. The steak restaurant now has nine locations in the UK, and focuses on dry-aged beef and all that comes with it.A Sunday lunch of rich, pink rump of beef comes with a Yorkshire pudding, stunningly crunchy roasties and a roasted bulb of garlic, and shallot – leaving them soft and packed full of umami.

These aspirations are higher than predecessors. Harder to reach than MillennialsGen Z are incredibly tech savvy and have always lived in a world of interconnectivity. Most of Gen Z are connected for more than  hours a day. No wonder they are often referred to as the ‘always on’ generation.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting.
