Coronavirus has brought with it the same eerie scenes that have long haunted the modern imagination The end of everything we took for normal has a dire aesthetic fascination. The streets lie silent and still under unnaturally clean skies. A lone walker stares into a deserted bookshop. Office buildings, once vulgar, fulfil their true potential as sets for a sci-fi nightmare, glassily reflecting the empty city. While I do not want to in any way downplay the tragedy that has left thousands dead and will kill thousands more, there has been one eerie byproduct: the apocalyptic beauty of lockdown Britain.Take a walk through quiet streets for your daily exercise and you come across vistas sci-fi has spent more than a century preparing us for. A main road so still you can stand in the middle of it, among the squatting pigeons. A row of expensive shops all closed and dark midweek. Such scenes of The End have haunted the modern imagination since HG Wells described the abandoned streets of the imperial metropolis and devastated Surrey in The War of the Worlds. We’ve all absorbed these visions of apocalyptic Britain, generation after generation, from the 1970s TV chiller Survivors to Danny Boyle’s uncannily convincing dawn photography of an emptied landscape in the film 28 Days Later. Surely we can be forgiven a frisson of macabre awe at seeing all these fantasies become real.It might be healthier to embrace the nightmare than pretend we’re in a cosy new normal. I’m not too sure about “lockdown culture”. It’s all so positive and mutually supportive. Let’s bake, exercise and singalong. But imagination is black-hearted and feeds on shadows. Positivity is the opposite of sensitivity. The 18th-century aesthetician Edmund Burke looked honestly into his own soul and confessed that, for all the seductions of pretty things, he was more truly drawn to disturbing sights – a pitch-black night, a cliff face, a storm at sea. Burke called their aesthetic appeal “sublime”. Tell an audience gathered to watch a play that a public hanging is about to happen down the road, he says, and the theatre will empty.A normally bustling city or town that has been reduced to ghostly calm is a startling instance of the sublime. And a new one. For all the gleeful shudders of sci-fi, no previous generation has ever quite experienced this before. Writers imagined it and film-makers strived to visualise it – but no one has actually woken up in a modern world that has come to such a disturbing standstill.“When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday,” wrote John Wyndham in The Day of the Triffids, “there is something seriously wrong somewhere.” For weeks now, every Wednesday has sounded like a Sunday – and so have all the other days. When life outdoes art, we should allow ourselves to embrace the spectacle.For right now we’re surrounded by the sublime, and the disaster outside is much more powerful than the ersatz culture indoors. While art is reduced to virtual reassurances, a walk to the shops is a horribly unforgettable scene of a world turned upside down. My local shopping centre happens to be located in a classic example of 1960s futuristic architecture, with concrete towers facing the sun above a concrete piazza. Its time has come. It’s just a shame JG Ballard isn’t around to see the spaced-out queue for Waitrose on a Saturday morning. “The last members of the middle class fortifying themselves against society’s collapse with a final fix of quinoa,” he might have said. As I join the queue, I know I will remember this grotesque moment of pandemic life when I’ve forgotten every online art exhibition.The latest news images reveal a further surrealism: the lockdown in decay. More and bigger queues, as DIY superstores reopen. It’s rumoured garden centres will be next. As Ballard would say, the middle class must have its illusions even in the apocalypse. In truth, looking at images of gathering crowds, I feel a pang of loss. At least the early days of the lockdown were absolute. At least they were sublime.You can still find the sudden silence in the heart of the city. There are moments when no other walkers are about, no cars come by, and empty workplaces tower above in brutalist disregard. It’s worth seeking out such ground zeros of total lockdown. In the centre of the city in the day, you can appreciate the terrible beauty of the day the earth stood still. At least it will be something to remember in the sad convalescent years ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3070c1eec482dccac5a4b661403d86fbf3255cc8/651_1232_4780_2869/master/4780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1276f5aa7547f06dd26f36308559e2cb","title":"half tarzan half byron wild life photography peter beard","story":"Whether photographing elephants or Mick Jagger, Beard approached the world with a spirit of inquiry and adventure.

Hollow in the Land explores similar territory, but shifts the action from a Yorkshire pit village to a valley in Lancashire, somewhere among the clusters of towns and islands of moorland. Thirteen fragmentary glimpses of valley life follow the contours if not the map: the novel emerges from these stories, as an oblique but steadily focusing picture of the way things are.Moody eccentricity prevails, often at the edge of violence. Contrasts between fantasy and realism flicker like the light on the abandoned quarries, the ailing sawmill, the dingy pubs. In the chapter called “Field Mouse”, Jim and Lenny, a boy of 11 and a girl a little older, befriend the drunk former sailor from next door. His house is smelly, full of poorly stuffed animals. He shows off his “staff” with its hare’s-skull handle his wrist, tattooed with a set of numbers beneath a complicated compass design – the key, perhaps, to some underland from the imagination of Alan Garner. In a children’s book he would be their guide to an occult layer of the world. What he’s a guide to here is quite different.If “Field Mouse” is a fantasy story with the fantasy scraped out, “This Strange Light” is a policier with the crime ground down to a mark on the surface. Annie, a London cop, tired and disillusioned, returns to the valley for her Aunt Rosie’s funeral. We suspect from the start that something is not right: the story seems reluctant to tell us what, though it’s willing to admit to a mysterious stain on Rosie’s bedroom wall and Annie’s sister, who inherited the house, is full of an inexplicably restless energy. Meanwhile, in “Black Ice”, Benj, a man who recently finished a prison sentence for causing death by dangerous driving, pursues Dani the optician, whose husband has died in an industrial accident. Benj and Dani are full of mourning wonder and repressed rage at how their lives ended up. Grief in the time of alcohol and MDMA pivots slowly and then suddenly from self-examination into repetition-compulsion.Everyone in this novel is having an affair or suffering from something – skin diseases, allergies, brain damage from a fall off a quarry truck perhaps just a simple puzzlement. They have been drunk since they were kids. They live between work, or the lack of it, by day and, by night, at Brooklyn’s Wine Lodge, where on a Friday the bouncer is a member of “the valley family you wanted to mess with least”. They are all suffering static flight reflex, but it has given them a sense of humour, a distanced recognition and tolerance of other people’s flaws – an outlook that flip-flops from kindness to violence and back again across a round of drinks.Where The Litten Path focused on the miners’ strike and its immediate effects on a community, Hollow in the Land occupies itself with the deindustrialisation and impoverishment that washed across the north afterwards. Though the authorial voice is as forthright as the characters’ own, implication outweighs directness. The structure of each episode finds a means to look slightly away from its own denouement – sometimes the reader is left wondering what they have missed. At first the prose seems a little uneven from section to section, but as you read, your appreciation of Clarke’s grip on method and material increases. His images are startling and often startlingly apt: a solicitor suffers a heart attack, “sliding off the bench in the garden like scrambled eggs from a plate” roses are “shrivelled into little clumps of burnt cellophane by the winter”.This is a novel about belonging. The pressure to leave the valley, to find something – anything – somewhere else, is held in tension with the urge to return to its struggling hair salons and gloomy rains, its hillside ruins that resemble “the beginnings of a misspelled word”, where you face the inevitable penalties for your disloyalty. The hollow in the land is a zone of wrong decisions and deaths by misadventure. It’s only 10 miles long but it stretches to fit your life, binding the generations together even as it pulls them apart. You must take these characters as you find them. Without pulling punches or closing his eyes to anything, Clarke makes it possible to do that, in a novel full of insight, empathy and wry laughter.• Hollow in the Land is published by Serpent’s Tail (RRP £12.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91a97edaa9139114feb091218aadb6c834a3711a/0_27_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd559999b049f9450d3e56936870b737","title":"jd wetherspoon plans to reopen pubs in june","story":"After Tim Martin’s scepticism over lockdown, boss has upbeat message for investors JD Wetherspoon has told investors it is planning to reopen its pubs “in or around June”.All of the chain’s 867 pubs in the UK have been shut since the government ordered the closure of social venues on 20 March.Any reopening of pubs would have to be permitted by the government, which has not yet given any guidance about when it will start to ease restrictions. Few analysts believe that pubs will be among the first venues to reopen. However, at the start of its half-yearly results, Wetherspoon said: “The company’s immediate priority is to manage the business during the current ‘lockdown’ period. It is also starting to plan for a reopening of pubs and hotels in or around June.”Before the nationwide shutdown, the company’s boss, Tim Martin, had vowed to keep his pubs open as long as possible, saying that he did not believe closing pubs, bars and restaurants would help prevent the spread of coronavirus.Wetherspoon made its reopening prediction as it announced it was raising £140m in order to help it through the lockdown.The company said it believed it was relatively well placed to handle social distancing rules, once restrictions were eased, adding: “Wetherspoon pubs are substantially larger than average, and most have outside facilities.“The company is likely to make some changes to its operating model, assuming increased social distancing, and anticipates a gradual recovery in customer numbers.”Wetherspoon has drawn criticism for its behaviour during the early stages of the crisis, when it initially said it could not afford to pay its staff until it received money through the government furlough scheme, before it changed tack and said it had created its own reimbursement scheme.The backlash grew after the chain confirmed that it had told firms supplying food, drinks and other services that they would not be paid until its pubs were allowed to reopen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74d1ed753d70ffedf1938b055db5a0cc088ef5bb/0_19_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8592bfffe102a08eb6f2ab326d15d6d6","title":"uk car production plunged in march to lowest level since 2009","story":"Just 78,767 vehicles left factory gates last month, the worst result since the financial crisisUK car production plunged by more than a third in March to its lowest since 2009 as the coronavirus pandemic forced factories to close in an unprecedented crisis for the industry.Just 78,767 vehicles left factory gates in the month, some 47,428 fewer than the same period in the previous year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the sector’s lobby group.It was the worst March since 2009, when the global financial crisis caused demand to plunge. That contributed to the worst quarter since 2010.The British car industry was already struggling with uncertainty over Brexit that had caused an investment freeze, on top of the global turmoil caused by weakness in Chinese sales and controversy over emissions cheating. At the same time, carmakers needed to make heavy investments in electric vehicle technology to meet new emissions rules.The addition of the coronavirus pandemic has added yet another financial challenge. German carmakers Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler reported large hits to sales on Wednesday, mirroring the travails of owners of large UK plants including Peugeot, Nissan and Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors.Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “UK automotive is fundamentally strong but, as these figures show, it is being tested like never before, with each week of shutdown costing the sector and economy billions.“Government emergency measures are helping keep many companies afloat and thousands of people in jobs, but liquidity remains a major concern and will become even more stretched as the industry begins to restart.The UK industry faces a cost of £8.2bn – equivalent to a fifth of pre-crisis turnover – if plants can reopen around the middle of May, according to new forecasts by Auto Analysis, a consultancy.March production started mostly as normal in the UK, although factory closures in China, Italy and across Europe had disrupted supply chains. However, by the end of the month the rapid spread of the coronavirus had forced every large car factory to close. April production is likely to have been the lowest for decades, given ongoing shutdowns.Many UK carmakers are planning to return to work around the middle of May, with new physical distancing measures that range from taping off toilets and break areas to checking employees’ temperatures every day.Jaguar Land Rover, the UK’s biggest carmaker, plans to gradually reopen some factories on 18 May. Aston Martin Lagonda said it would reopen its factory in St Athan, south Wales, on 5 May, while fellow luxury carmaker Bentley will begin a phased restart on 11 May. Vauxhall, owned by Peugeot SA, also plans to restart production at its Ellesmere Port plant, although it has not yet announced a date."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e9cba3b226d47fefab05c1e914c9b848cf40aa/0_79_4577_2745/master/4577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fddcd73ec1a1898da0b913f8a885ec7","title":"france recession covid 19 lockdown economy eurozone ecb us job lossess business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as the French economy suffers its biggest plunge since the second world warSeveral major companies are reporting the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses today.Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is slashing its shareholder idend for the first time since te 1940s.

A shared paradigm, observed Kuhn, is a mode of seeing a problem that makes certain presumptions and privileges particular perspectives. It sees things. But it also misses things.As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, the British government relied on the wrong paradigm. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has insisted that herd immunity – the idea that allowing a virus to spread will eventually build up sufficient resistance in a population – was never a “part of the plan” in the battle against Covid-19. But today’s ’s investigation into the government’s early handling of the crisis leaves little room for doubt: the concept was fundamental to the government’s decision-making in the crucial months of February and March, as most of the rest of the world took a different path. It was abandoned only when it became clear that the NHS would be utterly overwhelmed and hundreds of thousands of Britons could conceivably die.There were other reasons why Britain remained a relatively relaxed outlier in early March, as Italy, France and Spain moved towards lockdowns and Germany followed South Korea in pursuing a rigorous test, trace and contact strategy. The distraction of Brexit played a part. A reluctance on the part of Boris Johnson to overly impinge on the rights of “free-born Englishmen” also influenced government strategy. It may have been assumed that because outbreaks of deadly diseases such as Sars-CoV had been confined to Asia, the new coronavirus would follow a similar pattern. Our investigation also suggests that ministers could have exaggerated the likely resistance from the public to more stringent measures.Above all, though, the framework was wrong. The laissez-faire blueprint for the government’s response to the crisis was overwhelmingly derived from previous experience of pandemic influenza. In the absence of a vaccine, flu spreads fast, becomes milder as it mutates, and populations can eventually acquire resistance once a majority of people have become infected. Herd immunity, distasteful as it sounds, can work. But as we now know, Covid-19 is horribly, devastatingly different. In the words of David Nabarro, the World Health Organization’s envoy to Britain: “Coronaviruses are horrible. You can’t just let this thing … wash over your society, because it will kill lots of old people, and a few younger people, it will make hospitals into a big mess and it will endanger health workers.”Britain finally entered into lockdown on 23 March. By then, the despair of overwhelmed Italian doctors had been broadcast around the world. That footage, and a now famous Imperial College advice paper, which predicted up to 250,000 deaths if the government’s strategy was continued, smashed the herd immunity framework. The same figure had appeared in a 2 March paper. Only now did it concentrate ministerial minds.Well over 26,000 Britons have died from Covid-19 and there are fears that Britain will emerge from the crisis with the worst fatality rate in Europe. The ministerial mantra has been that “the right decisions were taken at the right time”. But lives would have been saved if rigorous social distancing had been imposed earlier and the transmission of the virus reduced. This is a truth that should be acknowledged by the prime minister and his government. But it should also inform policymaking now that the debate has turned to easing the lockdown amid fears of economic collapse. There is still no vaccine – and nothing approaching a herd immunity strategy can be contemplated again. Until a testing regime can be established that matches the efficiency of those in Germany and South Korea, stringent restrictions must remain. No more unnecessary risks should be taken with people’s lives."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc0a16ff554ff2f10731c15781fb7aa56699f91/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ddde680510516d9e1d5a089f5c166d3","title":"my mother life british society coronavirus","story":"At her death, as in her life, the very areas of British society hardest hit by coronavirus were front and centreMy darling mother died early this month. Her death was peaceful and painless – and it was not due to the coronavirus. Yet it was shaped by the pandemic, as is its aftermath. The register office, the undertakers, the crematorium: the usual institutions of death are now inundated. The administrative and social rituals that busy your mind have practically disappeared. The friends dropping by, the swell of a funeral, the hugs: all are statutorily absent.It began with a urinary tract infection, of all things: a bothersome visitor but hardly unknown to my mother. If her body could not fight it off, then ordinarily an ambulance would whisk her off to hospital for stronger drugs and a bag of fluids. Not this time. The hospitals were almost overwhelmed, I was told, and parts are rife with contagion. And already she was so weak. On my mother’s last afternoon, I sat by her bedside, on the phone to the community matron, who told me that another nursing home had that day sent a resident to A\u0026ampE – just for the medics to call and say they were returning her to the home to die.As her only child, I took what I hope was the best decision. Whether it really was is still a question that wakes me up in the dark.Another question ought to be asked, this one in public. Amid the focus on pulling the NHS through this plague, how many people have had their lives cut short because they couldn’t get hospital treatment for illnesses other than coronavirus? The leading statistician David Spiegelhalter, at Cambridge University, told me he sees a “large transfer” in the number of non-Covid-19 deaths from hospitals to homes and care homes. Some have been mis-recorded, while others have died in their bed rather than under the stark lights of a strange ward. But, as he observes, “many could have had their lives extended had they gone to hospital”. The Office for National Statistics says it is now examining that gulf, but there is a high chance that those people are the collateral damage of a health system that has been starved of cash for years.When the undertakers came to take my mother’s body, three of the staff at the nursing home where she spent her last few weeks ushered me away. All were black, and on my reckoning, first-generation immigrants: from Cameroon, Ghana, and the West Indies. I would also guess that at least one earns less than the £30,000 a year the government proposed as the baseline for immigrants to get work visas. But for now they are carers to be applauded on Downing Street.A primary school teacher in Hackney for decades, Arati Chakrabortty would today be termed a “key worker”. And as I looked at the carers in their protective gear, too flimsy to deter any virus, I knew my mother would have recognised something of their world. In the 1980s her staffroom was a whistlestop tour of the British empire: Nigeria, Trinidad, Ireland, India, Pakistan. All women, quick on their feet and with their wits, and on pay far below their qualifications. Every day Mother went in wearing a sari far too lovely for the litter-strewn streets of 80s Hackney. During my school holidays she would drag me along to help: as we trundled down the road in our rickety hatchback, van drivers would cut her up and shout that she was a “paki” who should fuck off back home.She was more than they could ever know. In the 1940s, when she was little, her family fled the Japanese bombing of Burma on the last ship out of Rangoon. All except her father, who along with other Indian men was stripped of his ticket by the British and had to walk through the mountains to get to India. The trek broke his health and he died not long after, leaving my mother and her brother and sister to be raised by a young widow – in a place and time where jobs and money were men’s business. They were plunged close to poverty, then saw their family land in East Bengal disappear after partition. Even now, as our world is turned upside down, it is worth remembering that some among us have lived through far worse.Yet she had a will of iron. When the then prestigious Benares Hindu University made her sit an undergraduate exam in Sanskrit, a subject she hated, she retaliated by dipping her fountain pen in the inkwell and flicking it across the paper, leaving the blots and dots to be marked by some poor soul. When she arrived in London in the late 60s to do postgraduate study, she hunted for a bedsit among signs reading “No Irish, no Blacks, no Dogs”. But she hardly dwelled on bad memories, preferring to talk about how Sarat Chandra Chatterjee’s novels of Bengali peasant life reminded her of Thomas Hardy, and her soft spot for Maxim Gorky, his hard upbringing and good politics.This was the era of Margaret Thatcher and her “alien hordes”. The right viewed my mother then as it now sees Polish builders and Somali carers: as outsiders here to take from Britain. The left retorted, as it still does, by counting how much they give Britain. Even today, neither side sees them as people with their own memories, dreams, worlds. Who might have something to teach Britain.My mother’s love of Shakespeare and Hazlitt was not an attempt to fit in. She claimed them as she claimed all of world culture. Nothing was off-limits.That liberty was what she wanted for everybody ­– especially for the generations of children who passed through her class. She was the teacher every parent wanted for their kids, the smiling sari-clad lady who could turn round the toughest nuts.After retirement, she volunteered to teach Turkish and Kurdish migrant families who were moving into the streets where I’d been brought up – and when poor health meant she couldn’t manage the bus, she got my father to drive her. When he died, she asked me to lobby the school opposite her house for a classroom in the evenings so she could carry on.One other episode keeps coming to mind. Towards the end, my mother’s faculties were corroded by dementia. I wheeled her up to the hospital for a memory test. The questions were childishly simple ­– what is the date, who is the prime minister ­– but my mother’s responses were faltering, which exasperated her. It was not pleasant to see. Then, right at the end, the doctor asked her to write her name. For the briefest moment, a look I knew well passed over my mother’s face. Carefully she wielded the pen. The doctor looked down, then in confusion showed me the pad. She had written her name, all right ­– in Bengali, so he had no way of knowing whether she had done it right or wrong. Although silent, her message was clear: she would not fit someone else’s categories.Now she has left me, us. She will not see our toddler grow up, or meet her second granddaughter, who arrives next month. But if both girls learn not to be defined by others, to stay instead sharp and mischievous and free, then Mrs Chakrabortty will have delivered a most valuable lesson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af013ac97362af2b1fb874294338a81c11aaef40/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=651a22e52e00b0e77f6fcd30b2767554","title":"trees are bringing me joy in lockdown and heres how im learning to identify them","story":"UK’s cities are surprisingly green, with London and Birmingham having more trees per person than Paris or Berlin. But trying to learn the names of each species has left me puzzledI left London this week for the first time in more than a month to make a short film for the BBC. For such purposes, believe it or not, I am an essential worker. It felt weird, and not just because of the lack of traffic on the motorways. You get used to what lockdown looks like in your own locale seeing it elsewhere makes it new and strange all over again.During many fine days at home this past month, I have yearned for the countryside. But now I was in the sticks, the weather had changed from glorious to horrendous. The view cleared for me by the windscreen wipers was monochrome. Monochrome, that is, apart from the trees. Even through clouds of grey spray, they burned so bright and green that I fancied my eyes were starting to hurt.I rarely feel short-changed for trees in this country. We are lucky that our cities are so green. Germany’s biggest city, Berlin, has 431,000 trees. And they should know because each one is numbered, which is a beautiful thing. Given the devastation wreaked on the place during the second world war, that number is a credit to them and represents one tree for about every nine Berliners. Paris has slightly more trees but a smaller population, so each tree there is shared by about four and a half Parisians. However, London has no fewer than 8m trees, Londoners blessed with roughly a tree each, as are the 1m inhabitants of my hometown Birmingham, which was where I was heading on that particular morning.In the countryside this week though, every tree looked especially magnificent. I was driving to West Brom’s ground, the Hawthorns, so named because many hawthorn bushes were cleared when they first broke ground to build it in May 1900. That was 120 springs ago when those hawthorns must have been flowering as magnificently, and reproachfully, as those are just now that flank the M40 all the way there.As you will have gathered, I love trees. Many was the Christmas I spoiled for my kids by buying the smallest, gnarliest, most unattractive potted tree in the nursery. I couldn’t bear the thought of it sitting there shivering on Christmas morning while its mates were in the warm somewhere. Now I’ve taken to waiting until the new year, buying up these poor unwanted mites and planting them in a garden for them to live long and prosper.It dawned on me not long ago that for all my love of trees, there were no more than a dozen I could name. As I had an app to identify every plane in the sky and ship on the sea, surely there was one for trees. And there was, produced by the Woodland Trust, although I’ve enjoyed limited success with it. The Tree ID app asks for details of the leaf (simple, compound, needles etc), its shape (ovate, lanceolate (!?), deltoid) and so on. I have deployed the app all over this country and Europe. Walks have gone on for ever as I’ve lingered at every tree, brow-furrowed, ruminating on whether the leaf-edge could be described as undulate or serrate. I must be doing something wrong because as often as not the app tells me I’m looking at a monkey puzzle tree, when even I know that isn’t the case. So it is back to the drawing board perhaps the Woodland Trust runs a beginners’ course. Or I could do something really radical and buy a book on the subject."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc0ebeb7d0f852e3a244dd59cdcfb51faae45dea/0_0_3057_1844/master/3057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=333bdf040604351a86484cc31ed29a46","title":"famous photographers donate prints for food banks in pictures","story":"Martin Parr, Nadav Kander and Elaine Constantine are among 160 British and UK-based photographers who have donated images to sell for the Trussell Trust, prompted by a huge rise in the number of people relying on charity.

The plan to convert every street into a biocorridor and every neighbourhood into an ecosystem required a relationship with them.”The move to extend citizenship to pollinators, trees and native plants in Curridabat has been crucial to the municipality’s transformation from an unremarkable suburb of the Costa Rican capital, San José, into a pioneering haven for urban wildlife.Now known as “Ciudad Dulce” – Sweet City – Curridabat’s urban planning has been reimagined around its non-human inhabitants. Green spaces are treated as infrastructure with accompanying ecosystem services that can be harnessed by local government and offered to residents. Geolocation mapping is used to target reforestation projects at elderly residents and children to ensure they benefit from air pollution removal and the cooling effects that the trees provide. The widespread planting of native species underscores a network of green spaces and biocorridors across the municipality, which are designed to ensure pollinators thrive.This week, the \u0027s Age of Extinction site is looking at bioersity in cities and urban areas around the world, shining a spotlight on the under-appreciated world of nature hidden among the highrises and busy roads.The Covid-19 outbreak has seen cities and towns across the world go into lockdown which has enabled wildlife such as wild boar, deer, monkeys, foxes and even lions to venture into territory previously dominated by humans. It has also offered us the chance to notice and appreciate the natural world in cities in an unprecedented way.In this special series of reports we\u0027ll be looking at how animals and plants adapt to city life, what to look out for right now and how we can encourage more wild cities in the future.“The idea came from a narrative that people in cities are prone to defending nature when it is far away, when it is a distant concept, but they are negligent when it comes to protecting nature in their immediate environment,” says Mora, who has since become a senior design strategist with the global architecture firm Gensler, after a brief spell as education minister.“Urban development should be, at least to some extent, aligned with the landscape instead of the other way round,” he says.Were it not for the lush volcanic peaks that surround Costa Rica’s central valley, it would not be immediately obvious that you were in the heart of one of the most bioerse countries on the planet. Humans dominate and the country’s cloud forests, pristine coastline and emblematic sloths can feel a long way from the concrete and traffic.“We attract a lot of tourists because of nature and conservation but there is still friction in the city,” says Irene Garcia, head of innovation at the mayor’s office in Curridabat, who oversees the Sweet City project. “Places like San José do not represent what we sell as a country or what you see in rural areas or the beaches. Costa Rica has differentiated itself significantly but our cities are a long way behind.”But many urban planners are trying to change this relationship and the importance of green spaces in towns and cities has been recognised in a draft UN agreement to halt and reverse bioersity loss, often referred to as the Paris agreement for nature.Sweet City is just one of a number of biocorridors around the country that allow the genetic spread of species to maintain their strength. In Central America, this concept has developed since the early 2000s following an agreement to form a biocorridor network to connect jaguars.“Grey infrastructure makes the city warm up too much. So the idea to connect green areas is to cool down parts of the city, return the ecosystem services that were there previously but have deteriorated,” says Magalli Castro Álvarez, who oversees Costa Rica’s network of biocorridors with the National System of Conservation Areas (Sinac).“Inter-urban biocorridors have a double objective: they create ecological connectivity for bioersity but also improve green infrastructure through roads and river banks lined with trees that are linked with the small forested areas that still exist in metropolitan areas. They improve air quality, water quality and give people spaces to relax, have fun and improve their health.”Many Costa Ricans are happy to speak about the policy benefits of schemes such as Sweet City , as their response to the challenges of bringing nature into the city is part of a deeper national sentiment. It is not in this tiny Central American country’s DNA to behave as if humans were somehow set apart from nature.“In Costa Rica, you can start your day in the Caribbean, in the Atlantic ocean, but then you can travel and on the same day, you can see the sun set in the Pacific,” says the country’s president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, who credits Costa Rica’s tradition of pacifism and respect for nature with its desire to tackle big environmental issues.“I had to travel far away to understand that many of the answers were back home and the challenge was taking that legacy to the next level.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f258d37ed46e9e5034dbc670a0d6175c99e8e4c9/0_931_2217_1329/master/2217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc7d043ae1d9e6fe947ea0c7c0eadc7e","title":"irrfan khan a sensitive and seductive actor lunchbox peter bradshaw","story":"The Lunchbox star, who has died aged 53, was a vital bridge between Bollywood and Hollywood, and possessed a strong romantic appealIrrfan Khan was a distinguished and charismatic star in Hindi- and English-language movies whose hardworking career was an enormously valuable bridge between South Asian and Hollywood cinema. He was armed with a sensitive and seductive gaze: his good looks matured in middle age in such a way that he could play dramatic or villainous roles but also romantic leads of a certain age and of a certain emotional wistfulness. You could almost call him Mumbai’s Clooney — although it would be condescending to explain this colossal Indian star in Hollywood terms.I first became aware of Khan and his marvellous screen presence in Asif Kapadia’s terrific 2001 film The Warrior, in which he has a powerful lead role as the warrior Lafcadia, the erstwhile servant and hitman to a murderous warlord who renounces the way of violence, retreats to the hills and must then confront another warrior who has been sent to kill him. It is an amazingly atmospheric movie (which Kapadia brought off with enormous skill before his own shift into documentaries) and Khan’s cool samurai hauteur was vital in making it work.After a stretch of playing Bollywood bad guys, Khan found some further success in the Wilderesque ensemble romantic comedy Life in a …  in 2007, in which he was the gauche and leering guy with which one female character finds herself uncomfortably fixed up on a date. But perhaps the actual star-making breakthrough came with his lead role in the real-life drama Paan Singh Tomar in 2010, an extraordinary story that is a mix of Chariots of Fire and Ned Kelly. Khan played an Indian soldier whose talent for running made him a medallist at the Asian Games in the late 1950s – and then in the late 70s became a daaku, or rebel bandit, when he was involved in a murderous land feud in the Chambal valley with family members – he refused to surrender to armed police despatched to arrest him, resulting in a spectacular siege during which he was shot dead. The role – similar to The Warrior in some ways – was perfect for Khan’s ability to suggest mainstream heroism, but also a kind of capo di tutti i capi bad-guy aura, all encompassed in a still watchfulness in the eyes.In the English-language world, Khan’s international prestige had been cemented two years before that as the police detective in Danny Boyle’s feelgood hit Slumdog Millionaire, a Mumbai-set film based around the TV contest Who Wants to Be a Millionare? with Dev Patel as Jamal, the teenager from the ghetto who somehow found himself within an ace of winning the top prize on the legendary gameshow. He has to explain himself to the cop, and Khan’s mixture of tough, careworn authority with a hint of gentleness makes him just right for the role, as he almost certainly would not have been good casting for the brasher part of the Tarrant-esque host, played by Anil Kapoor. He was well received in Mira Nair’s immigrant drama The Namesake in 2006, and was also a potent presence in Ang Lee’s Life of Pi.In the last decade, Khan took what were arguably paycheque roles in Hollywood as the stereotypical enigmatic Indian plutocrat in The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) as Rajit Ratha, the corporate executive overseeing the fateful experimentation laboratory, and in Jurassic World (2015), playing the park’s super-rich owner. Cipher roles, perhaps, but ones to which he brought a deadpan yet debonair good humour.These were only part of a string of credits, but the movie that allowed him to steal everyone’s hearts was the romantic drama The Lunchbox. He played the middle-aged office worker who finds that the wrong lunchbox has been delivered to his desk, with a note inside. This leads him into a heartrendingly chaste, romantic exchange of letters with an unhappy married woman, stuck at home in her housewife job, as he is stuck in his salaryman role. Khan found his finest hour in this story, with an exquisitely gentle, subtle performance. Rewatching The Lunchbox and The Warrior would be great ways to remember him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7636a5f44a96fb88f60ec0b3d328ab4a591db7/176_50_1638_983/master/1638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d593c0acf992414b47b660106de077e6","title":"diana kennedy nothing fancy review mexico cookery documentary","story":"Elizabeth Carroll’s documentary dishes up a delicious portrait of the formidable Englishwoman who became a champion of Mexican foodThe 97-year-old food writer Diana Kennedy is the very model of something rarely seen today, or even 20 or 30 years ago: the formidable Englishwoman abroad. And, despite having made Mexico her home for decades, and being deeply respected there for her lifelong mission to educate the world about Mexican cuisine, I suspect she still thinks of it, just a little bit, as “abroad”.This short, sharp, marvellously watchable docu-portrait of Kennedy shows us her life in Michoacán in western Mexico, vigorously engaged with her community, lecturing and giving media interviews and masterclasses in Mexican cooking, taking long walks, driving herself around the place, visiting markets and not hesitating to tell stallholders if their produce isn’t up to scratch.Film-maker Elizabeth Carroll tells us about Kennedy’s eventful, romantic early life. Born Diana Southwood, she was a traveller who met and fell in love with the New York Times’s Mexico correspondent, Paul Kennedy living with him in Mexico City, she conceived a great love for Mexican food. After his death and with the crucial encouragement of the paper’s food correspondent, Craig Claiborne, she began to publish the wondrous recipes she had uncovered on her travels all over the country, and introduced the world to Mexican cooking the way Elizabeth David introduced everyone to French cuisine a generation or two before.She is now a passionate stickler for getting Mexican food right – which means doing it the way she says, and who on earth is going to contradict her? Even the timid souls who merely ask (reasonable) questions in her class can get told off a bit. I would have loved to hear Kennedy on the tricky subjects of fusion cuisine or cultural appropriation.

Here’s how to make some quick, surprising and simple mealsIn this time of struggle and strife, the tin has come into its own. It is a humble creature not often at the forefront of anyone’s mind, but in reality the tin (and its jar, packet and pouch cousins) are often the backbone of what we cook and eat. The store cupboard provides a springboard from which you can be creative and spontaneous.Tinned foods are delicious, nutritious and inexpensive (not to mention extremely long-lasting). Their existence is a blessing that means you can eat juicy figs and de-choked artichokes all year-round, guilt and air-mile free.The following 10 tins are just a drop in the ocean of options. There has never been a better opportunity to try things that perhaps you have previously turned your nose up at or neglected at the back of your crammed cupboard. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan. Once warm, add one chopped garlic clove and fry until starting to colour. Add a pinch of chilli flakes and paprika and cook for a further 30 seconds. Tip in a 400g tin of tomatoes, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cider (or similar) vinegar and a drained 400g tin of cannellini beans. Season, then simmer over a medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes.

Season. Warm 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. For each fritter, dollop into the pan a heaped tbsp of the mixture, flatten slightly and fry for about four minutes on each side until golden. Meanwhile, mix 1 tsp harissa into 2 tbsp yogurt. Serve the fritters with a generous spoonful of harissa yogurt.In a large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a low heat. Sweat 2 finely chopped onions gently, with a pinch of salt until very soft (30 to 40 minutes). Add two sliced garlic cloves, two bay leaves, 1½ tsp dried mint and 1 tsp turmeric cook for a few minutes until the garlic has softened. Tip in drained 400g tins of butterbeans, lentils and chickpeas along with 500ml vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down and cook for 20-25 minutes. Add 200g of spinach and allow to wilt. Season and ladle into bowls, drizzling over a little more olive oil.Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Add one finely chopped onion and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add two finely chopped garlic cloves, one bay leaf, 2 tsp smoky chilli flakes, a pinch of cinnamon, ½ tsp cumin and two carrots, cut into rounds, then cook for 2-3 minutes. Tip in two 400g tins of black beans (including the liquid) and 300ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes until it has thickened. Season, pile into bowls and serve with rice, a dollop of soured cream and, if you have it, some fresh coriander.In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil, add two finely chopped onions and soften gently for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, heat 4 tbsp oil, add two aubergines, cut into chunks, with a pinch of salt, fry on high for 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is golden. Remove from heat. The onions should now be soft add to them two finely chopped garlic cloves, ½ tsp fennel seeds, two bay leaves and a pinch of chilli flakes. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add 200ml red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by two-thirds. Finally, add two 400g drained tins of beluga (or similar) lentils, two 400g tins of tomatoes and the browned aubergine. Season, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve this ragu with soft polenta, pasta or a hunk of bread.To make a quick chutney, put 50g fresh coriander, 20g mint, one garlic clove, the juice of half a lemon, 40g desiccated coconut and one roughly chopped chilli into a blender with 2-3 tbsp of water. Blitz until smooth, set aside and season. Roughly blitz a drained 198g tin of sweetcorn and add to a bowl add a non-blitzed, drained tin, two eggs, 100g self-raising flour, 2 tsp mild curry powder and one finely chopped red onion, then season. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan dollop in heaped tbsps of the mixture, flattening each slightly. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden. Serve the cakes with the chutney and a lemon wedge.You will need three 125g tins of mackerel. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil from one of the tins in a saucepan over a high heat. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they pop, add 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and three cardamom pods. Fry briefly, then reduce the heat and add one finely sliced onion plus a pinch of salt. Sweat for 10-15 minutes until soft. Add 1 tbsp grated ginger, five crushed garlic cloves, one chopped chilli (or equivalent) and 20 curry leaves fry for 1-2 minutes. Add two 400g tins of tomatoes and season. Simmer for 15 minutes then add the mackerel, taking care to keep the pieces whole. Reduce the heat and warm the mackerel through. Just before serving, stir in 100ml of coconut milk.Heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Melt 50g of butter with seven tinned anchovies in a frying pan over a low heat, add one finely chopped onion and three bay leaves cook gently for 20-25 minutes until the onion is soft. Meanwhile, boil 350g tube-shaped pasta in salted water until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Once the onion is soft, stir in 50g plain flour, cooking for two minutes. Add 650ml milk, a little at a time, stirring until combined before adding more. Cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened a little. Remove from the heat and melt in 230g grated cheddar. Mix an extra 100g grated cheese with 75g breadcrumbs. Tip the pasta into an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm), mix in the sauce then top with the breadcrumb mixture and a sliced tomato. Bake for 25-35 minutes until golden and bubbling vigorously.In a large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil over a medium heat. Once hot, add 200g green beans, cut into short pieces. Fry for 3-4 minutes until starting to colour, then add four finely chopped garlic cloves, 200g cooked rice, 1 tsp chilli oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce and the sliced whites of a bunch of spring onions. Fry, stirring often, until the rice has heated through. Push the rice to one side of the pan and pour two beaten eggs into the space. Leave the eggs to begin to set, then pull the sides into the middle, ensuring all the egg comes into contact with the pan. Once it is all cooked, break it into pieces and stir into the rice. Turn off the heat and stir through two 170g drained tins of crab and 2 tsp sesame oil. Pile into bowls and top with sliced spring onion greens and extra chilli oil.Heat the oven to 170C150C fan375Fgas mark 5. In a 1.5-litre baking dish mix three 411g tins of drained and quartered pears, a 290g tin of prunes in juice, six finely chopped stem ginger pieces, the juice of one lemon and 50g soft brown sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, rub 125g salted butter into 250g self-raising flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in 50g more sugar and 50g roughly chopped almonds (or similar). Add 2-3 tbsp cold water and using your hands bring together into a dough. Remove the fruit from the oven. Roll the dough into small balls and sit them on top of the fruit, leaving space in between. Return to the oven for 25-30 minutes until the topping is golden and puffed up and the fruit is bubbling.Take One Tin by Lola Milne is published by Kyle Books.

Here’s the expert guideYou may have mastered several new skills during isolation – learning to hula hoop, perfecting sourdough, becoming fluent in any of the 100 minority languages spoken in Russia today. But one task is surely beyond the capability of mere mortals: cooking a burger. By cooking a burger, I don’t mean turning a small patty of minced beef grey. I mean a multi-sensory, artery-clogging, warm hug of an experience – like the sorcerers in our favourite burger places used to do on a daily basis before lockdown abruptly closed them.Given that we could do with a bit of comfort eating right now, I decided to get some of these sorcerers on the phone to see if they could help us recreate their magic in our own kitchens. So let’s start with the most important ingredient … no, not the meat!“Sometimes the bun is more important than the patty,” says Ben Denner from the London-based burger maestros Lucky Chip. “With the bun, it’s about keeping it fresh. If you’re buying from supermarkets then go for soft fluffy burger rolls rather than cheap brioche, which is often dense.”Lockdown hasn’t been kind to those lacking outdoor space, but for burger-making it’s not a problem. None of the experts I spoke to think a barbecue is the best way to cook instead use a flat, non-stick pan, make sure it’s as hot as possible, and resist the temptation to use oil. “A flat surface seals in all that fat and flavour,” says Barton. “Whereas when you barbecue, a lot of the fat drips through the grill into the fire.” He adds: “You want a crispy sear, because that’s where the flavour is. You can push the burger gently into the frying pan to get a better contact.” Don’t sacrifice this sear for the promise of rarer meat – the focus should be on getting the exterior crust perfected, even if it means a more well-done inside.Cheese is your next consideration, and Barton believes he has “never tried a cheese that doesn’t taste good with a burger, from super-aged Wookey Hole cheddar and blue cheeses to bog-standard American cheese that gets nice and gloopy.” Put the cheese on your burger while it’s in the pan to melt it. If your pan has a lid then whack that on, too, and consider putting the bun top in right at the end. “It will keep the moisture in,” says Denner. “You want it to be soft, like you’re biting into a cloud.” (If you don’t have a lid, you can steam the bun in the oven for 30 seconds with a splash of water on it.)Of course there is more to a burger than bread, meat and cheese. As Sophie Michell, the food and drink director at Byron, points out: “McDonald’s made an entire business out of burger sauce.” Her recipe for classic burger sauce involves mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, garlic, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce, with hand-cut shallots and gherkins to bring vital chunky texture. Trial and error may be involved to get it perfect for you – “I always use extra Tabasco for added kick,” she says.Barton believes the best burgers hit all the flavour notes: salt, sweet and sour. He suggests dry-cured, smoked streaky bacon for the former, and a sharp pickle for the latter. Sauce and relish should bring the sweetness to make it harmonious. I particularly like one of his expert tips, which he says has been hard-earned after a decade eating hundreds of burgers: “Put the pickles under the meat, because that’s where it interacts best with the beef,” he says. “Generally, when you eat a burger the thing that’s on the top is the thing you will taste the most because it hits the roof of your mouth and then down on to your taste buds. We had no idea about any of this before we started out.”You should now be set to make a classic burger – and all of my experts are adamant that a classic burger is best. But that is not to say you can’t try things out. “My rule is never more than two wacky things at once,” says Denner. “I find onion rings are always good in a burger, and at the moment I’m putting french fries in the bun!”“One thing I always do is what I call fairground onions,” says Michell, “because the best onions ever are the ones you have on a hot dog at the fairground. They’re not posh, they’re not caramelised, they’re just thick-cut, cooked on a high heat without much oil, and charred – almost burned – on the outside.”If meat isn’t your thing, you can still get on board. Denner points out that there are decent meat-free supermarket patties available these days. Michell, meanwhile, prefers to use whole vegetables. “I’ll roast or boil a whole beetroot, slice it into thick slices, then chargrill it and that’s my burger – served with garlic cream cheese and rocket.”Ultimately, it’s up to how you like your burger. “We’ve tried everything,” says Barton. “We’ve even put a Sunday roast in a burger. Whatever flavours you like will pretty much work, so experiment.” You may even have some time to do that right now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b73a8db52733bb708ea14d941958f476420e5d74/2026_574_3595_2157/master/3595.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e518480961cef041045aad499077ce48","title":"andy cole i dont know how ive done it some days are a total blur","story":"Former Manchester United striker on living in lockdown, how lots of transplant patients ‘hate themselves’, and the value of supportAndy Cole gazes out of my laptop screen and, even in our strange virtual world, I can see clearly how his face creases with pain. His familiar voice resonates around the room as he explains how low he has felt these past weeks while in self-isolation and dealing with the continuing problems of a kidney transplant in 2017.“There are many, many times when I want to give up, period, not just on life but give up on everything,” Cole says. “It becomes so difficult. I was struggling last Wednesday. It totally came out of the blue and I had to stay in bed. I conceded defeat and accepted that today’s not going to be my day. Previously, I would fight. But, ultimately, I know I can’t beat it.”The former Manchester United and Newcastle United striker, who has been working as an assistant coach at Southend United, is 48 now. Eighteen months ago I interviewed Cole and he described the psychological and physical aftermath of his kidney transplant in searing detail. His battle has now been intensified by Covid-19 and the ensuing lockdown. Cole is being tested to his very limits.“The past five years have been a shit storm. When I met you in October 2018 the biggest shit storm was just starting.”So it got worse? “It certainly did,” he says softly. “It certainly did.”He looks bereft and, in a normal situation, I might reach out and touch him lightly on the arm. It would be a small gesture to offer some comfort. But all I can say is how sorry I am.Cole looks up with a little smile. “I’m still here. That’s the most important thing. But people don’t understand what you go through with this illness. They look at a transplant patient and say: ‘You’re OK. You look really well.’ Externally that can be true. But, internally, many things are going on. You’re dealing with the medication and your moods. I’ve been very fortunate I’m never angry about it.“Your mental wellbeing is paramount because it’s so tough to deal with a disease that one day you feel unbelievably well and the next day you feel like a bag of shit. That was me last Wednesday. I asked myself: ‘What did you do on Tuesday to make you feel like this on Wednesday?’ Nothing. It was just that Wednesday came and I felt like a bag of shit. Couldn’t get out of bed. Thursday, I was OK again. I have to accept that sometimes my body is going to say: ‘I’m not having you today.’ So you have to rest and recuperate, and come back the day after.”“Kidney Research came to me,” Cole says. “I had an opportunity to pop down to Bristol where their lab is and I was absolutely blown away by everything they’re trying to improve. I sat in a room with 10 people and the chairman talked about the process of how they break things down and collect data. What really resonated with me was when he said so many people detested their bodies after a transplant. The mindset was, ‘I can’t look at myself. I hate myself.’ That’s the process I was going through. I look at the scars across my chest and stomach and think it’s repulsive. Then, you hear so many people going through the same thing. So I want to help people.”Right now, however, his transplant problems have been accentuated by the lockdown blues. “It’s really hard and, day by day, it’s getting harder. Once you have this disease you want to get out, exercise and be around people. When you’re confined to a small space and you have to stay indoors and you can’t socialise, it’s really tough. I’ve been living on my own the past two years. I used to find it really comforting to go see someone for a chat. It got me out of the house. Yes, we can have as many Zoom calls as we like but it’s not the same as being out, speaking to people, having a laugh.”Cole stresses that his family and friends are looking out for him on his own in north London. “Mentally, it’s numbing. Getting up in the morning, you ask yourself: ‘Right, what can you do today?’ You end up doing the same things and there’s only a certain amount of time you can clean up. It’s a bit OCD but, ultimately, there’s nothing else I can do. I keep saying to my mates: ‘I’m toast, I’m toast.’ It’s that hard mentally. But I’m humbled by how much my friends really love me and appreciate me still being here. What they’ve done for me over the past six weeks, and five years previously, has been absolutely unbelievable. Same with my family.”He is still separated from his wife, Shirley, to whom he had apologised in our 2018 interview. “I let a lot of people down by not speaking about my situation. I just wanted to think it would clear itself up. It was never going to do that.”Cole’s current isolation has made him understand how much he needs the support of his friends: “A couple of my mates popped around the other day, and I spoke to them outside at a safe distance. They came all the way from south London and I couldn’t ask them in. This is where we’re at now.”As a consequence, Cole says: “My mind never stops going. I’ve had a lot of restless nights. So there’s a hell of a lot of tiredness. I worry about having to go through another transplant. My new kidney could stop working tomorrow so I ask myself all the time: ‘Could you do it again?’ Some days it’s ‘Oh yes’ and other days I’m not sure.”Cole offers further insight into his health problems when he reveals: “Last year I had about six chest infections. On Boxing Day I was rushed into hospital. I didn’t feel well after I got back from the Man U-Newcastle game. I was really, really cold. My mate told me to call the doctor. I ended up going to hospital in an ambulance. They were running tests on me, believing I had liver cancer. That was a real body blow.”Fortunately he was cleared of cancer but Cole says he still has to overcome his reticence to open up and admit his vulnerability. He nods when I say he is speaking with admirable honesty today. “It’s gotten a little easier. I’m more prepared to talk about it with my mates. If you’re thinking of giving up on life it just leads you to destruction. But I’ve always wanted to do things by myself. And when I can’t do them, I struggle. I’m not someone who likes to ask for help. I feel like I’m burdening people – even though everyone always says, ‘Never, ever feel like that.’ It’s still very foreign to me.“I know I can’t do it by myself, even if some days, like last Wednesday, I tell myself, ‘Man, you’re here alone. Get through today and start another day tomorrow.’”Does Cole also sometimes acknowledge how well he has done since he fell ill five years ago? “Well, I ask myself: ‘How have you done it? From going down with the illness to having a transplant to where you are now.’ I don’t know how I’ve done it. Some days are a total blur. But my mates say that the improvement I’ve made in the last 18 months has been unbelievable. They take their hats off to me. They say: ‘You’re a lot stronger than you think.’”Cole’s desire to set up the kidney research fund was deepened by a trip last year to the World Transplant Games in Newcastle where he was “moved to tears” while talking to patients who had experienced the same trauma. Some were playing football again. Could Cole imagine himself doing the same one day – even if the man who has scored the third highest amount of goals in Premier League history would have to accept a huge drop in playing standards among fellow transplant patients?“Some days I say ‘I’d love to’, and some days I’m not sure. But if it came around again and I had the opportunity, I think I would go for it.”Cole looks so much brighter and he smiles again when I ask him if he feels any sympathy for Liverpool as they are so close to winning the league title that has eluded them for 30 years – only for the season to be in lockdown? “I can’t be biased. If Manchester United were in this situation I would be bitterly disappointed. Liverpool have every right to be bitterly disappointed. They deserve to be called champions.”But football seems insignificant when set against the struggle Cole faces. “It’s a rollercoaster,” he admits. “But I continue to give it a good go and fight as hard as I can do. You have to try and feel optimistic for the future. I’ve got to face the reality but try and stay as positive as I can. But, when I’m here alone, I have time to think. I know that this is my biggest challenge.”• To donate to the Andy Cole fund for kidney research visit here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdae9c34bdb8bcdb8aa2176fcae2b6fc40cfd8b4/0_95_2608_1566/master/2608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b4ac2de40f686feb375f274872b1b21","title":"many womens football clubs are short of backroom staff fifpro survey says","story":"More than half of the world’s top female footballers believe their clubs do not have enough backroom staff to support them, according to the 2020 women’s football report by the global players’ union, Fifpro.Having targeted players from the 24 nations at the 2019 World Cup and the biggest leagues, the four positions that senior internationals have highlighted as woefully lacking at their clubs were physiotherapists, team doctors, massage therapists and assistant coaches.The revelation comes at a time when a spotlight is highlighting the large number of injuries suffered by elite female footballers.Fifpro said: “Financial investments in the game and economic growth do not necessarily lead to improved or proper conditions for the players nor automatically translate into a better game.”Fifpro, in a “call to action”, also appealed for the introduction of minimum labour standards and, where not yet afforded, professional recognition for players globally. “The rights, interests and well-being of players must be properly safeguarded during this important period of industry development,” a statement said.“Fifpro maintains that in order to create any lasting foundation for the professionalisation of the game, a set of global labour standards for the working conditions of professional female players must be established.”They include demands such as the right to written contracts, protection in the workplace, regular wages and collective bargaining.Fifpro also called for the introduction of a set of minimum standards (relating to facilities, accommodation, transport, preparations and scheduling) for competing at international tournaments to ensure players can “perform at their peak”.While acknowledging that there is “great variance” across regions and that “no single formula is going to serve as a one-size-fits-all model”, Fifpro also insisted that “economic growth must be grounded in the establishment of labour standards” and that “ultimately, when labour standards are in place, growth can equate to higher standards of play, more professional clubs, and stronger competitions on all fronts.

But for Nicoló Lanfranchi, capturing the burial of Covid-19 victim Elizabeth Baez, 82, which took place this month at the São João Batista cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, was especially difficult.As he photographed the gravediggers in protective clothing with Elizabeth’s son Henrique, 49, the only mourner allowed, watching on from behind a mask, Lanfranchi thought of his own father, Piero. At 72, Piero was in intensive care with Covid-19 in a hospital in Voghera, in Lombardy, northern Italy – one of the worst-affected places on Earth.“I imagined myself in the same situation, and I started facing this possibility and I was really touched,” he says. After the funeral, Lanfranchi told Baez about his father. Baez thanked him for capturing his mother’s lonely burial – and for sharing his own story.That Brazilians – a sociable, gregarious people - are so open to brief yet profound human interactions like this is just one of the many reasons Italian photographer and film-maker Lanfranchi has returned here every year for the past two decades. The other is to take pictures.“It is a huge life school for me. I have to be focused, it is dangerous, no one can help me and I feel responsibility to bring back images and the stories,” he says. “It cleans my mind.”Born in Milan and based in Berlin, Lanfranchi has worked as a freelance photographer in portrait, travel, news, and photojournalism. He prefers to spend time on assignments he once spent three weeks on board the Aquarius ship as it rescued refugees around the Mediterranean for a series of  dispatches.Coronavirus has been one of the toughest subjects to cover. “I’ve been worried about the virus,” he says. “My father was on my mind.”Lanfranchi first came to Brazil in 2000 because he practises the Afro-Brazilian art of capoeira and came to be “baptised” in an initiation. Originally developed by enslaved African people as a martial art disguised as a dance, capoeira is an example of how this vast, varied country absorbs cultures.“Other people call this a melting pot. It is more the syncretism, the capacity of an organic form to absorb different things,” says Lanfranchi.In 2012 he photographed wildcat miners in the jungle, in 2014 a soccer tournament in a prison in João Pessoa. In 2015 Brazil suffered the worst environmental catastrophe in its history when a tailings dam near Mariana collapsed, killing 19 people and sending millions of litres of mining waste sluicing down the River Doce to the sea.Lanfranchi worked with Greenpeace, Amnesty, Vanity Fair and eventually supplied dramatic images images for a  story that Davilson Brasileiro and I wrote about an investigation into the disaster’s causes by federal prosecutors.In January 2019, Lanfranchi and I had just left the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous reserve in Brazil’s far north when another tailings dam collapsed, in Brumadinho in the same state of Minas Gerais, killing hundreds. At the disaster zone, Lanfranchi’s persistence, his ability to charm and cajole, and his skill at composing photographs in chaos rendered memorable images of the deadly, avoidable tragedy.He arrived in Rio on 3 March to make a short film about traditional medicine in Brazil’s semi-arid interior, but the pandemic shelved the project. Isolating in Rio’s beachside Ipanema neighbourhood, Lanfranchi discovered that the great composer Tom Jobim had written many of his bossa nova classics in an apartment in his building, including Chega de Saudade (Enough of Longing), most famously recorded by João Gilberto.That nostalgia infected Lanfranchi and he sought to take photos that captured time standing still and the fearful melancholy of a city where life was on hold.He bought N95 masks, found a driver who knew the city and began working out how to photograph the pandemic when so many situations – health centres and hospital wards – were inaccessible. He cleaned his equipment with alcohol gel, and changed and washed his clothes each time he got home.Using a drone worked for photographing empty beaches and an upscale members’ club for a story on how coronavirus spread among its privileged members. He also used it to capture families on their balconies.He put the drone down to capture food distribution in the City of God favela, street sanitation in nearby Niterói, and people ignoring social distancing advice across Rio.Some did this from sheer economic need, others didn’t take the pandemic seriously. The country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed coronavirus as “a little flu” and argued that protecting the economy was more important than social distancing even as confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths rose.Lanfranchi was dismayed to see Brazilian solidarity corroded by fake news and far-right populism. “I felt how sick the country is, people are supporting a president who openly does not care about the health of the population,” he says.This disconnect resonated as his father’s health worsened. Piero Lanfranchi had gone to hospital to get a plaster removed but caught Covid-19. Father and son communicated via text, until the time came for a plastic box to be put over Piero’s head to help him breathe and he sent a last message.Lanfranchi could not have seen his father even if had been able to get a flight back to Italy. Hospital visitors are not allowed, there are road blocks in Lombardy. On Saturday he got the news: despite the plastic box, his father had died.“He was alone, this is the worst thing, and something I wouldn’t wish on anybody,” says Lanfranchi, tears cracking his voice.Now the only thing he can think to do is plan a new assignment.“This is a historical moment, it is leaving a mark on me, and in a certain way I think about the other families affected with this, and I am with them,” he says. “I do not want to be beaten by the virus.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c98c6ec02edf86c78a21525e05572c4636a0b0a/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=542a8396aec2d70ceb2a60dedf49de54","title":"our pandemic subconscious why we seem to be dreaming much more and often of insects","story":"Stress can affect the quality and length of sleep. Scientists have been collecting dream data during the coronavirus crisis, with surprising resultsMost of us don’t often remember our dreams, but the anxieties of life in isolation and disruption to our normal sleep-wake cycles seem to be changing that. Several researchers are collecting dream data during the pandemic, including Dr Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School. She explains that, although it seems that we are dreaming more often, we are actually remembering them better because we’re sleeping more, but also waking up more during the night. “With more options to sleep, including napping in the day and longer lie-ins, dream recall is maximised, but you have to wake up out of a dream to remember it. We know that increased stress is a cause of waking frequently during the night.”Barrett collects and analyses dreams from survivors of traumatic events, including 911. She is now analysing 4,000 pandemic dreams from more than 2,000 survey respondents. “There are huge commonalities between how our dreams respond to traumas and crises. With clear visual associations, dreams are more literal. After 911, people were dreaming of buildings falling, hijackers with knives and planes crashing into things,” she says.Without singular images to focus on in dreamworld, we plug in our own visual metaphors. When Barrett analysed dreams after the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, she found that people reported “lots of monsters and invisible assailants rather than actual gas attacks”. Some dreams she has collected during the current pandemic are literal – “people are having trouble breathing or spiking a fever” – but many are abstract. After all, we know coronavirus is there, but we can’t see it. “There are earthquakes, tidal waves and tornadoes every kind of uncontrollable disaster. But the biggest dream cluster is bugs flying bugs attacking the dreamer, cockroaches swarming, masses of squirming worms.”More sleep generally means greater scope for REM sleep – the last stage, when we typically dream. Waking up more often during the night may mean better dream recall, but it can leave us feeling exhausted the next day. As for what we see in our dreams, research has long suggested that their contents are linked to our waking mindset. We process intense memories, current stressors and emotions during REM sleep our dreams are often heavy with symbolism and strange renderings of reality. It could also be that, as life is reduced to the size of a few rooms in lockdown, we have far less daily stimuli to draw from and are subconsciously digging around in the past.Those who have worked in crisis situations are familiar with the effects stress can have on dreams. Naveen Cavale is a plastic surgeon at King’s College Hospital in south London, specialising in reconstruction after traumatic injuries. Unpredictability and high-stake interventions are his baseline. Cavale says he usually “sleeps very well”, but this was challenged when he travelled to Gaza in 2015, just after the ceasefire was declared, to help repair the catastrophic injuries of victims of the conflict. Anticipating the crossing from Israel to Gaza kept him up at night, but the vividness of his dreams when he got to Gaza was even more striking.“I was shown a video by a surgeon of one of the busiest nights in the hospital. True chaos. I’m a very visual person and would lie awake in my hotel bed playing it over and over in my head,” he says. Cavale has visited Gaza 15 times now, and sleeps well there, but after visiting will often dream in vistas that have affected him. “I see the spindly minarets of mosques, fires inside half blown-up buildings and colossal craters where bombs have taken out entire blocks.”Some people say that they are sleeping better than ever during lockdown, and may be able to apply a “whatever gets you through” mentality of napping with abandon. For others who are struggling, it may be helpful to think about underlying drivers of stress and its impact on sleep. But as someone who keeps dreaming of my body being invaded by wormy parasites, it is strangely soothing to learn that I’m not the only one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec9a11c9f3182b4e492f2b110dcaadd3011b61b6/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0a6739eefb07ac98818790ac92303aa","title":"yoga with adriene how the youtube star won lockdown","story":"With gyms and studios worldwide off limits, online exercise classes are booming – and one Texan teacher has become the ‘patron saint of quarantine’. By  Marisa MeltzerHop into something comfy and let’s get started!” This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube’s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with Barry’s Bootcamp on Instagram, Mishler’s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as “the patron saint of quarantine” (Paper magazine), “the most influential yoga teacher on the planet” (Refinery29), and “Our saviour” (a fan on Twitter).Mishler was already huge before the pandemic – her channel, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for “yoga” on YouTube – but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built a digital replica of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don’t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate – also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn’t require any fancy accessories – you don’t even need a mat – and there’s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child’s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one’s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (“focus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best”). Some of the classes can be done in bed.Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she’s not: she isn’t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She’s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there’s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun – with her Texan “howdy” – or get a little spiritual and write on her website that “Yoga is really the art of waking up”.Right now, while we are stuck – in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces – yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn’t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she’s become the woman of the hour.These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail – which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili’s “baby back ribs” jingle – Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. “It’s best-case scenario,” she said. “My boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He’s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden … Oh come on, buddy!” – she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. “You have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you’re in the Groundhog Day movie.”Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor – among her early roles was a cameo as “cute female student” in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights – she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was Jane Fonda’s classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee’s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.“I had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything – it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you’re a spiritual person,” Mishler told me. “A daily practice that can be medicinal – you could roll out the mat if you’re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.”Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There’s the fear of looking as if you don’t know what you’re doing. It’s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they’re expensive and they require commitment.Mishler’s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren’t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space – Mishler did her workout in a living room – the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn’t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn’t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision – a strategy, even though she hates that word – to make her the yoga girl next door.In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. “He is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it’s a super-produced video,” she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. “Benji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that’s too heavy of a word. We’re here together and he helps set the tone.”As Mishler was crafting the channel’s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe’s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler’s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.The YouTube channel wasn’t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler’s videos aren’t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga – Mishler’s mother is Mexican – scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: “I am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.” And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,To continue, and awaken.To slowly nod with forgiveness,Squint the eyes –Just a bit,And whisper,I got this.I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it – along with all the other misfits who weren’t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey – and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn’t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn’t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It’s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler’s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by my bulldog, Joan, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I’ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. “Getting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it’s been incredible and unexpected,” she said. “It honestly feels like I’ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!” Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world’s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust – the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler an influencer in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves – Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, “a tight race between anything that has ‘anxiety’ in the title and also the yoga for weight loss”. She feels weird about that, she says. “I do not teach yoga for weight loss, that’s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,” she said, sounding a little defensive. “I know there is integrity in the content,” she said.While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what’s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene’s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They’ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who’ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we’re let out, and for Mishler, it’s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: “The process is the candy.

Some claims have also been circulated on social media, the source said.“They are serious claims and are going to be investigated properly,” a source said.Roache wielded considerable influence within the union movement, given that the GMB is one of the biggest donors to the Labour party. It has given more than £12m to the party over the past five years, according to Electoral Commission records.He was often seen as a critic of Jeremy Corbyn. In 2016 the GMB supported Owen Smith in his leadership challenge. This year, the union backed Lisa Nandy, who came third — behind Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long Bailey — and is now the shadow foreign secretary.Roache was first elected as GMB leader in 2015 and was re-elected in 2019.The union said that John Phillips, its regional secretary for Wales and the South West, has been appointed as acting general secretary until a replacement for Roache is elected.Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Keir Starmer declined an offer to back Roache following his resignation.Roache has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/502c90396bcee4d31f25b3cec960b99e6705fc95/0_0_6948_4169/master/6948.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7905643344312dab4c8260ebafd7c989","title":"back to the future why are we opting for nostalgic pop culture","story":"From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselvesNever before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us. It’s why we build every Subaru with you in mind, offering the very best protection for you and your family with our award-winning safety credentials.

So far 19 children have been affected in the UK and none have died.The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Wednesday that the country had more than a dozen children with inflammation around the heart, and while there was insufficient evidence to prove a link with coronavirus, he said the cases were being taken “very seriously.”Veran told Franceinfo news radio he had received an alert from Paris concerning “about 15 children of all ages”, adding that other cases had been reported in Spain, Italy and Switzerland. He listed the symptoms as fever, digestive problems and vascular inflammation.At least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition. Mark Gorelik, a specialist treating the patients at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, said all had fever and inflammation of the heart and gut. “Right now, we’re at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents,” he told Reuters. Gorelik believes the cases are not Kawasaki disease but a similar condition that shares a common cause, namely an infectious agent that triggers an immune response.The three New York cases follow a report from Stanford University in California, in which a 6-month-old was admitted to hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with coronavirus.Many of the children having treatment for the new syndrome have tested positive for coronavirus, but others have not. That could mean that the syndrome is not related to coronavirus, that the children had cleared the virus before they were tested, or that the test missed the infection.Some doctors suspect the syndrome is a “post-infection inflammatory response” where the immune system overreacts in the wake of an infection. This would suggest that in some children the disease has two phases – the initial infection and a secondary immune response that takes hold later.Dr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in paediatric intensive care in Cambridge, said the number of children admitted to intensive care units with Covid-19 was relatively low, but that some were presenting with what looked like toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease. “These children have had a severe and prolonged inflammatory response to Covid-19 infection and they have not had severe lung disease, unlike the majority of cases in adults,” she said.“Whilst this is an evolving situation, it is clear that these symptoms are reported in only handfuls of cases,” Pathan added. “The important message is that if parents are worried about their children’s health, they should seek medical advice.”The new syndrome, which has yet to be named, dominated discussion between leading doctors on a teleconference about Covid-19 in children hosted on Tuesday by the World Health Organization.The first known cases in Britain emerged three to four weeks ago, but doctors now plan to look over the medical records of children in intensive care earlier this year to check whether earlier cases were missed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df65e033048e96434b318434d929bacebe9c064a/0_0_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc55f48c29efbb4bc3e049b22aadbd96","title":"youth worker coronavirus youth services young people pandemic","story":"The coronavirus has left an estimated two million more young people in need of help. Where do they go when youth clubs are shut?Beth Gee, 19, has been attending the Station, run by Creative Youth Network, a youth club in Bristol city centre, for the last three years. “It’s a place to hang out, see my friends,” she says. “I can also talk to staff if I’m feeling anxious.”Gee says that before the pandemic, she was having weekly face-to-face support at the youth club, in addition to support from her local mental health services. Now she can no longer attend the youth club, so can’t see her friends. Gee is relieved that at least her community mental health team has switched to remote counselling. She has autism, an eating disorder and anxiety issues. “I’m lucky, I’m still getting support, but it’s on the phone now and instead of getting an hour, it’s more like 20 minutes,” she says.Yet Gee feels she needs more support than ever. She works part time as a carer, looking after 10 to 15 older people in supported accommodation. But she fears getting coronavirus from or spreading it to her vulnerable clients. “Yesterday we were told of a suspected coronavirus case for someone on one of my rounds,” she says. “So now, on top of the masks and gloves, we’re having to wear face shields. It’s very worrying.”Gee is far from alone in having heightened anxiety levels during the pandemic. New research by the National Youth Agency, which works with youth organisations and young people across the UK, and the children’s commissioner, published on Wednesday, shows that there are now 3 million vulnerable young people in England who need support with family relationships, mental health, domestic abuse, or other needs. That’s 2 million more vulnerable eight to 19-year-olds needing help because of the pandemic.The figures were estimated from emerging data collated in March and April, including from helplines, sector reports and grassroots evidence, and compared with existing official data such as the numbers of children living with a vulnerable family background, figures on offending behaviour and NHS data on mental health.For many, youth clubs provide a vital lifeline, offering somewhere to go, something to do and a trusted adult to talk to. But the lockdown means youth services, already decimated after a decade of austerity, are not easily able to meet this extra need for help. Local authority youth workers have mostly been redeployed, while voluntary, sector-run youth clubs and centres have shut their doors and are providing limited services online. Most street-based youth work has ceased.The report estimates that nationally one in five youth clubs will not reopen, with a higher proportion staying shut in some regions, and calls for swift and generous action from ministers. “The government needs to provide urgent resources and funding to safeguard youth services,” says Leigh Middleton, chief executive of the National Youth Agency. “Three times the number of young people are at risk as a result of the lockdown, yet just as they need us most, the pandemic is pushing many youth organisations to the brink.”But it’s not all doom and gloom. In Leeds, for example, charity Barca, which runs youth clubs for 11 to 19-year-olds, is managing to reach many of the young people it works with digitally.Virtual club sessions through Zoom, and one-to-one online drop-in sessions with youth workers at fixed times five days a week, are both proving popular.Barca has also distributed 74 activity packs for young people and their younger siblings. “It’s great for them, but it also allows us to have face-to-face contact,” says Amanda Sykes, senior practitioner in Barca’s children, young people and family service.And last week the charity held its first socially distant doorstep dance session, run by social enterprise Dazl. “We had 50 people out in their gardens and 30 joined in,” says Sykes. For Demi, 13, who used to do activities such as football and cooking at the Fairfield Community Centre youth club in west Leeds, it made her day. “I have been really bored since school shut, but today was brilliant,” she says. Barca plans to roll out doorstep dance to other streets and start running doorstep sport sessions too.While digital support is better than no youth service at all, there are growing calls for youth centres to reopen. The NYA report calls for youth services to be designated as key work, so that youth workers can provide face-to-face support to vulnerable young people. “The risk to young people of catching coronavirus has to be balanced against the health risks of remaining in lockdown,” says Middleton.In Wales, where the Welsh government still funds statutory youth services and last year announced a new youth work strategy and a £6.2m increase in funding in its 2020-21 budget, some youth centres have stayed open during lockdown.David Williams, who manages Torfaen borough council’s youth service, in south Wales, says that statutory youth workers are currently helping support vulnerable and at risk children in schools. And for care leavers, there is still a face-to-face service. Weekly appointments at the Ashley House Youth Centre are strictly spaced so that the building can be cleaned between visitors, a one-way system is in place to ensure social distancing and youth workers are only allowed into the building for the duration of their meeting with the young person. “It means we can ensure that they have a hot meal, that their phone is charged and clothes are cleaned,” says Williams. “But most importantly, they get to speak to a youth worker, who in many cases will be the only person they have spoken to that week.”Some youth services in England hope to open their doors in the next few weeks. Stuart Dunne, chief executive of Youth Focus NW, a charity supporting youth provision across the north-west, says that all 23 local authority youth services are operating online. “A number are planning to reopen centres quite soon,” he says, “while respecting two-metre distancing rules and limiting the number of young people who can attend at any one time.”Ultimately, the nature of youth work will have to change. “We have to make sure that after lockdown ends, services are not only put back, but developed,” says Melanie Ryan, joint chief executive of Youth Cymru, the national umbrella body for youth organisations in Wales.Ian McLaughlan, chief executive of Youth Scotland, which supports 65,000 young people, 1,300 youth groups and more than 8,000 youth workers, agrees. He estimates that in Scotland, around half the youth groups have stopped operating for now, while the rest are operating digitally. Yet the Scottish government provides core funding to national youth services and has provided an extra £350m to councils and charities, some of which will find its way to youth services. “We’re not hearing that many youth groups saying they will have to shut down completely,” he says.A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport says: “We are committed to doing all we can to help young people in these challenging times. This includes grants available to youth organisations from the National Lottery Community Fund, Sport England and the Arts Council, and the unprecedented Treasury coronavirus support package for workers and businesses.“Our £500m youth investment fund will also provide long-term investment in the sector and make a positive contribution to many young people’s lives.”Back in Bristol, Gee hopes that after the lockdown, there will be less loneliness, a greater sense of community, and more human interaction. “I hope people understand that being able to socialise is so important for everyone.” For now, she is counting down the days until she can go back to Creative Networks and see her friends again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc12b52ebd15287cfc93da9d920303dda3e53ec/0_80_3326_1996/master/3326.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0fba2fbe1d3d624d3a7ba4b46877475","title":"uk athletics ukad review mo farah alberto salazar","story":"UK Athletics has finally handed over to the UK Anti-Doping Agency its full internal 2015 review into Mo Farah’s relationship with Alberto Salazar.The report, which is said to include detailed accounts of Farah’s training and medical data, came after repeated requests from Ukad to see it as well as an extraordinary rebuke from Ukad’s chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, to UK Athletics last month.Previously, Ukad had seen only an edited Powerpoint executive summary of the 2015 report, which was led by three former athletes and concluded there were “no concerns” about Farah continuing with Salazar, despite a BBC Panorama programme raising questions about the American coach.Salazar, who guided Farah to Olympic gold over 5,000m and 10,000m at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Games, was banned from the sport in 2019 after being found guilty of doping violations. However he is appealing against his ban. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Farah, who worked under Salazar between 2011 and 2017.A UK Athletics spokesperson confirmed the news and said the organisation “remains fully committed to protecting the integrity of the sport and the pursuit of clean athletics”, adding: “We will continue to assist Ukad with any further queries.”On Tuesday it was announced that Sarah Rowell, who led the UKA internal investigation, is to step down from the UK Athletics board a year earlier than planned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24058669ab1942494b630b4b0fabd58affabc51c/0_159_3764_2258/master/3764.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b963986ae292695da4886a0f3a8a8e3","title":"uk government at least a week away from giving sport the green light","story":"The prospects of sport being given approval on Friday to restart behind closed doors when it meets the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and Public Health England have been heavily played down – with those involved in the talks saying any such move is at least a week away.It is understood that any potential relaxations for the Premier League, horse racing, cricket and rugby – all of whose representatives will be involved in the conference call on Friday – will not come until the government has announced on 7 May its broader plans to ease Britain’s lockdown status.Instead the meeting is likely to focus on proposals from two working groups, which have separately looked at when it might be safe for sport to return to full training, and the rules that need to be in place for competitions to be played behind closed doors.The Premier League, which is holding a separate conference call with its clubs on Friday morning, also does not expect to hold a vote on its next formal move regarding the response to coronavirus before 7 May. However, clubs will be briefed on aspects of its Project Restart, including plans for testing and the possibility of games being played on neutral territory.While the best-case scenario of the football season being resumed in June has been modelled, the Premier League’s cautious stance reflects a reluctance to rush back.The Bundesliga intends to resume its 2019-20 season on 9 May, but it has been noted by the Premier League that the date is no longer certain given Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has suggested tighter restrictions may have to be implemented because of concerns that cases of the virus could multiply again.Meanwhile Uefa’s medical chief professor, Tim Meyer, has said it is “definitely possible” to plan for the 2019-20 season to restart, despite France’s Ligue 1 becoming the second major European league to be cancelled after the Dutch Ereisie.Speaking a day after Fifa’s medical chief, Michel D’Hooghe, warned it would not be possible to play football before social contact was permitted – and that September was a realistic target – Meyer sounded a more optimistic note.“All football organisations which are planning the restart of their competitions will produce comprehensive protocols to ensure that the health of those involved in the games is protected,” he said. “Under these conditions, it is definitely possible to plan the restart of competitions suspended during the 2019-20 season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7bf3e3f9ba75cb95758bfef96e3a053be36bcf/34_236_3157_1894/master/3157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26aa267c903859d9f07c97e0ba275209","title":"unexpected timeout offers global sport overdue major climatic rethink cricket euro 2020","story":"Sustainability is already on the agenda and it needs to be in a country that sends three cricket teams on tour every winterWith no live sport to watch or play, exercise has never been more precious. Those minutes of freedom, an uncurling away from bad posture on the sofa, lifting the spirits and boosting the heart rate. But, as you slurp your morning lungfuls of air, have your noticed a change? Think the sky has looked a more perfect cornflower, noticed the stars shining a little brighter?You would be right on all three, the falling levels of air pollution a tiny silver lining to our dreadful predicament. Yet air pollution also has a more sinister role in the coronavirus story.Some preliminary studies in the US seem to suggest a link between a high death rate and high levels of pollution (a similar link was found during the Sars outbreak in 2003), with Covid-19 able to attach itself to particulate pollution. So improving air quality might be one of the ways out of this crisis, as well as helping the 4.2 million people who die annually from your bog‑standard air pollution. But where does sport fit in?We know athletes are particularly at risk from poor air quality because of their higher respiratory rates during exercise – children in particular. And around the world athletes have started to complain: Novak Djokovic, who criticised pollution levels in China the New South Wales spinner Steve O’Keefe, who described the air quality during a Sheffield Shield game as fires burned outside Sydney as like “smoking 80 cigarettes a day” the tennis player Dalila Jakupovic, who pulled out of her Australian Open game because she couldn’t breathe.Not only that, but pollution also seems to impede performance. A fascinating essay by Matthew Campelli in the Sustainability Report this week examines just that, revealing that early trials seem to show air pollution reducing the productivity rates of German footballers and impeding decision-making in chess players and baseball umpires.This dovetails alarmingly with the Hit for Six report published last September, which described the effects of extreme heat not only on cricketers’ ability to function physically but also their capacity, and umpires’ capacity, to make decisions.Throw in the bushfires in Australia last year which threatened the cricket season, the cancellation of matches in the path of a super typhoon during the Rugby World Cup in Japan, cricketers vomiting on the pitch because of air pollution in Delhi, cricket stadiums being destroyed by hurricanes in the West Indies, the ski season literally melting away and rising sea levels threatening coastal infrastructure, and the picture of sport in a climate emergency starts to look less than rosy.Add our current crisis, with normal sporting relations unlikely to restart any time soon, and sport is looking at an extremely complicated situation. Maybe the Premier League can restart in a couple of months, but what about European football? Players may get special passports which mean they avoid quarantine at airports, but what about away supporters? In Japan, meanwhile, nervous voices are already expressing doubt over the Tokyo Olympics mark two, pencilled in for the summer of 2021.An existential problem then, and one that coincides with an enforced period of contemplation. Much like the rest of the world, sport has the opportunity to hit the reset button. It is going to have to work within a smaller framework, with a much emptier purse, in a world where air travel is expensive, and perceived as dangerous to human health as well as the planet, as the earth grows ever warmer – with 2020 already set to be the hottest year yet.Some might argue that with no gate receipts, no bar takings and a fixture list with more holes than games, sport is in no place to be gazing at its environmental soul. But if not now, when?On Wednesday the sports sector held its own version of the Petersberg climate dialogue, a Zoom meeting organised by Basis (the British Association for Sustainable Sport) with the idea of bringing the sector together. The idea is to hold a similar meeting weekly for the foreseeable future, to try to hammer out a way for sport to move forward.This is sport’s chance to evaluate properly its current plight – as some have already started to do. To embrace localism. Accept that less is more. Ask itself why. Why do the England cricket teams have to tour three countries in a winter? Why is the ICC planning to host T20 World Cups in consecutive years? Why on earth hold football’s European Championship across 12 host cities? Why must the Olympic Games move to a different city every four years? Why squeeze every drop out of athletes for maximum profit until they cannot cope and break down, both mentally or physically? Why not demand lower levels of pollution around sports grounds for the good of athletes and fans? Reset. Breathe.Who has time for sustainability now? Sport does. It has to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68dae24a8979f823c37f695cdcc8a7cd05b3e4ce/0_192_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30b7e6f2051ed7258ae0837c95625ca7","title":"amazon thermal cameras china dahua","story":"Cameras to check workers’ temperatures amid coronavirus come from Dahua, which allegedly helped Beijing detain MuslimsAmazon has bought cameras to take the temperatures of workers during the coronavirus pandemic from a firm the US previously blacklisted over allegations it helped China detain and monitor the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.China’s Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd shipped 1,500 cameras to Amazon this month in a deal valued close to $10m, one of the people said. At least 500 Dahua systems are for Amazon’s use in the US, another person said.The Amazon procurement, which has not been previously reported, is legal because the rules control US government contract awards and exports to blacklisted firms, but they do not stop sales to the private sector.However, the US “considers that transactions of any nature with listed entities carry a ‘red flag’ and recommends that US companies proceed with caution”, according to the bureau of industry and security’s website. Dahua has disputed the designation, and Beijing has denied mistreatment of the minority groups.The deal comes as the US Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of temperature-reading devices and said it would not halt certain pandemic uses of thermal cameras that lack the agency’s regulatory approval. The top US-based maker, Flir Systems, has faced an up to weeks-long order backlog, forcing it to prioritize products for hospitals and other critical facilities.Amazon declined to confirm its purchase from Dahua but said its hardware complied with national, state and local law, and its temperature checks were to “support the health and safety of our employees, who continue to provide a critical service in our communities”.The company added it was implementing thermal imagers from “multiple” manufacturers, which it declined to name. These vendors include Infrared Cameras, which Reuters previously reported, and Flir, according to employees at Amazon-owned Whole Foods who saw the deployment. Flir declined to comment on its customers.“It’s troubling to learn that well-known American companies are continuing to turn a blind eye to companies that are fueling the Chinese Communist party’s brutal treatment of so many of their own people,” said the top Republican on the House foreign affairs committee, Michael McCaul, in reaction to the news.Dahua, one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally, said it does not discuss customer engagements and it adheres to applicable laws. Dahua is committed “to mitigate the spread of the Covid-19” through technology that detects “abnormal elevated skin temperature with high accuracy,” it said in a statement.The US Department of Commerce, which maintains the blacklist, declined comment. The FDA said it would use discretion when enforcing regulations during the public health crisis as long as thermal systems lacking compliance posed no “undue risk” and secondary evaluations confirmed fevers.Dahua’s thermal cameras have been used in hospitals, airports, train stations, government offices and factories during the pandemic. IBM placed an order for 100 units, and the automaker Chrysler placed an order for 10, one of the sources said. In addition to selling thermal technology, Dahua makes white-label security cameras resold under dozens of other brands such as Honeywell, according to the research and reporting firm IPVM.Honeywell said some but not all its cameras were manufactured by Dahua, and it holds products to its cybersecurity and compliance standards. IBM and Chrysler’s parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles did not comment.The Trump administration added Dahua and seven other tech firms last year to the blacklist for acting against US foreign policy interests, saying they were “implicated” in “China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups”.More than 1 million people have been sent to camps in the Xinjiang region, the UN has estimated.Dahua has said the US decision lacked “any factual basis”. Beijing has urged the United States to remove the companies from the list.A provision of US law, scheduled to take effect in August, will also bar the federal government from starting or renewing contracts with a company using “any equipment, system, or service” from firms including Dahua “as a substantial or essential component of any system”.Amazon’s cloud unit is a major contractor with the US intelligence community, and it has been battling Microsoft Corp for an up to $10bn deal with the Pentagon.Top industry associations have asked Congress for a year-long delay because they say the law would reduce supplies to the government dramatically, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said last week that policies clarifying the implementation of the law were forthcoming.The coronavirus has infected staff from dozens of Amazon warehouses, ignited protests over allegedly unsafe conditions and prompted unions to demand site closures. Temperature checks help Amazon stay operational, and the cameras – a faster, socially distant alternative to forehead thermometers – can speed up lines to enter its buildings. Amazon said the type of temperature reader it uses varied by building.To see if someone has a fever, Dahua’s camera compares a person’s radiation with a separate infrared calibration device. It uses face detection technology to track subjects walking by and make sure it is looking for heat in the right place.An additional recording device keeps snapshots of faces the camera has spotted and their temperatures, according to a demonstration of the technology in San Francisco. Optional facial recognition software can fetch images of the same subject across time to determine, for instance, whom a virus patient may have been near in a line for temperature checks.Amazon said it was not using facial recognition on any of its thermal cameras. Civil liberties groups have warned the software could strip people of privacy and lead to arbitrary apprehensions if relied on by police. US authorities have also worried that equipment makers like Dahua could hide a technical “back door” to Chinese government agents seeking intelligence.In response to questions about the thermal systems, Amazon said in a statement: “None of this equipment has network connectivity, and no personal identifiable information will be visible, collected or stored.’”Dahua made the decision to market its technology in the United States before the FDA issued the guidance on thermal cameras in the pandemic.

In an interview with MSNBC, he likened pushback to his presidential run to “anti-American” voter suppression.“This is about democracy, this is about representative government,” he said. “The idea that we’re going to tell people ‘we can’t have another choice on the ballot because it might upset one or the other candidate’, that’s ridiculous.”First elected to Michigan’s third congressional district in the 2010 amid the rise of the conservative grassroots movement that solidified into the rightwing Tea Party wing of the Republican party, aimed at disrupting business as usual on Capitol Hill.The son of a refugee father and immigrant mother immediately earned the ire of more moderate Republican colleagues with disagreements over foreign intervention by the US and surveillance of the public.“The two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions,” he wrote at the time.Meanwhile today’s Freedom Caucus members are known as some of the president’s most loyal supporters. Trump weighed in, sarcastically noting Amash “would make a wonderful candidate”.“Especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat,” Trump tweeted. “He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway.”The congressman faces a tough re-election, with several Republicans running against him.“There are millions of Americans who aren’t represented by either Donald Trump or Joe Biden, who aren’t represented by the Republicans or the Democrats,” he added. “And those Americans deserve a choice on the ballot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00151ee4568ac0c19cd16adcb53f8297c8dc0232/15_58_1404_842/master/1404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5bf3f067335e773406dd8bfd66eb6a2","title":"are you planning to mark a special occasion during lockdown","story":"If you are preparing for a big life event in the next fortnight, our photographer would like to capture the moment – from a safe distance Lockdown has wreaked havoc on our social lives.

The twist is that because producers can’t access people’s homes due to physical distancing, the crew are strapping cameras to the celebrity’s pets and sending the animals in to do the filming.The show’s announcement – which immediately led to it being dubbed ‘Through the Catflap’ and ‘Beagle’s About’ – comes amid warnings that broadcasters are at risk of running out of high-quality original television programmes due to the coronavirus pandemic.Global television production ground to a halt in mid-March, destroying long-planned shooting schedules and leading to warnings that viewers will notice a lack of material on-screen for years to come. EastEnders, already broadcasting on a reduced schedule, is at risk of running out of new episodes by the summer, while this autumn’s Strictly Come Dancing could be filmed without a studio audience.In response the industry is now seeking programmes that can be filmed while abiding by physical distancing rules – prompting talk of sending keen young actors, directors, and crew into long-term quarantine in order to restart filming and keep popular shows on air and the nation entertained. New series of long-running BBC shows such as The Apprentice, Top Gear, and Dragons’ Den are also set to be delayed.Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programming, said the pandemic and the prospect of months of lockdown will inevitably force his channel to seek out projects that are easier to film in a world with reduced movement – and reduced budgets.This could mean “smaller casts, or more contained precincts, or involve younger casts” he told a virtual session of the Edinburgh TV festival conducted on YouTube. Although his team pushed to finish filming on some projects in early March as it became apparent that the lockdown would shut down production – meaning they can now be edited remotely for broadcast – other programmes were less lucky.The result is that big Channel 4 programmes such as The Great British Bake Off have been delayed indefinitely, while production of some high-end scripted dramas were pulled off air mid-shoot. This raises questions about whether the original footage will have to be scrapped even if production can be resumed many months later.“There isn’t scope to be making drama for quite a few months,” said Katz, suggesting there may be an increased need to rely on archive footage as he announced new commissions such as Ramadan in Lockdown and Sex Tips in Isolation. He added that this posed a problem for broadcasters as audiences are desperate to watch shows that don’t involve people trapped at home: “This craving for escapism is only going to get greater.”His comments echo those made by Piers Wenger, head of BBC drama commissioning, who said on Tuesday that one option under consideration by the corporation is “quarantining actors and crew in order to allow actors to interact in the same space”.British-filmed productions are likely to be prioritised over foreign productions. Wenger said the BBC was also looking at ways to film new episodes while observing physical distancing rules by looking to the Australian television industry: “There are ways of cheating, actors being close enough together to act in a scene. Neighbours is experimenting with different ways of shooting while social distancing is in place.”As a result the cost of unloved already-produced shows has suddenly jumped, with the likes of Netflix keen to use its chequebook to buy up programmes that had been filmed pre-lockdown but are available for purchase in certain territories. ITV Studios, which makes programmes for many broadcasters, has been advertising shows it made for audiences in the US and China which they hope to sell to broadcasters elsewhere in the world.There is also the risk that commercial broadcasters, who are currently seeing record-high viewing figures with record-low advertising income as the economy contracts, could be left with major gaps in their autumn and winter schedules. Channel 4 has already had to make enormous cuts to its programming budget in order to avoid financial collapse.Charlotte Moore, BBC director of content, told an Edinburgh TV festival session that audiences were tiring of programmes that look like they were filmed on videoconference calls and are instead yearning for more substantive and slick programmes.“We’re very keen not everything is made on Zoom,” she said. “At the moment people are enjoying ‘we’re all in it together’ and seeing inside everyone’s house … But there’s also a massive appetite for all the flashy shows.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 15 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.

Here are some answers.The “official” death toll, if you go by what the UK government present to the public every day in Downing Street, is 26,097 deaths as of 5pm 28 April. Until Wednesday this figure focused solely on people who have died in hospital, however an additional 3,811 deaths in care homes and the community have now been included. Deaths in all settings where a positive Covid-19 test has been recorded by Public Health England will now be reflected in the figures each day, according to the government. However, even this doesn’t appear to be entirely straightforward. Figures recorded by the Office for National Statistics and the Care Quality Commission show at least 4,996 deaths were recorded in care homes in the two weeks to 24 April – a toll which is clearly at odds with the government’s latest figures, as many of the deceased will not have been tested. In addition to this, the key government figure is lagging, as it can take days or weeks for some deaths to be counted. Clearly this widely circulated figure, even when deaths in the community are included, is an undercount.The figures to date do not show deaths in care homes are exceeding those in hospitals in England and Wales but it’s possible the impact of the virus is on different trajectories in different places.There are more than 15,000 care homes in England and 3,096 deaths were recorded in care homes in England and Wales as of 17 April. At the same point there were 14,796 deaths in hospitals – a far higher death toll.Early models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) indicated that the UK could have the worst death toll in Europe, with as many as 66,000 deaths. While that figure now looks overblown based on the model’s daily death toll, it’s still possible the UK could emerge as one of the countries with the highest number of Covid-19 fatalities in Europe.The 26,097 deaths that we know of in the UK puts it ahead of France, which includes care home deaths in its total, and on a par with Spain when comparing the cumulative total, something the government has been keen to distract from by talking about deaths per capita.On that basis the UK currently has 38.4 deaths per 100,000 people, which places it high above Germany which has recorded 7.5 deaths per 100,000 people, on a par with France where the rate is 36.3 per 100,000, but behind Belgium with 63.3 deaths per 100,000. However comparing deaths per capita has limited uses as it does not follow that a larger population should lead to more deaths. If countries are locked down early, testing is in place and hospitals have capacity to treat patients, the spread of the virus can be contained and the death toll should be lower.Figures on excess deaths from EuroMOMO also indicate England could have the highest proportion of excess deaths when compared to European nations.Aside from the problems around how deaths are counted and when, there are further concerns about the accuracy of the Covid-19 death toll. The final figures will depend on Covid-19 being mentioned on the death certificate, which is not as simple as it sounds.Following the Coronavirus Act 2020 medical practitioners in England and Wales do not have to test the deceased to confirm they had Covid-19, they only have to be satisfied that the patient had symptoms consistent with the virus. This means the final official death toll will depend in some part on the discretion of thousands of doctors as to whether Covid-19 is recorded on the death certificate. This could lead to an under count in the number of fatalities rather than an over count, which is one of the reasons we look at excess deaths.Excess deaths are the number of deaths above what we might expect to see at this point in the year. They are a good indicator of how many people may have died as a result of Covid-19 - directly, with the virus on the death certificate, and indirectly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a13889b6df7c7e6892e29f4489e36a7fce4d0ee/0_1320_2838_1703/master/2838.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5babc4d9e79c597e40ec3b79c19868","title":"social bubbles of small groups could be early step out of lockdown","story":"Boris Johnson believed to be looking at plan to let people add close family to their households“Social bubbles” allowing people to mix with a fixed small group of family and friends could be a part of easing the lockdown, Downing Street has hinted, but experts warned that tougher isolation and quarantining measures may be needed at the same time as any relaxation of restrictions.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman signalled No 10 was open to the idea on Wednesday, saying it was “very alive to the issue of social isolation and the need for mental wellbeing”.His comments reflected the priority the government is putting on trying to find a way for people to see close family, believing that is the aspect of the lockdown that people are finding toughest.Under the social bubble proposal, people would be allowed to combine their household with one or two others, up to a maximum of 10 people. A cautious version of the plan would probably mean that the vulnerable such as the over-70s and those with underlying health conditions would be advised to keep isolating and not merge with other households.However, experts are concerned that the government needs to more rigorously quarantine new cases of coronavirus at the point that it moves to the “test, track and isolate” phase advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO).Ministers have already conceded the need for mass testing and an army of contact tracers, after abandoning that strategy of containment early in the epidemic. They now talk about the need for “a test, track and trace” policy.But critics said they are making a mistake by failing to talk about a tougher isolation response, which in some other countries involves a longer, 14-day period of quarantining for confirmed cases and asking some to quarantine in state facilities. China has even made forcible quarantining mandatory, although that is unlikely to occur in the UK.At No 10’s daily press briefing, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England suggested the government could look at relocating care home residents sick with coronavirus to the largely empty Nightingale hospitals as part of the strategy to bolster quarantining in the future. However, they said it would have to be done carefully and was only one of the options under review.The UK may also consider asking those with confirmed coronavirus to quarantine for longer than the seven days currently required.Speaking in the House of Lords, James Bethell, a health minister, signalled this was actively under review. “The question of isolation remains one for which we are reviewing our advice. We are in constant contact with other countries to learn more about best practice,” he said.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the UK ought to require a 14-day period of isolation for those with symptoms, in line with the WHO. “At the moment it probably doesn’t matter a great deal, because we’re not trying to stop every transmission, but if we manage to get to the point where there are very low numbers in the community, letting people out before 14 days is a significant source of concern,” he said.Under such circumstances, he said, more thought needs to be given to increasing compliance. “Once we’re back to small numbers we cannot afford to allow rogue citizens to do what they like. There are undoubtedly people in the UK who ignore guidance. Not many, but some. A person like that could ultimately be responsible for going into a care home and introducing the infection, causing 20-30 residents to die over the next month. We’ve got to take that seriously.”Another expert, Devi Sridhar, the global public policy chair at the University of Edinburgh, said the government could consider recommending isolation outside the home if confirmed cases live with vulnerable people.“‘Test, trace, isolate’ only works if each of those components are included,” she said. “There needs to be work in tandem across these three areas including on how incentives are created for people to isolate at home for 14 days or alternative housing arrangements if they live with elderly or vulnerable iniduals.”No 10 has repeatedly talked about the possibility that lockdown restrictions could be both loosened in some areas and tightened in other areas, as the government seeks a balance between returning to normal life and trying to avoid a second peak of the virus.Priti Patel, the home secretary, signalled tougher quarantining requirements on new arrivals in the UK are also under consideration when she appeared before the home affairs committee on Wednesday. Further restrictions could include asking people to wear face coverings in enclosed public places, which is already recommended in Scotland.Social bubbles is one of the possible ways of easing restrictions, but other possibilities include letting some shops reopen, encouraging people to go back to work with staggered start times and social distancing, and reopening schools with smaller class sizes and different opening hours.Asked on Wednesday whether the government was considering social bubbles, Johnson’s spokesman said: “We have said there’s extensive work going on in government to look at the next phase of the coronavirus response and also talked about how we could relax measures in some areas and toughen them in others. We are also very alive to the issue of social isolation and the need for mental wellbeing, as people help us to deal with the spread of this pandemic.“But in terms of specific details, you will have to wait until such a time as we have full medical and scientific advice, and we’re ready to set out what happens next. We will have to take decisions based on the scientific evidence and guided by the fact we are not going to do anything which could lead to the virus being able to spread exponentially again.”A Whitehall source told the  that it was one of many options under consideration and not one of the most outlandish but “there are lots of details that would have to be worked out before it is workable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97c1cf8825f4cc322e5370dc9cbda021941cddf4/0_36_3835_2301/master/3835.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bf783ee2f88f96a9eb7fa4caf62ac36b","title":"uk turned down offer of 10000 coronavirus tests a day four weeks ago","story":"The UK government turned down an opportunity to buy tens of thousands of potentially “game-changing” coronavirus tests from an award-winning British scientist just days after Matt Hancock pledged to hit 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.As the UK looks set to miss its target, the  can reveal that the government spurned an offer nearly four weeks ago to purchase vast quantities of US-approved home testing kits from a firm carrying out tests for the US air force, and the states of Florida and Alaska.The California-based company, Curative, offered to supply 50,000 saliva tests a week immediately, with the potential to increase this to 50,000 tests a day. On the day of the offer, 4 April, the UK had capacity to do just 15,499 tests a day and was only testing 8,651 people a day – far lower than other European nations such as Germany.The missed opportunity comes as the UK remains under severe strain due to an apparent lack of its ability to pursue a ‘“test and trace” strategy. Experts have said the UK should not end the lockdown without developing a clear strategy for stamping out the virus through mass testing.On Monday, the latest day for which figures are available, only 43,453 tests were carried out on 29,000 people, while the daily capacity of 73,400 remains well below the target of 100,000, which the government has pledged to hit by Thursday. The government can currently only provide 5,000 home-testing kits a day, but said it is “ramping up” this capacity.The Curative test, which has been approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency (FDA), is less invasive and easier to use than the nasal swabs currently favoured in the UK as they only require a saliva sample from inside the mouth, rather than deep in the back of the throat or nose.The two-minute test is self-administered and can be used at home without supervision, removing the need for potential Covid-19 victims to drive to testing facilities. It also lifts some of the strain on NHS staff, who are required to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) to oversee the current tests. The results are analysed in the US and emailed within 72 hours, Curative said.Early studies in the US, including one by Yale University, have found the saliva test to be as accurate - if not more so - than the nasal swab test and some scientists have hailed it as “game-changing”.Curative is rapidly expanding its testing in the US and currently provides tests for the US air force as well as the states of Florida and Alaska, and the city of Los Angeles. It says it conducts nearly a quarter of all testing in California.Philip Beales, a professor at the University College London Institute of Child Health, who has been helping to coordinate the efforts of UK testing firms, said saliva tests such as those provided by Curative “really could get us out of this epidemiological nightmare”.The so-called “next-gen” saliva test was developed in just 10 days earlier this year by Curative, which is run by 25-year-old Fred Turner, who won the EU’s contest for young scientists in 2013.The Yorkshire-born scientist was named UK young engineer of the year in the same year when, aged 17, he built a DNA machine from his bedroom to discover whether he had the “ginger gene”, after merciless teasing from his schoolmates about why his brother had red hair and he had brown hair. He turned his focus to the coronavirus when the pandemic took hold in January.Turner’s company contacted the UK government to offer its tests on 4 April, two days after Hancock’s 100,000-tests-a-day pledge. It received a brief reply from an unnamed official three days later to say the government was not interested because Curative’s test was “undifferentiated against the existing portfolio of tests”.However, the response has caused confusion because the UK is not thought to have any of the next-gen saliva tests, as officials have focused on the nasopharyngeal swabs.Labour’s Bill Esterson, the shadow international trade minister, said: “The government could have hit its 100,000 target weeks ago. Curative gave the government the scientific evidence needed to show they met the specification on 4 April. It makes no sense that the government dismissed them out of hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:At least 227,644 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 3,193,961 confirmed infection shave been recorded worldwide.South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The KCDC reported four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247.US president Donald Trump said that coronavirus has “upset very badly” the US trade deal with China, and that China “will do anything they can to have me lose in 2020” in an interview with Reuters. Trump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said.Three months after it closed due to the coronavirus crisis, Beijing’s sprawling Forbidden City will reopen, in the latest signal that the country has brought the disease under control. The imperial palace sitting across Tiananmen Square was shut down on 25 January as authorities closed tourist attractions and took other extraordinary measures to contain the virus, including locking down an entire province.Japan’s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as “severe”.While a Chinese trial demonstrated no “significant clinical benefits” to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a “clear-cut” effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci.Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said.

In one of the poorest districts in Europe, a stronghold of the local mafia, there appears no light at the end of the tunnel despite Italy being set to begin its route out of lockdown from next week.Unemployment skyrocketed in the Zen – built in the 1960s as the city’s Zona Esione Nord and falling into dilapidation in the decades after – when retailers were forced to close in order to contain the spread of Covid-19.“It’s easy to say ‘stay at home’ when you have a spacious apartment and a job waiting for you when it’s all over,” says Rosi Pensato, 43, a Zen resident who is unemployed with four children to feed. “It’s easy to say we’re all in this together when your bank account will get you through the next several months. Put yourselves in our position. We were already poor before Covid-19, and at the end of it we’ll be even poorer.”Designed at the end of the 1960s by Italian architect Vittorio Gregotti, a key figure in 1970s postmodernism and architect of Barcelona’s 1992 Olympic stadium who died in March after contracting coronavirus, the Zen was inspired by the idea of a walled city. Alongside apartments, theatres and workspaces were planned but Gregotti’s dreams for a visionary quarter were soon dashed as many of the blocks were left unfinished and the neighbourhood transformed into a citadel of petty crime and one of the most formidable strongholds of the Cosa Nostra.“Many people living in the Zen get by in the grey economy,” says Ivano Abbruzzi, 48, president of Albero della Vita Foundation, an anti-poverty NGO that fights poverty in Italy’s most depressed areas. “Since the government-imposed lockdown, these people have been short on money and food. There are families that struggle to put dinner on the table, and whose kids – accustomed to eating their only meal at the school canteen – are in tears now that the schools have closed.”Since the quarantine, Rosi’s cupboard has often been empty. She, her unemployed husband and their four children are getting by on welfare benefits of about €500 a month.“I haven’t been ashamed to knock on my neighbour’s door and ask for some flour or pasta,” she says. “Our flat is very small and my kids play in 10 square metres. In such a small space, the days never end.”As Italy’s lockdown seems to be winding down, the inhabitants of the Zen are full of rage and desperation – an extreme example of some of Europe’s most destitute areas on the edge of a nervous breakdown.Many supermarkets near the Zen are being patrolled by police after attempted raids by some residents. In late March, a hamburger chain announced that it was suspending home delivery in the Zen after a driver was mugged there.“If the state doesn’t step in to help these families, the mafia will take its place,” says the mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, whose administration has already issued subsidies for 3,000 families in the city. “Mafia bosses are poised to capitalise on people’s needs and to stoke the fire of the crisis.”The shopping vouchers are however insufficient to cover all the families running out of cash. The brother of a Cosa Nostra boss was reported by the newspaper La Repubblica to be distributing food to the poor in the Zen and journalists have since not been welcome. Mafia lookouts on scooters provide surveillance when the police or other intruders enter the neighbourhood.Despite the lockdown, drug dealers await customers as Neapolitan pop music – Italy’s answer to gangsta rap – blasts out of apartment windows. Business is bad for them, too, but the vast profits made over the years will allow them to weather the storm.Caterina Santoro, 24, born and raised in the Zen, does not have such a cushion but because of the widespread crime in the district, continues to be perceived with prejudice. With three children, she and her husband live with her mother and brother. Her youngest child, two, suffers from a heart ailment. Because of the coronavirus emergency, all hospital checkups have been put on hold for the child.“People see us as criminals,’’ says Caterina. ‘‘They tend to forget that we are not all drug dealers or mafiosi. They forget how poor we are. In the best of times, my husband brings home €400 a month. I can’t even discuss the future. People here are having trouble feeding their kids.”The future in the Zen looks grim, a time bomb that could explode by year’s end as the recovery of retailers is less than certain.“The problem is Italy’s chronic inefficiency in combating poverty,” says Abbruzzi. “We were slow to react when the financial crisis of 2007-2008 hit, after which poverty trebled across the country. Experts now agree that the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy will be even worse. Once again, we are slow to respond. Just imagine the consequences in a neighbourhood like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

Photograph: Paul FaithGettyAFPThey are after the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed that the Government was considering following the lead of other countries across the EU in altering its advice on face masks and asking people to consider wearing face coverings when they are out and about.Yes, the Taoiseach drew a distinction between face masks and coverings because he wanted to make sure that “face masks are preserved and protected for our healthcare staff and those who need them the most”.Would I have to wear a covering at all times? No, the idea is that masks or other face coverings will be worn in places where social distancing is difficult. That includes public transport and in enclosed indoor spaces. Many countries in Europe and Asia have made masks mandatory while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises the wearing of basic masks including those made of cloth for all people in public spaces.What is the World Health Organisation saying?It is reviewing its stance on an ongoing basis. In the past it has warned that masks can actually facilitate the spread of the coronavirus, especially if used incorrectly.But are masks effective in stopping the spread of the virus?The jury is still out. A growing number of scientists say that while basic face masks may not prevent infection for the wearer they may make it more difficult for people who have the virus to spread it.How can masks facilitate the spread of the virus?In several ways. They can create complacency and see people relaxing when it comes to proper hand hygiene and social distancing. And masks can also encourage people to touch their faces more frequently. And far too many people have no idea how they should actually be worn and how they should be put on and taken off.How should they be worn?The wearer should work under the assumption that there is virus on their hands. People need to make sure their hands are washed properly before putting the mask on. The masks have to be attached in a way that is comfortable so they don’t need to be touched or adjusted. Before a mask is taken off, the wearer should wash their hands. The mask must be disposed of carefully and then hands have to be washed again. Masks should not be removed so they can talk, eat or smoke. They need to cover the nose and mouth and they should not be left dangling around the neck. Disposable masks should not be used for more than four to six hours.Where can I buy masks?Even before there was a case of coronavirus in Ireland, panic-buying of face masks in pharmacies and hardware shops had led to shortages across the country. Wholesale prices soared by as much as 500 per cent. Availability has improved in recent weeks with many pharmacies - and corner shops - now stocking them. Prices can vary from less than €2 a mask to closer to €4.That seems expensive? Are pharmacies ripping people off?Probably not. Masks are one of the most sought after items in the world right now. Supply is limited and manufacturers and wholesalers are charging a premium. So before you give out about your local pharmacy charging €2.50 for a mask, ask yourself how much they might have paid for it.What about home made masks? There is definitely a place for them. There are all manner of YouTube tutorials showing people how to make them. They may help in slowing transmission but as with other masks, it is important they are used correctly. Put them on with clean hands, don’t touch your face or the mask while it is on. And then when you are ready to take it off, wash it immediately at a temperature of at least 60 degrees.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241230.1588226064!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one hse nurse redeployed for every five private nursing homes data reveal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome 85 nurses and 120 healthcare assistants had been deployed as of last Friday, according to data released by the HSE to Fianna Fáil. File photograph: GettyNeither private nor public medical staff have been redeployed to nursing homes at scale, new figures reveal, despite ongoing staffing difficulties in the sector. Some 85 nurses and 120 healthcare assistants had been deployed as of last Friday, according to data released by the HSE to Fianna Fáil. Meanwhile, delays over contractual negotiations stalled the redeployment of home-help staff under a deal announced between private home-help companies and the HSE in early April. The level of home-help staff taking up shifts in nursing homes has been constrained, it is understood, after delays and contractual negotiations slowed roll-out of the scheme.About 100 shifts were covered by home-help staff from the private sector during April, with sources indicating that at minimum, 2,000 shifts a month could be covered by the deal between the HSE and home-help companies. Staffing issues in the State’s nursing homes will become more acute in coming days and weeks as widespread testing in the settings last week revealed many previously undiagnosed, asymptomatic cases among staff, said Nursing Homes Ireland (NHI) chief executive Tadhg Daly. “From our point of view there are significant challenges in respect of staffing due to the fact many staff are out as a result of testing positive, many of them asymptomatic,” he said. According to figures released to Fianna Fáil, some 400 hospital patients had been released into nursing homes during the early stages of the crisis but only those who were symptomatic were tested. Mr Donnelly said it was “disappointing to see that the total numbers being deployed are small. While thankfully there are nursing homes that don’t require support right now, there are many nursing homes with very high levels of nursing and other staff out sick or self-isolating. At the same time, the private hospitals are currently at 33 per cent capacity. Given that, it seems like there should be staff available from this sector for deployment.”The deal governing the redeployment of private sector home-help staff was only finally signed off on Tuesday, despite being announced on April 2nd, The  has learned. While some redeployments have taken place, the scale has been limited as issues around training, record keeping and indemnification delayed final agreement. Home-support servicesAbout 600 private home-help workers have indicated an interest in being redeployed, it is understood. Due to the scaling back of some home-support services caused by the crisis, and the fact that many thousands of older people with lower priority needs cocooning, spare capacity has emerged in the home-help sector. In a memo to NHI staff issued on Tuesday, member organisations were told that a framework agreement governing secondment of private sector home-help groups to nursing homes had been reached. A HSE spokeswoman confirmed the deal had been signed, with the HSE funding it initially “with costs to be recouped from the residential unitsnursing homes in due course”.Joseph Musgrave, chief executive of Home and Community Care Ireland, the trade body for private home-help operators, said “the first priority of our members is to support vulnerable people in the community. We will continue to support our partners in the nursing home sector, and we hope to get an indication of how many staff are needed to allow everyone to plan effectively.”Elsewhere, a Siptu spokesman said that grant-funded home-help groups where its members are working have not seen significant redeployment to nursing homes.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA majority of people want the Government to go slowly in lifting the restrictions in place and remain nervous, particularly about the risk of a second surge of the Covid-19 virus, according to new research by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).The clamour for a quick lifting of restrictions is coming from a “vocal minority”, according to Dr Pete Lunn, head of the ESRI’s behavioural science unit, who led the study team. “A comfortable majority of people want to go slowly and are quite scared,” he said.The study, commissioned by the Government as part of its monitoring of public attitudes, was conducted late last week and involved asking different groups of people about their reactions to various scenarios in which restrictions were eased.While final results are still being compiled, Dr Lunn said it was clear that a majority of people, while they want to see progress in lifting restrictions, want the Government to move “slowly and carefully” and remain concerned about their personal safety. In particular, the study picked up “very significant worry about the risk of a second surge of the virus”. Many will also be slow to return to being more active even if restrictions are lifted. There is a minority who take the opposite view and have been vocal in putting the case for lifting restrictions, according to Dr Lunn.Government decisionThe study will be examined by a sub-group of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and is likely to be one of the pieces of evidence feeding into the Government decision at the end of the week on how to proceed. The ESRI has also been compiling tracking data on people’s compliance with the restrictions put in place. Dr Lunn said about 15-20 per cent of people say they have become less scrupulous in following the regulations. However, about 80 per cent say they are still following the rules more or less to the letter.It was clear, said Dr Lunn, that for the vast bulk of people the regulations were still guiding their daily activities. A bit more traffic on the roads or people outside had led to speculation that people were getting tired of the restrictions and non-compliance was on a significant scale, he said. However, this was being driven by people judging what they could see, he said, and “we can’t see people staying inside in their houses”.People realised there was a trade-off involved in the decisions to come, he said, and recognised the economic and social costs, but felt that the balance should still be towards caution.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4240420.1588138030!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"revealed phased plan to exit coronavirus lockdown in ireland may see cafes reopen by midsummer","story":"The Chief Medical Officer of the HSE Tony Holohan has said keeping restrictions in place is required before making any changes on May 5th.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireCafes and restaurants could reopen by the middle of the summer, with people allowed travel within Ireland for holidays by late summer, under plans being discussed to gradually lift the coronavirus lockdown. The  understands the early stages of plans being discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would see retailers, cafes and restaurants reopen on a limited basis, with the tourist industry also reopening on a limited basis in the mid-stages. The phases are broken down as: initial phase, early phase stage one, early phase stage two, middle phases and late phases. The latter two phases could be broken down into more stages.Initial drafts of the plan spaced the phases out in periods between early May and September, although no dates are on the latest draft being considered by NPHET.Any easing of restrictions is entirely dependent on efforts to tackle the virus, and progress through the phases will not happen unless a number of key targets are met. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris told the Cabinet on Tuesday that there are “no indications that disease levels are low enough to enable any easing of restrictions” when the current phase of lockdown ends after May 5th. Officials on Tuesday night conceded delays in ramping up testing capacity for Covid-19 are a factor in the likely decision not to lift lockdown restrictions at the end of this week.An inability to meet the target of providing 100,000 tests a week “feeds into” the stance of officials in relation to the lifting of restrictions, according to the head of the Government’s expert advisory group on the disease, Dr Cillian de Gascun.Weekly testingThe long-promised 100,000 weekly tests target is a critical step to help track infection rates as lockdown measures are relaxed in order to assess whether they are leading to new Covid-19 cases.The primary parameters influencing NPHET’s decision would be trends in case numbers, deaths and intensive care unit admissions, he said. Current laboratory capacity stands at 60,000 tests a week, but this would increase to 70,000 next week.Sources stressed that each phase of the plan, expected to be announced later this week, would contain a “menu” of actions that could be chosen. Specific actions could also be moved between phases. Social distancing will continue to apply through all phases.Under the latest draft, the first phase would allow the over-70s who are cocooning out to walk on a “no touch” basis allow outdoor workers such as builders and gardeners return to work allow a maximum of four people not from the same household gather outside while obeying social distancing recommence some restricted classes for Leaving Cert students potentially increase the distance people can travel outside their home for exercise from 2km to 5km or 10km allow retailers such as DIY and garden centres reopen and allow retail outlets deemed essential in an earlier round of restrictions – such as banks, repair shops, optometrists and others – open again.Family units Although flagged by some on NPHET in recent days, the broadening of family units is not seen as likely in the first phase. Other measures – such as the number of people allowed gather together – are also expected to be scaled up throughout the phases.The next phase – “early phase stage one” – would allow small retailers reopen by allowing only a limited number of staff and customers on the premises. Restrictions on travel away from the home could increase to 20km. Open marts could also recommence. “Early stage phase two” would see cafes and restaurants reopen, as long as social distancing and strict cleaning rules apply. The so-called “middle phases” would see the tourism industry – hotels, hostels, caravan parks – reopen on a limited occupancy basis. Travel restrictions would be further eased to allow people travel outside their regions. Any holidays or breaks should be taken by family units only.The “later phases” would see the wider reopening of the economy – such as pubs and offices – again if social distancing is implemented. Schools would also reopen in September, again complying with social distancing. Mass gatherings of over 5,000 people have already been effectively cancelled until September. Guidance around these events is unlikely to be provided until much later in the year, similar to family events such as weddings. Cocooning is also expected to last for the foreseeable future, until vaccines or treatments for Covid-19 are found.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241298.1588192456!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools and colleges unlikely to reopen until september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, and nurses Leona Byrne and Sarah Totney at the Covid-19 Community Assessment Hub in DCU in Dublin.

The latter two phases could be broken down into more stages.While the latest drafts of the document do not specify dates, earlier drafts spaced the phases out in periods between early May and September.Creches would open in the middle stages for the children of essential workers, but would not open for other workers until the late phases and on a staged basis – such as one day a week from the start.Hairdressers would also not open until the middle phases. It is understood that this would be possible only where protective equipment is available.Playgrounds, it is understood, would open in early phase stage two, while outdoor walks and parks where people are not stationary, are moving and can respect social distancing would reopen in the initial phase.Commercial and social lifeTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the daily numbers of deaths, new cases and ICU patients associated with coronavirus suggest the conditions are not yet suitable to lift the restrictions on commercial and social life. Restrictions imposed by the Government in an effort to stem the spread of coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, were introduced on March 28th and are due to last until at least May 5th. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Varadkar said it was “totally incorrect” to say that restrictions were not yet being lifted because the testing capacity was not where it needed to be.“Why we are not reopening at this stage is because of the high number of people in ICU who have Covid, the fact that the number of deaths being reported every day is still very high and the fact that we’re still seeing quite a lot of new cases every day,” he said.Mr Varadkar said a number of factors had to be taken into account and said these would be reviewed by Dr Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer, and NPHET on Friday.“I don’t think I’d be out of school by saying that those numbers just aren’t good enough yet. Maybe it’ll change significantly by Friday. But, as things stand, I don’t think we’re there yet.”On emerging Cabinet isions over the timing of the easing of restrictions, Mr Varadkar said he expected to hear different views from Ministers.“Any time you get 15 or 20 people in the room and ask for their views on something, you’re going to have different views. And if I wasn’t hearing different views from my Ministers on any issue, I would actually be quite worried because that would be a sign of groupthink or a sign that they are somehow afraid to express their opinions.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241710.1588227288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus south korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since february","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Buddhist believers wear masks as a preventive measure against the coronavirus, receive body temperature check as they arrive to attend a birthday of Buddha ceremony in South Korea on Thursday.

The death toll rose by one to 247, while 9,059 have been discharged.Of the total, 1,065 were imported cases, where more than 90 per cent were Koreans, according to a KCDC statement.\u0026nbspThe health authorities also concluded no local transmission occurred from a parliamentary election this month, where authorities took safety measures, including requiring voters to wear masks and plastic gloves when casting ballots.“Twenty-nine million voters participated in the April 15th parliamentary election ... Not one case related to the election has been reported during the 14 days of incubation period,” Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy, told a briefing.Mr Yoon thanked staff and voters, who disinfected polling stations across the country and maintained 1 metre (40 inches) distance between each other.\u0026nbspA clinical expert panel on Wednesday also concluded that recovered coronavirus patients who later test positive for the virus again were not “reactivated” or reinfected, but were false positives.The head of the committee said the false positives were due to technical limits of PCR testing. The country has so far reported 292 such cases. After grappling with the first major outbreak outside China, South Korea has largely managed to bring the outbreak under control without major disruptions with a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.EuropeSpain recorded 325 deaths overnight, against 301 the previous day, but health officials said the epidemic was evolving favourably ahead of a gradual easing of its lockdown next week.Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 323 on Wednesday, against 382 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new infections stood at 2,086, broadly stable from 2,091.AsiaChina reported four new coronavirus cases for April 29th, down from 22 a day earlier, data from the country’s health authority showed. All of the cases were imported, the National Health Commission said. It also reported 33 new asymptomatic cases over the day, up from 26 a day earlier.Thailand on Thursday reported seven new coronavirus cases but no new deaths, taking its tally to 2,954 cases while fatalities remained at 54 since the outbreak began in January. New daily infections have stayed in the single digits for four consecutive days.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Thursday he will consult with infectious disease experts on whether to extend a national state of emergency to contain coronavirus infections, as other nations begin to reopen from strict lockdowns. Mr Abe declared the nationwide state of emergency on April 16th to last through May 6th, and local media said the declaration will likely be extended for another month. The measures rely on persuasion for citizens to stay home and businesses to close as the country’s laws do not provide for an enforceable lockdown. There remain worrying signs that Japan’s low testing regime has undercounted many coronavirus cases. Japan has performed 1.3 coronavirus tests per 1,000 people, compared with 12 in South Korea and 18 in the United States, according to figures compiled by Our World in Data. Tokyo confirmed 47 new infections on Wednesday. Nationwide there have been 13,929 cases and 415 deaths, according to the health ministry, still far lower figures seen in the United States and Europe.AfricaThe number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A total of 354 new cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 5,350, and the number of fatalities spiked by 10 to 103.–Reuters, PA, Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, goCoronavirus latest news: Trump team hails experimental drug remdesivir, as experts urge cautionWatch: A tribute to Captain Tom Moore, our carers and key workersThe hidden joys of London\u0026#39s empty streetsComment: A mass breakdown over the limits of science has plunged us into post-Orwellian nightmareDonald Trump \u0026#39lambasts campaign manager\u0026#39 as polls show eroding support in key statesJuries could be reduced in size for first time since Second World War due to coronavirus pandemicBoris Johnson baby name odds: what will Carrie and the PM call their son?Boris Johnson becomes fourth Prime Minister in 170 years to have child in Downing Street\u0026#39They are the front line\u0026#39: Captain Tom Moore, hails NHS heroes as he completes £29m fundraiserRAF chief condemns Russia after two \u0026#39Cold War\u0026#39 bombers intercepted near ScotlandLife after lockdown: Spain to rely on local tourists as coronavirus wipes out summer tradeWatch: Captain Tom Moore\u0026#39s 100th birthday - how he inspired the nationComment: Boris and Carrie\u0026#39s new arrival reflects a growing spirit of optimismPriti Patel seeks new agreement with EU to return more Channel migrants to FranceDonald Trump accuses China of doing \u0026#39anything they can\u0026#39 to prevent his re-electionMeet Boris Johnson\u0026#39s children: a look at the Prime Minister\u0026#39s family treeDozens of bodies found in trucks outside New York funeral home amid coronavirus backlogBoris Johnson to dash hopes coronavirus lockdown will be lifted soonCaptain Tom Moore becomes a Colonel as MoD announces honorary promotion on 100th birthday We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc defends panorama show used labour activists criticise lack","story":"The BBC has defended a Panorama programme which used Labour activists to criticise the Government’s “scandalous” PPE provision to the NHS.The flagship current affairs programme featured doctors and nurses complaining about the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment, but failed to mention their political allegiances.Dr Sonia Adesara spoke of PPE shortages and said there was widespread concern that health workers will die from the covid-19 virus. The programme did not explain that she is a Labour activist who has shared a platform with Jeremy Corbyn and in 2018 stood unsuccessfully for selection to represent Labour in Boris Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.Another doctor, Irial Eno, daughter of the musician Brian Eno,  is a member of Docs Not Cops, which campaigns for free healthcare for migrants and works in solidarity with Together Against Prevent, a group “challenging the government’s Islamophobia in targeting all Muslims as potential terrorists”.The links were highlighted by the Guido Fawkes website. In response, the BBC suggested that some NHS Trusts “have discouraged health care workers from discussing the lack of PPE, so it is perhaps not surprising that those willing to speak out are more involved with campaigning around the NHS”.Other contributors included Dr Abhi Mantgani, a Labour-supporting GP from the Wirral who has posted on social media about the need to replace the Tory administration with a national unity caretaker government and Dr Asif Munaf, an A\u0026ampE doctor who has tweeted that “quite simply the Government have blood on their hands”.Libby Nolan, a South Wales nurse featured in the programme, was correctly described as a union representative. On her Twitter biography she calls herself a “nurse and constant agitator”, and is a supporter of Jeremy Corbyn.Only one contributor, Prof John Ashton, was labelled as a “long-standing critic of the Government”. The public health expert attacked the “breathtaking” lack of PPE stockpiling and said NHS workers and care workers were being made to work in unsafe conditions.He said of the Government: “They failed to get a grip, they took advice from too narrow a range of people, and when things continued to escalate out of control they started to spin the story to make out that actually they’d been following the science and everything they did made perfect sense. I think it’s disgraceful.”Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, criticised the Panorama report after it aired on Monday night. He said: “I’m not sure they were a fair and objective journalistic assessment of the situation but what we do have is constant focus on the realities of getting PPE to the frontline.”He said the Government has “been moving heaven and earth” to get sufficient PPE to the frontline in a “mammoth effort”. Defending the show, the BBC said: “Monday night’s Panorama was a rigorous, properly sourced investigation into the procurement and supply of PPE, which posed serious questions for the Government. It also included contributions from health professionals about their frontline experience.“The programme spoke to a range of interviewees, including public health policy experts, and those involved in the supply of PPE. Where it was relevant, we indicated that they had been vocally critical of the Government.“Some of those interviewed are members of a political party and some are not. We believe that if the doctors featured in Panorama feel their lives are at risk due to lack of proper PPE it is valid, and indeed in the public interest, for them to reflect on that experience, regardless of the political views they may or may not hold.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/men/2020/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000230242455_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRNkGBB_d4pk7ICRsNtCsAM.jpeg?imwidth=450\"","title":"boris year backbencher father via number 10 icu","story":"Boris Johnson on his return to work after spending three days in an ICU with covid-19Coronavirus Charity Appeal - compact puff to donate page - article embedAH. It’s a boy. He wasn’t lying about Britain’s Brexit baby boom, was he? As word came yesterday that Boris Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds had given birth to a healthy son at a London hospital, if felt like balm for the soul in these anxious times.Love him or loathe him, our Prime Minister can be accused of many things, but we can all agree that the news of a new baby’s arrival incontrovertibly adds to the gaiety of the nation. Even in lockdown.Mr Johnson, who missed PMQs on Wednesday afternoon, was said to have been by his 32-year-old fiancee\u0027s side throughout the labour in the early hours of the morning and thanked \u0027the fantastic NHS maternity team\u0027 who brought their son into the world. He then left Carrie’s side and returned to Downing Street to get back to the business of tackling a global pandemic.  Which is why on a more practical note, on behalf of the entire country can we ask that 55-year old Boris be excused from night feeds? Just for now. Seriously. We know it’s a bit of an ask given that Carrie’s the one who has just given birth, has also had Coronavirus and is a feminist and everything but for the sake of national unity (sanity), we think it’s the PM who could do with a lie-in.He’s had a bit of a 12 months you see. So much so, he once hid in a fridge. And that was before he bulldozed the red wall, got Brexit done, had the rozzers turn up to a noisy domestic and got admitted to intensive care.I know, right? Hard to keep track. So much has happened I think we probably need a recap. And so, with abject apologies to Solzhenitsyn: One Year In The Life of Alexander Boris de Pfeffel.Back in April 2019 Johnson was a backbencher having quit the Foreign Office in 2018 claiming that Theresa May’s Brexit proposals would relegate the UK to the status of a colony. On the upside (with constitutionally buoyant Boris there is always an upside) he was back in these pages as a weekly columnist, having first made his mark here in the 1980s.A year ago Britain’s biggest political headache was a group called Extinction Rebellion protesting against Ecocide. Boris’s response was to tell them to “lecture China instead.” What prescience. If only we had any inkling what China really had in store for the rest of the world. But that comes much later.By May, Theresa May announced that she would be standing down and Boris confirmed he would put himself forward in the Conservative Party leadership election. In June, events came thick and fast as he campaigned for the top job, pledging that he’d get Brexit done and that even though our trains never run on time, our departure from the EU would.That same month police were called to a late night ruckus at Carrie’s Camberwell flat by a neighbour who heard shouting and “banging”. No further action was taken although it was rumoured he stained her sofa with Malbec the fact this egregious crime against soft furnishings was not a DFS deal-breaker hinted at the seriousness of their relationship.Boris Johnson with Carrie Symonds, pictured last yearJuly 2019 saw Boris achieve his lifetime’s ambition of becoming Prime Minister. Against dreary failed marmalade exporter Jeremy Hunt who once forgot the nationality of his own wife (note to Jeremy: Chinese) Boris proved to be a charismatic shoo-in and easily won two thirds of votes from Tory party members.“We are going to energise the country,” he pledged. We are going to get Brexit done on 31 October.We are once again going to believe in ourselves, and like some slumbering giant we are going to rise and ping off the guy ropes of self doubt and negativity.A stirring reference to Gulliver, and not a bad description of Boris himself, bestriding the political pygmies of Opposition like a tousle-haired Colossus, spouting Latin non-sequiturs to anyone who would listen. Although maddeningly short on specifics, even his detractors recognised (and still do) that Johnson is a consummate communicator who possesses the common touch all the more baffling given his rarefied upbringing.Meanwhile far below the radar, his estranged wife, barrister Marina Wheeler QC was going through treatment for cervical cancer, something which she disclosed in a newspaper article the following month, August 2019. Wheeler, 55, is routinely described by the media as “mother of four of his children”, which sounds a bit odd, but is actually a carefully-constructed expression because nobody knows just how many offspring Boris has fathered out of wedlock as he refuses to say.But back to Boris’s rapscallion career. August 2019 saw him make the controversial decision to prorogue Parliament until October, which seemed like a really big deal back then. In the throes of a pandemic, not so much.Suffice to say it was all about Brexit and all those interminable amendments. In September Phillip Lee (who he?) defected to the Lib Dems. Bless. Remember them?Anyway, it all meant Boris lost his working majority in the House of Commons. Later that same day 21 MPs including Ken ‘Hush Puppy’ Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames had the whip withdrawn. Again, file under “stuff that happened ages ago”.On a jollier note, Dilyn the photogenically scruffy rescue Jack Russell Moved into Downing Street to play happy families with Boris and Carrie and steal the nation’s hearts.Boris Johnson with Dilyn after voting in the general election A welcome ersion before November’s interminable motions and defeats until a general election bill was passed. Or as Brenda from Bristol might have put it “You’re joking - not another one!”The next month campaigning started, Boris came under fire for not responding swiftly enough to floods that devastated communities and was castigated for his “outrageous” lack of concern. Aware of the optics, he hid inside a fridge in order to avoid a television interview with Piers Morgan. Fair dos, who wouldn’t need to cool off.Either way he won the election, pounded through Labour’s red wall and on December 12 took the biggest share of seats since 1987.“We did it,” he announced to great jubilation. “We pulled it off didn\u0027t we - we pulled it off, we broke the deadlock, we ended the gridlock, we smashed the roadblock.“We politicians have squandered the last three-and-a-half years in squabbles about Brexit, we have even been arguing about arguing, about the tone of our arguments,” he said. “I will put an end to all that nonsense and we will get Brexit done on time by the 31 January.”But before that, there would be time to pack in a quick holiday and Carrie and Boris flew Caribbean on the island of Mustique, just south of St Vincent and the Grenadines. By now Carrie was already pregnant and there was no inkling that the world was about to change cataclysmically. Official statements by the Chinese government to the World Health Organisation reported that the first confirmed case of a new strain of coronavirus passed over to humans had been diagnosed on 8 December. But the earliest case had been detected in Wuhan on 17 November a megacity of some 11 million souls in the province of Hubei most of us had never heard of.By January of this year Covid-19 had reached British shores two Chinese nationals from the same family staying at a hotel in York tested positive on 29th of the month.In February it was Boris’s personal life that made headlines on 18th he and Marina reached a financial settlement and their orce was finalised. Just over ten days later, on 29th February, Carrie announced on her Instagram page that she and Boris were engaged and expecting a baby “in early summer”.The next day the Coronavirus crisis was declared to be a major incident and Boris sought to steer a steady course through mounting waves of panic and fear. Affable jocular Boris was replaced by an altogether more sombre statesmanlike persona.His stilted, visibly uncomfortable air of solemnity was as alarming as his words at those first daily press briefings. As schools shut down for all but the children of key workers, restrictions on the general public tightened and the death toll rose daily, we looked to him as the nation’s leader.Gone was the joshing. The metaphors had been jettisoned. Ever the astute, adaptable politician, he was growing into his new role.By the end of March 2020 several members of his cabinet tested positive. Then we learned Boris had Covid-19 and was isolating in the flat above 11 Downing Street. Carrie was staying at their home in Camberwell, South London with Dilyn for company.Even in quarantine Boris continued to work – or to ‘keep buggering on’ as his hero Churchill would have put it. He looked increasingly ill and after his unkempt doorstep appearance at the Thursday Clap for Carers on 2 April, it came a shock but not a surprise when word came on Sunday 5 April that he had been driven by government car to St Thomas’s Hospital, just a few hundred metres away on the south side of the Thames.The official line was that this was a “precautionary” admission. But by Monday evening his condition worsened on the ward and he was taken into intensive care. The Queen was informed.Few people in public life are instantly identifiable by their first name. It bespeaks familiarity, respect, exasperation yes, but above all affection. That night people across the country of every political hue and none reported a sleepless night. The sense of horror was palpable.Would our ebullient Prime Minister, the great survivor, a genuine political life force succumb to Covid-19? Later he would tell us it could have gone either way.  Even his fiercest critics were swept up in a tsunami of sympathy.On April 12 Boris left hospital and was taken to Chequers to convalesce. With typical bullishness he made his return to work on April 26. Too early? Probably, but he won’t be told. And then yesterday Carrie was taken into hospital where she gave birth to a son. We know very few details, other than both are fine and the baby came early – how early has not been ulged.It has been confirmed that he will not taking paternity leave until later in the year in the grip of this terrible pandemic his country needs him. And he has resolved to be there for us.For now, all we can do is send our congratulations and warmest wishes to BoJo Maman Bebe as they begin their life together. Babies are a beacon of light in this dark hour.But, without wishing to sound liked the ultimate interfering mother-in-law Carrie, after the year he’s had, Boris needs his rest.You are not aloneCoronavirus latest news: Trump team hails experimental drug remdesivir, as experts urge cautionWatch: A tribute to Captain Tom Moore, our carers and key workersThe hidden joys of London\u0026#39s empty streetsComment: A mass breakdown over the limits of science has plunged us into post-Orwellian nightmareDonald Trump \u0026#39lambasts campaign manager\u0026#39 as polls show eroding support in key statesJuries could be reduced in size for first time since Second World War due to coronavirus pandemicBoris Johnson baby name odds: what will Carrie and the PM call their son?Boris Johnson becomes fourth Prime Minister in 170 years to have child in Downing Street\u0026#39They are the front line\u0026#39: Captain Tom Moore, hails NHS heroes as he completes £29m fundraiserRAF chief condemns Russia after two \u0026#39Cold War\u0026#39 bombers intercepted near ScotlandLife after lockdown: Spain to rely on local tourists as coronavirus wipes out summer tradeWatch: Captain Tom Moore\u0026#39s 100th birthday - how he inspired the nationComment: Boris and Carrie\u0026#39s new arrival reflects a growing spirit of optimismPriti Patel seeks new agreement with EU to return more Channel migrants to FranceDonald Trump accuses China of doing \u0026#39anything they can\u0026#39 to prevent his re-electionMeet Boris Johnson\u0026#39s children: a look at the Prime Minister\u0026#39s family treeDozens of bodies found in trucks outside New York funeral home amid coronavirus backlogBoris Johnson to dash hopes coronavirus lockdown will be lifted soonCaptain Tom Moore becomes a Colonel as MoD announces honorary promotion on 100th birthday We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"captain tom moore becomes colonel mod announces honorary promotion","story":"Captain Tom is to become Colonel Tom as the MoD has announced an honorary promotion for his 100th birthday. The Chief of the General Staff has promoted the veteran fundraiser and given him a new role. General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the head of the Army, has appointed Tom Moore as the first Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, in recognition of his incredible NHS fundraising feat. Two flypasts will take place by Army Air Corps helicopters and the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight on Capt Moore’s 100th birthday on Thursday.The appointment, which has been approved by Her Majesty The Queen, was made the day before Capt Tom’s centenary. The former soldier was informed in a letter presented by the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, the modern day descendents of his old unit, at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire.The Army Foundation College prepares 16 and 17-year-old junior soldiers for a career in the Army, teaching them the same values and standards that have proved the bedrock of Capt Tom’s life and amazing charity endeavour.As Honorary Colonel he will be invited to speak to junior soldiers at Harrogate, ensuring his incredible example is passed on to the next generation of soldiers.Captain Tom was also presented with his Second World War Defence Medal, which he sadly lost, ready in time for next week’s VE Day celebrations.The Yorkshire Regiment also presented him with their prestigious annual Regimental Medal, given to the inidual in the Yorkshire Regiment family who is considered to have made the greatest contribution in the last year.Earlier this week The Duchess of Cornwall paid tribute to Capt Tom\u0027s incredible feat of raising £29 million for the NHS. “I’m sure there’s a silver lining to everything and a lot of good is going to come out of this horrible, horrible time,” she said. “I think it’s bringing out the best in many people.”She described Capt Tom as a “wonderful man”.“That sort of thing makes you proud to be British doesn’t it,” she said.Both The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall have written to congratulate him on his achievements.Two birthday flypasts are planned for Thursday, one from the era of Capt Tom’s service, and also a flight of modern-day aircraft.A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast of a Spitfire and a Hurricane will be broadcast live on BBC Breakfast at approximately 8.20am.

Absolutely, yes.“No one wants to see people losing their jobs which is what would happen, but the reality is for the market at large, online has been getting bigger and bigger, with John Lewis at the vanguard.”He said 30 per cent of all retail was already online, adding that “for John Lewis that number was short of 50 per cent before Covid-19, although now it’s at 100 per cent”.Mr Hyman said: “The reality is, the retail world we are all moving into means every retailer needs fewer stores than it did before, including John Lewis, and not addressing this problem puts the rest of the business in jeopardy.”Shortly after arriving at John Lewis Partnership earlier this year, Dame Sharon\u0026nbspwarned the company was facing the most challenging period in its history.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Astronomers suggested it could be one of the brightest comets to fly past Earth in decades, promising a display visible with the naked eye.But soon after that, the comet got suddenly dimmer, leading to fears that it was in fact breaking apart. Images of the comet seemed to confirm that, with amateur astronomers sharing images that showed the object breaking into pieces.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe latest images were taken days ago by the Hubble Space Telescope, and show that the object has definitively broken up. In lieu of the spectacle in the sky that was expected in May, however, they also show the bright show the comet is putting on as it breaks up.“This is really exciting — both because such events are super cool to watch and because they do not happen very often. Most comets that fragment are too dim to see. Events at such scale only happen once or twice a decade,\u0026nbspsaid the leader of the one of the Hubble\u0026nbspteams responsible for the images, Quanzhi Ye, of the University of Maryland.Some of the pieces that can be seen in the image are as small as the size of a house. The whole object is thought to have been roughly the size of a football field.The Hubble team shared two images of the comet, taken days apart. They appear notably different – and astronomers are not quite sure where those differences come from.“Their appearance changes substantially between the two days, so much so that it\u0027s quite difficult to connect the dots,” said David Jewitt of UCLA, leader of the other Hubble team. “I don’t know whether this is because the inidual pieces are flashing on and off as they reflect sunlight, acting like twinkling lights on a Christmas tree, or because different fragments appear on different days.”Mile-wide asteroid flies past Earth in \u0027close approach\u0027, Nasa saysComet fragmentations are difficult to predict, and tend to happen very quickly, making it hard for astronomers to watch them as they take place. That also means that the science around such break-ups is limited, and it is hard to know why Atlas fragmented.Scientists hope that the images from Hubble and other observations could provide extra information about how the phenomenon happens. Astronomers suspect it might be the result of gas coming from ice inside of the comet, which spins the rock into pieces as it is thrown out.The comet is for the moment inside the orbit of Mars, about 150 million kilometres from Earth. It will come at its closest point to Earth on 23 May, when it will get as near as 115 million kilometres to us, before shooting off towards the Sun.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight inidually, said Mack.Dr Laura Bontempo, 50, an emergency medicine doctor wears her personal protective equipment she uses when she sees patients, while posing for a photograph after a nine-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moments have actually been separating families from patients, there is a no-visitor policy now and taking people away from their loved ones is very challenging, Bontempo said. I\u0027m used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It\u0027s very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That\u0027s the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time.Ernest Capadngan, 29, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing Covid patients die helpless and without their family members beside them, Capadngan said.Martine Bell, 41, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it\u0027s really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you\u0027re taking care of them. It\u0027s also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public, Bell said. It\u0027s very stressful, everyone is on edge. We don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming in next, or how sick they\u0027re going to be, or if we are going to get a whole bunch of people or if we\u0027re not going to get no one. It\u0027s a really stressful and just a completely unusual time for all of us.Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital. We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic. Said Martiniano. I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home.Tracey Wilson, 53, a nurse practitioner in an intensive care unit (ICU), poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn\u0027t come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him, Wilson said. There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we\u0027re not used to dealing with.Meghan Sheehan, 27, a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we\u0027ll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients\u0027 lives,  Sheehan said.Kimberly Bowers, 44, a nurse practitioner in an ICU, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn\u0027t able to be here with her, Bowers said. I think right now, it\u0027s just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next.Tiffany Fare, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works. One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a Covid patient, say goodbye over an iPad, rooms away. That was a tough one, I can\u0027t imagine how hard it would be to be saying goodbye, you can\u0027t see your loved one and then they\u0027re gone, Fare said. My team has been really great to me. We\u0027ve worked really well together and we\u0027ve really come together in this crisis. We don\u0027t really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it\u0027s been a journey but I think that\u0027s what is giving me hope.Dr Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift, outside the hospital where he works. Since it\u0027s a new virus, we don\u0027t have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don\u0027t have any starting place. I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.Cheryll Mack, 46, a registered nurse in the emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital where she works. The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people\u0027s lives. It has created a crisis, death in general.

I know what I\u0027m hearing from New York, I\u0027ve read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there\u0027s a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it\u0027s hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know, said Fischer.Julia Trainor, 23, a registered nurse at a surgical ICU, poses for a photograph after a 14-hour shift, outside the hospital. The hardest moment was having to put a breathing tube in my patient who could no longer breathe for herself and after the breathing tube went in, we called her family and the husband, of course, couldn\u0027t visit her because of visitor restrictions at the hospital. So I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear, as he told her that he loved her so much and then I had to wipe away her tears as she was crying, said Trainor. I\u0027m used to seeing very sick patients and I\u0027m used to patients dying but nothing quite like this. In the flip of a switch, without the support, they\u0027re completely isolated. They\u0027re very sick. Some of them recover and some of them don\u0027t. But the hardest part, I would think, is them having to go through this feeling like they are alone.Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with Covid-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift, outside the hospital where she works in Maryland. Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it\u0027s hard to think of the family that they are missing, Mehring said.Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift outside the hospital. The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her, Hamil said.The tech giant says Meet uses encryption and does not process data for advertising, nor share it with any third parties.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Absolutely, yes.“No one wants to see people losing their jobs which is what would happen, but the reality is for the market at large, online has been getting bigger and bigger, with John Lewis at the vanguard.”He said 30 per cent of all retail was already online, adding that “for John Lewis that number was short of 50 per cent before Covid-19, although now it’s at 100 per cent”.Mr Hyman said: “The reality is, the retail world we are all moving into means every retailer needs fewer stores than it did before, including John Lewis, and not addressing this problem puts the rest of the business in jeopardy.”Shortly after arriving at John Lewis Partnership earlier this year, Dame Sharon\u0026nbspwarned the company was facing the most challenging period in its history.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a charity supplied by The Felix Project.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS.This will mean anyone who is working and living in a care home will be able to have access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

was also capacity for all over 65s and their households with symptoms, and for all workers who have to leave home to do their jobs.He said: From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to\u0026nbsptesting will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe.It\u0027s possible because we\u0027ve expanded capacity for\u0026nbsptesting thus far.Mr Hancock insisted care homes had been a top priority for the government as he announced plans to publish daily data on deaths in care facilities and the\u0026nbspcommunity, rather than just hospitals.Professor John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, said studies had shown that the\u0026nbsppresence of symptoms was not really a good marker in the care home setting for coronavirus among residents and staff.There were significant numbers who were asymptomatic who had the virus and so we have massively increased the amount of testing available, he said.Created with Sketch.Silence for key workers who lost lives to coronavirus Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Staff react outside Salford

During a train stop in China early last year, she was given the job of extinguishing her brother’s cigarette.Some analysts said\u0026nbspthat she has the only real characteristic that matters in the North Korean system – being of the “Paektu blood line”, a direct descendent of the Kim dynasty.But North Korea is also a rigid patriarchy, and her gender would most likely rule her out as anything more than a caretaker leader in the event of her brother’s demise.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like his brother, he also studied abroad in Switzerland.According to Kenji Fujimoto, the Japanese man who claims to have been the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, the late North Korean leader\u0026nbspdecided Kim Jong-chol was too “girlish” to lead the country. It would seem to be a long shot for him to return to the fold of public life.The private life of North Korea’s first family is notoriously shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he has been married to former singer and cheerleader Ri Sol-ju since 2009.South Korea’s intelligence services believe the couple have had three children – including a son born in 2010, a daughter born around 2013 and third child in 2017.Bizarrely, perhaps the best insight into the Kim family came from the 2013 visit of US basketball star Dennis Rodman, who described Kim Jong-un as a “good dad” to his then-young

to take over.Nonetheless, US officials believe that keeping control of the country within the family is still the most likely outcome. Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, Donald Trump’s national security adviser Robert O’Brien said of any succession: “The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family.”North Korea’s most senior officials have stayed in their jobs through unflinching loyalty to the Kim family, sometimes over multiple generations.In the event that new leadership is required, it is possible that several high-ranking Workers’ Party elders could team up to see the country through any transition.After decades of service including as Kim Jong-un’s first military chief, Choe Ryong-hae rose to be the North’s nominal head of state last year becoming the president of the Presidium of the Supreme People’s Assembly.He and Pak Pong-ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North’s push to introduce more elements of a free market to revive its economy, would be the likely figureheads of any collective leadership.In such a scenario, the former top nuclear envoy Kim Yong-chol and foreign minister Ri Son-gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues including stalled denuclearisation talks with South Korea and Washington, as they played key roles in previous summits with Trump.“Kim now puts his younger sister, Kim Yo-jong in charge of many things, and she is the only sibling and trusted confidante inside his cabinet. Ultimately, though, it is his son who would inherit the kingdom,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours. Less is more, guys.TV astrologer Russell Grant made this uncanny  prediction, for those of us born in the star sign Cancer, late last year, in the Mirror.“Travel is on the cards in the spring and as much as you enjoy your home le, you will appreciate this change of scene.”Yeah, the Sainsbury’s queue was a blast, thanks Russ.“It’s not just The Big Night In, April  is, of course . . .”A St George’s Day B Shakespeare’s birthday C Darren Huckerby’s birthday It was D “The start of Ramadan.”The clue being in the letters BBC, of course.THE Dave channel has been attempting to ease the nation’s ever-present mental health worries via the gt of laughter.A noble cause and a good idea.Unfortunately, they’ve given the all-important job to some of the worst comedians in Britain.Last week, it was the turn of Nish Kumar, Suzi Ruffell, Seann Walsh and Darren Harriott, whose attempts to end Britain’s silent suffering were ided into two separate and contrasting segments.In the first, backstage, they discussed their own experiences of mental health issues, which sounded more like a lot of really bad hangovers, egotism and self-pity, while making the usual heartfelt pleas for tolerance, understanding and a constructive dialogue.’Cos, you know, they’re alive to the fact they’re meant to care.Then Kumar and Ruffell went out on stage and spewed vile, angry foul-mouthed hatred about Boris, Trump, Top Gear, Richard Hammond , fellow comedians and anyone who’s got what Ruffell calls “lazy opinions”.That is to say, anyone who has the temerity to hold a dferent political opinion to her own.Not a single word of it was funny, let alone healing.Darren Harriott, the least worst of them, though, did at least have the decency to provide the necessary cue.“I struggle to give people all of me ’cos I’m always worried they’re going to go, they’re going to disappear and . . .”Click.He’s got a point, hasn’t he.Paul Merson: “Bournemouth seem to keep coming up without answers.”Micah Richards: “The way he carried his body language was outstanding.”Matt Le Tissier: “Spurs are never going to win the league in a million years.

He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

Another option is opening primary schools first and secondary schools later.A source said: “Ministers are determined to give every child the chance to get back into the classroom in some form before schools break up for summer.”Mr Williamson told MPs at the Education Select Committee: “When we bring schools back — and I think everyone wants to see schools ing — they will be ed in a phased manner.“We recognise that the idea of schools all ing on day one with the full complement of pupils is not practical.”He added schools will not open through the summer holidays to offer catch-up classes.Teachers are due holidays, with many having carried on working for vulnerable and key worker children, or preparing home-school lessons.Mr Williamson has ordered scientists to work out how to reopen schools safely and expects their answers soon. But there are growing fears poorer kids are being left behind in the lockdown. And education chiefs worry that will become worse the longer it goes on.Alarming figures released last week revealed only around one in every  pupils eligible to keep going to school in the lockdown are actually doing so.Deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told Downing Street press conference: “I am absolutely clear that it was the right thing to do to close schools when we did.“Equally we now have to be very careful indeed about how we reverse social distancing measures and when we do it.”School bosses will have to work out how to impose social distancing in classrooms while convincing worried parents it is safe for them to send their offspring back.Teachers have suggested that kids could alternate their schooling, spending one week in class and one week at home, to slash the number of pupils in school at any one time. But they have warned that it is unrealistic to expect small kids in school to stay two metres away from each other.Mr Williamson said the Government is looking closely at countries like Germany and Denmark, who have already announced theof their schools.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

But Italy, one of the countrys hardest hit by coronavirus, is not reopening schools until September.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he is pleased theof schools looks like being done in a “phased manner”.He added: “There are ious possibilities, including prioritising some year groups who are at crucial stages in their education, as well as disadvantaged children from other year groups, or using a rota system for all pupils, perhaps with one-week in school followed by one-week learning from home.”So it is good to hear Education Secretary Gavin Williamson planning a phased or part-timefor schools.That said, the prospect of older pupils having another two full months at home and then the summer off will fill many of them and their parents with dread.Weeks have now gone by under ­lockdown. While some schools have done an admirable job keeping pupils busy, setting work and insisting on it being finished, others have not.The gap between the best state and private schools and the rest grows ever wider. Deprived and vulnerable children drop further behind by the day.The overall pupil percentage receiving daily online tuition is worryingly small, according to the Sutton Trust educational charity. And while kids remain at home, their parents cannot go out to work eventhey are allowed to do so.That is hammering the economy.Meanwhile the toll on young people’s mental health is grim, cooped up with their families — and with their mates only available to them online,at all.We know the Government is nervous about any relaxation of restrictions, especially with Germany considering reimposing them. And Mr Williamson rightly insists he will be guided by the science. But the science is ambiguous.A study by University College, London, found school closures had only a small impact on the virus’s spread.­Norway has opened its primaries. Switzerland is doing the same, and letting under-tens hug their grand- parents because their scientists “know young children don’t transmit the virus”.Our Government is of course doing what it thinks best. But it must continue to challenge our experts on why their evidence conflicts with that where.The urgent need to rescue our economy holds equally for our children’s schooling.Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union, said she was “relieved” schools will not be opening in the summer holidays.She added: “When the scientic evidence allows for ato school, a great deal of preparation will be needed.“Issues such as how social distancing can be achieved and which year groups might be first during the phasedare extremely complex.”To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bigger events will be a challenge this summer.”On Monday, Arsenal were the first top-flight club toto their training ground, after  days of isolation.Amazingly, each squad member had a pitch to themselves, to follow social distancing guidelines.English football, encouraged by the Government, could stage matches at a limited number of venues from June , while Government adviser Eyal Winter says theatres and cinemas could reopen with gaps in seating and selling half as many tickets as before.Prices could rise to cover revenue shortfalls.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Yvonne Doyle said experts are trying to learn the answer after , deaths outside hospital since March were included in daily figures for the first time. The Medical Director of Public Health England told the Mirror that in some ways, testing would not help - as some elderly residents died so quickly, they were not able to get a test. But she also said the movement of staff - who were not routinely tested in care homes until a fortnight ago - was critical in how Covid- is spread. She added: I think there are possibly more fundamental and structural issues about how care homes are run in an epidemic that we are now looking to implement. Tests for Covid- in care homes were severely limited until April , when the government widened capacity. On that date, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced officials would start testing people who had been discharged into care homes from hospital. This suggested those patients had, in some cases, not been tested before then. And he ended the policy of testing only five people with symptoms in a care home to confirm an outbreak, rather than everyone to know exactly who had the virus. Care home staff with symptoms were only able to get tested routinely from April .  Before that date there had already been between , and , deaths recorded in care homes, official figures show. First Secretary of State Dominic Raab also accepted the ebb and flow of staff into a care home, as well as friends and family members, was a crucial factor. He was asked the same question by the Mirror at the governmentaposs daily press conference. He said: Thereaposs always learning in an unprecedented, unique crisis that weaposll want to feed back in so that we can refine and fine tune the measures weaposre taking. We take the actions and the steps that we take based on the best scientic evidence that weaposve got at the time. Prof Doyle said: What we have learned a lot about is how the virus in dferent populations.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said trying to put all pupils back in classrooms on the same day will not be practical. He did not say who wouldto school first. But he pointed to countries that have separated pupils by age groups, as well as a region-by-region approach. London is thought to have been a couple of weeks ahead in the peak of the virus. The Cabinet minister did not put a date on when schools will reopen - saying only it should be at the earliest opportunity once it is safe. But he told the Commons Education Committee: When we bring schools back, they’ll be ed in a phased manner. We recognise that the idea of schools all ing on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical. Mr Williamson is waiting for advice from a subcommittee of the governmentaposs scientic experts SAGE, which was set up around three weeks ago. The review is looking at the particular issues of how to open schools once the governmentaposs five tests on curbing the virus are met.Head teachersapos leaders have warned the earliest realistic date schools can reopen is June  - and even then, planning would need to begin very soon. Mr Williamson told MPs we want to make sure schools are given proper notice before they are asked to reopen. There would also be specic advice for places like special schools which could dfer to the rest of the system, he said. He added students should have the opportunity to sit exams - but that he and exam boards have been working on holding them in the autumn. Mr Williamson confirmed he is looking to see “what works” in other countries including Denmark and Germany - both of which are phasing aby age. Denmark has sent children under  back to school first, while Germany has focused on older students who are taking exams, with the approach ying from one region to the next.  Mr Williamson admitted he is “concerned” about the number of children classed as vulnerable - often those in care or with care plans - missing school in the pandemic. Those children can continue attending schools but just % were doing so. The number since rose to %. Mr Williamson said there would need to be a “very targeted approach” at the most disadvantaged communities. The Cabinet minister said he is working very closely with the Home Office amid fears children are being targeted by predators online during the crisis.

The new Labour leader had planned to spend his first months in charge travelling to seats the party lost across Britain to convince voters it now offered a credible alternative. But, while we are still in lockdown, he will tour the country virtually instead, taking questions at town hall-style meetings on Zoom. His first meeting will take place in key Red Wall seats in Bury and the Tees Valley, that Labour needs to winit is ever going to form a government, before heading to Scotland next week. Mr Starmer said the exercise would help Labour to hold Boris Johnson to account. He said: “For the last three-and-a-half weeks, we have been trying to hear from the front line what’s actually happening... to compare and contrast with what the Government has said is happening.” He has accused ministers of being too slow in taking all the major decisions on coronavirus. Mr Starmer said a public inquiry into the Government’s handling of the crisis was “inevitable”. “At the moment we’re not calling for it because we want to support the Government getting the infection rate below one, which is why we’ve been supportive of them on lockdown, social distancing and increasing the capacity of the NHS. “The first priority is to get that infection rate down and an inquiry, I think, is inevitable.” Mr Starmer claimed it was possible for Labour to win the next election.  He told the Mirror: “I know it’s dficult. I know it’s a mountain to climb. But four years is time enough for us to do what we need to do. “We have to show why the future can be dferent. After three months of coronavirus... we cannot go back to business as usual. In particular, we can’t keep standing on our doorstep clapping our key workers at pm on a Thursday and then suggest that once we’re through this crisis, things can go back to as they were. Many of those people were underpaid and undervalued for years and years. “There’s going to have to be some fundamental change.”  And he said the Labour party had to “unite and pull together” after years of factionalism and focus “day in, day out” on winning the next election. “Nobody underestimates the scale of the task we’ve got, but there is a genuine sense in the Labour movement that we want to rise to this task,” he said Mr Starmer claimed, under his leadership, Labour could stop the sht of working class voters away from the party becoming permanent.

And now Ms Sturgeonaposs comments further reinforce the feeling that there will no quickto normal for Brits hit by the lockdown. Schools will reopen in a phased way but no date has been set yet, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said on Wednesday. Businesses such as garden centres may be allowed to reopen soon while the government is reportedly stockpiling face masks to possibly help commuters. Ms Sturgeon this week advised Scots to wear masks in shops and on public transport - but stressed this was not a substitute for social distancing. The words of caution come as Britainaposs death toll from the virus soared to more than , after retrospective care home and community victims were added to the official toll. This makes the UK the second worst-hit country in Europe and third worst in the world.  SNP leader Sturgeon claimed the decision to ease measures will not be a flick of the switch moment and will have to be very slow, very gradual. She said: People talk about lting the lockdown, that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment - weaposre going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. Iaposm far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the th of May weaposll be in a position to lt any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that weaposre operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow. It comes after Sturgeon changed her government’s approach by backing wearing face masks in public in limited circumstances on Tuesday - something not yet endorsed by her Westminster counterparts.  She stressed the evidence guiding her was limited and not overwhelming and that face coverings are not a substitute for staying at home. But she insisted there are some benefits to be yieldedthe coverings are used in crowded shops or on public transport. However, Sturgeon urged people not to point the finger at people not doing it. The advice does not refer to medical style masks, but a covering such as a scarf.

A source told the newspaper that the Government was eager for children toto school by summertime. Mr Williamson told a select committee today the Government did not have a fixed date for reopening schools but ruled out the prospect of them opening over the summer holidays. He told MPs: I do expect schools to be opened in a phased manner. I also intend to be giving schools as much notice as possible. Schools, colleges and nurseries across the UK closed their doors to the majority of pupils, apart from the children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters, more than five weeks ago. But as a deadline for the UKaposs lockdown review looms on May , a source reportedly told the Sun: “Ministers are determined to give every child the chance to get back into the classroom in some form before schools break up for summer.” Addressing the Education Select Committee earlier today, Mr Williamson said: We recognise that the idea of schools all ing on day one with the full complement of pupils is not realistic or practical. Mr Williamson did not say which year groups couldfirst, but he said they were looking at best practice in other countries, such as Germany and Denmark, where schools had begun to reopen. The minister added that there was no plan to run schools through the summer. Britainaposs head teachersapos leaders have warned the earliest realistic date schools can reopen is June . But even opening by that date would mean planning would need to begin imminently, they said.Asked about whether families could expect children toto school by summertime as some reports claimed, a Department for Education spokesperson said tonight: “Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has not set a date for schools reopening. “They will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientic advice indicates it is the right time to reopen and we have met the five tests set out by Government to beat this virus“We are also working in close consultation with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges when the time is right, and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.” Mr Williamson today told MPs the government wanted to give schools aposproper noticeapos before they are asked to reopen. He added students should have the opportunity to sit exams - but that he and exam boards have been working on holding them in the autumn.  Mr Williamsonaposs comments come after the Welsh education minister said on Tuesday that schools would not be reopening to all students any time soon, but that there could be a phasedfor some pupils.  When asked whether the Government would update its guidance on Personal Protective Equipmentand social distancing in schools to ensure teachers were kept safe, Mr Williamson suggested they may review advice when a phasedof schools began. He said: It is incredibly important that we get the right balance in terms of actually making sure that we create an environment that is good to learn in but also that is a safe environment for people to both work in and learn in as well. Mr Williamson was also pressed by MPs on what the Government was doing to ensure the learning gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers did not widen amid lockdown school closures. Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the committee, warned of a potential wave of educational poverty, safeguarding worries for children and a digital ide from the Covid- lockdown. He asked whether the Government would support his idea of an army of volunteers - made up of retired teachers, graduates, and Ofsted inspectors - to help tutor and mentor disadvantaged children when the lockdown ended.  Mr Halfon also called on Mr Williamson to introduce a catch-up premium to provide tuition for these poorer pupils. Some  MPs and peers warned on Wednesday that the attainment gap would widen without additional funding.

An overhaul of how deaths from the disease are reported meant ­official figures soared after those in care homes and the community were added to those in hospitals. We are now second only to Italy, where , people have died, in Europe and third globally – with the US reporting , deaths.And as more people begin to flout the lockdown, medics warned that coronavirus is “as dangerous” as the ebola virus, which ravaged west Africa from  to . At the Downing Street briefing, First Secretary Dominic Raab said there were , deaths from March  to April  outside hospitals, on top of  extra hospital deaths in the  hours to pm on Tuesday.He said: “From today, we are moving to an improved daily reporting system so that deaths in all settings are included, wherever the inidual has tested positive for Covid-.” Explaining the change, Public Health England’s Professor Yvonne Doyle said it “will give us a fuller picture of deaths and inform the Governmentaposs approach.  Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Starmer said: “Six weeks ago the Chief Scientic Adviser indicated the Government hoped to keep deaths to below ,. But we’re way above that and only partway through this crisis, and possibly on track to have one of the worst rates in Europe. “On Monday, the Prime Minister said many were looking at our apparent success. Does the First Secretary agree with me that far from success, these figures are truly dreadful ”Standing in for Boris Johnson, who announced the birth of a son with fiancee Carrie Symonds, Mr Raab admitted there was “joint horror” at the toll across the political ide. Prof Doyle said deaths in care homes were the “greatest concern” and , sites – nearly a third of all those in England – have outbreaks. Scientists who tracked a third of UK hospital patients for Europe’s largest study of coronavirus cases found our death rate was broadly the same as in the west African ebola outbreak. Despite higher standards of healthcare from the NHS, the study of , Covid- patients at  hospitals showed between % and % died. Chief investigator Professor Calum Semple, of Liverpool University, said: “It’s a common misconception that Covid is just a bad dose of flu. Once you are sick enough to go to hospital, Covid is as dangerous as ebola.”  He also blasted those flouting the lockdown, saying: “Still we see isolated egregious examples of selfishness where people think it’s OK to meet in the park and share a four-pack of beer. The reason the Government is keen to keep people at home is this is an incredibly dangerous disease.” During the No press briefing, Prof Doyle had identied an “uptick” in vehicle use, which has hit its highest working-day level since March . It came as drivers in Havant, Hants, descended on the first Burger King to reopen – queueing down the street.

The World War two veteran, who has turned  today, has raised almost £million for those battling coronavirus on the frontline of the NHS. He had planned to walk  laps of his  metre garden, completing  every day, by the time he turned . But as the money keeps pouring in, Captain Tom has vowed to keep going. The father-of-two has also become the oldest person to score a UK number one with his rendition of Youaposll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices Of Care Choir. And Captain Tom was also surprised with a special Pride of Britain Award for his astonishing fundraising walk that inspired the nation. Carol revealed the Pride of Britain team had received thousands of nominations for Captain Tom to receive an award this year for this amazing efforts. So Pride of Britainaposs awards research  took the unprecedented decision to declare him a winner before the traditional Autumn announcements. Stars also lined up to pay tribute to his efforts in a special montage video, including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, actors Dame Julie Walters and Michael Sheen and sporting heroes Anthony Joshua, Harry Kane and Joe Root. Sir David Jason said: “In the s, you and your mates stepped up to the plate to help the country out and here you are again, you are a hero. And I salute you.” After seeing the video, Captain Tom said: “I’m absolutely over-awed by it. Famous people doing such great things themselves, I’m completely taken aback by all those famous people on the screen there. Thank you very much, so kind of you all.” Captain Tomaposs inspirational walk is not the first time he has come to his countryaposs rescue. Aged just  he was conscripted into the Army in  and in the middle of World War Two. He served with the th Battalion of the Duke of Wellingtonaposs Regiment and was stationed in India and Burma. He trained in Cornwall and was involved in defending the coast amid fears of a German invasion. His dedication and ability shone through and he was soon promoted to Corporal before being sent to an officer training unit. Shortly after he turned , Captain Tom was again promoted to Second Lieutenant before being sent to the Duke of Wellington headquarters. In October, , Captain Tomaposs regiment were posted to India before moving on to Burma. Captain Tom was among the heroic troops from more than  countries to take part in the huge assault, across land and water, on Arakan. This was a key part in recapturing the area before Armed Forces advanced on the capital of Burma, now Myanmar, Rancoon. Despite its importance in the war, and the thousands of lives lost, the assault is often referred to as the aposForgotten Warapos. Captain Tom is now determined those he fought alongside should have the recognition he deserves and is taking part in a special ITV programme recalling his experiences in World War Two - Captain Tomaposs War. He has since ed to the scene of the fighting with his two daughters. ITVaposs Controller of Current Affairs Tom Giles, said: Captain Tomaposs War will shed light on a campaign which comparatively goes unmentioned but in which our troops suffered unthinkable hardship and tens of thousands of British soldiers fought and died.

Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey demanded that BA withdraw its threat to axe more than one in four staff.There is shock and anger at the sudden timing of Tuesday’s announcement, coming on the same day as the funeral of a cabin crew boss who died from coronavirus.It comes as other BA crew could potentially be putting their health at risk by manning repatriation flights and those bringing in vital PPE equipment for front line workers. BA owner International Airlines Group blamed a coronavirus slump in air travel for the proposed redundancies, warning it could be “several years” for passenger numbers to recover. Yet unlike other airlines, BA has not even asked for a Government bail-out. An IAG spokeswoman refused to comment on why this was. Struggling rival Virgin Atlantic has asked for £million and easyJet has borrowed £million. There was also no word on why the redundancies are solely hitting BA staff, rather other IAG airlines, such as Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling. The redundancy plans have been drawn up while BA is receiving millions of pounds of taxpayers for furloughing thousands of staff.  Mr McCluskey said: “BA’s decision to ignore the principle and intent of the job retention scheme and instead throw , workers onto the scrap heap is both unlawful and immoral. “It is unlawful because they are denying these workers the meaningful consultation that the law and common decency says that they are owed. “It is immoral because BA has been taking taxpayers’ money in recent weeks, money supplied on the proviso that the company put the workers on furlough while the industry reshaped.” Regarding protective equipment for crew, BA said: “We follow all the guidance from the UK Government and global health authorities, including Public Health England and the World Health Organisation.

Britain-based GlaxoSmithKlineaposs CEO Emma Walmsley said even getting hundreds of millions of doses ready by the second half of next year would require swt progress to ensure safety. It comes as US pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer claimed it could have a vaccine ready by this autumn, having already started mass manufacturing. The firmaposs CEO Albert Bourla told The Wall Street Journal: This is a crisis right now, and a solution is desperately needed by all. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   But while GlaxoSmithKline has confirmed developing a Covid- vaccine is its primary aim thanks to recent soaring profits, Ms Walmsley stuck to the -month timeline. You will see a reasonable amount of consensus from many global authorities, when this was all emerging, an -month time line was an ambitious one to be going after but one that everyone is [targeting], she told reporters yesterday. The UK-headquartered pharmaceutical group has joined forces with a raft of partners around the world to develop a number of vaccines for the disease.  Its update showed pre-tax profits soared % to £. billion in the first three months of the year on revenues % higher, helped by global stockbuilding of its drugs and healthcare products. More than  global vaccine development projects are under way as economies across the globe are burdened by restrictions on movement to slow the spread of the disease. Germanyaposs vaccine body, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, said this week that seven of the global projects had started testing on humans. GSK and rival vaccine maker Sanofi this month teamed up for a coronavirus vaccine project, the latest in a string of alliances that have seen the British drug maker contributing its expertise on adjuvants.Adjuvants are efficacy boosters that allow for lower dosing of the immunising active ingredient in a vaccine. The world needs several vaccines and there are several dferent approaches, Walmsley continued. She said the group had taken action to deploy our science and technologies to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Our primary aim is to develop multiple adjuvanted Covid- vaccines, and we are working with companies and institutions across the world to do so. It is also looking at so-called therapeutic options for coronavirus treatment and is collaborating with Vir Biotechnology to work on new antiviral antibodies that could be used for Covid- or future coronavirus outbreaks. The firm is likewise looking at drugs in its stable that could be used as antivirals or to prevent or treat Covid- symptoms.

After queuing outside she went in to buy a paintbrush only to witness another customer cough on them, reports Hull Live.She says there were up to  people in one aisle and others were also coughing. She then left without buying anything. The woman, from Holderness, east Yorkshire, said: “The queue outside was fine and everyone was staying two metres apart.  “They seemed to be letting people into the store in an orderly fashion but once inside it became a free-for-all. “There were  people down one aisle. People were coughing on to products and others were coughing into their hands and then touching items. “I wanted to buy a paint brush but someone coughed on them so that was that. “I don’t understand what these people were doing outthey were displaying anything that might be a symptom. It only takes one person to affect a number of others. “I’m not a germophobe. I’m a nurse and deal with all sorts but it was ridiculous. “There were no staff policing the aisles and no social distancing inside until you got to the tills.”  BQ announced last week it was reopening some stores and then revealed more would be opening a few days later.  of BQaposs locations are now open, and the chain plans to open the remaining of its stores by early May should it be safe enough to do so. The woman accepts there were measures in place but does not feel BQ can effectively enforce them and feels the chain should not have reopened yet. She said: “There was just no social distancing once inside other than at the tills where there was protection for the staff. “I just walked out again without buying anything. There was no way I was risking my health any further. “BQ had measures in place but no one policing them in the aisles. I just don’t think the store should have reopened yet. “They should just do click and collect like Wickes. I had a mask and gloves on but I still didn’t feel comfortable.” But BQ insists the measures in place are working and customers are well protected. A BQ spokesperson said: Similar to shopping at a supermarket, we’ve introduced social distancing controls at re-opened stores.

Moving pictures show a carer dancing with a resident at Newfields in Sheffield where for three days amazing staff took it in turns to hold a dying man’s hand One of those offering round-the-clock comfort was Kayleigh Jupp, , who survived the virus but said it was like being “hit by a train”. These moving photos reveal a rare glimpse of day-to-day le inside the nursing home that has been hit by the pandemic. Newfields in Sheffield is one of three run by Palms Row Health Care, which have lost  residents after testing positive for Covid-.And  residents and  staff have tested positive across the three homes. But staff are recovering and ing to work, like Kayleigh, who told The Mirror: “I love the residents and I love my job to bits. “The fact that I can make sure they are happy makes me feel grateful. I want my parents and grandparents to be looked after like this. It’s a joyous feeling going home and knowing I have made someone’s day that much better.” And she made Jack Dodsley’s day special when she asked: “Do you fancy a bit of a dance ” “His face lit up and his smile was so big. He said he’d done everything bar salsa because his we loved dancing. She died last year,” she said. Kayleigh added Jack, , a retired thermal insulation engineer from Sheffield, survived the virus and yesterday he got to go home.  Great-grandad Jack said: “I used to be a really good dancer with my we Rita. We were very good at rock ‘n’ roll. She was beautul. She died two weeks short of our  years.”He said of his experience with coronavirus : “I wouldn’t have known. I just felt a bit off.“The staff have been superb, they do a really special job. I can’t praise them enough. We should show them more appreciation.” But he has strong words for the Government: “Our Government were very very slow in reacting. I think they’ve let the carers down.” Kayleigh, of Chesterfield, Derbys, who has worked at the home for five months, said: “It has been a scary, scary, time and the fact nobody can see their families is hard. You can only do it over a video call. I’ve seen ­residents upset because they can’t see their families. We try to be the family for them. It’s been tough losing ­residents. We remain ­professional but it is heartbreaking.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 37 gave birth ivf","story":"NewsMum, , gave birth to IVF baby in bereavement room after contracting coronavirusClaire Trusson fell pregnant after having IVF following two years of struggling to start a family with her husband Murray MitchellShareCommentsBySophie Donovan:,  APR NewsClaire Trusson, , with her newborn in hospital \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But just weeks before she was due, she started to experience aposcoldapos symptoms and went into isolation - until she started experiencing contractions. In hospital, medics had to put her in the most isolated room on the ward to keep her away from all others - which turned out to be the bereavement delivery room. Claire went home and a day later tested positive for the virus - just a week before she found herself back in the bereavement suite to safely give birth to baby Jake.  Performer Claire said giving birth six weeks early while suffering from the virus was stressful - and she even wore a mask while caring for him in the early days. Claire, from Carshalton in Sutton, said: “I found out this week that that’s the bereavement room - thataposs where they put families with their stillborn babies so they can have some time with them. “They have a memorial clock on the wall, and because I was timing my contractions when I was first in there, I spent a lot of time staring at that clock. “I found it quite comforting in a way - it’s so full of love.  “I did think at one point, ‘it’s a strange choice to have a memorial clock in a room where women are labouring.’ “But in the scheme of things, I am super lucky - I’m well, he’s well and really it’s amazing. “In a way, I am really grateful that I didn’t have another six weeks of anxiety of what giving birth would look like. After struggling to conceive for two years, the pair received IVF on the NHS and a single egg was implanted in August . On March , Claire began isolating after what she thought was just a bad cold developed into a persistent cough. However after experiencing contractions for  hours, Claire was admitted to St Helier Hospital, Carshalton.  She informed staff of her symptoms before entering the hospital, and was isolated with her husband in the bereavement suite - to keep them away from others. Claire was sent home after two days to wait for her Covid- results, with painkillers for the early labour pain. A day later the test came back positive - Claire and her husband Murray, a luxury travel agent, were told to isolate for  days. However a week later, on March , Claire’s contractions became more frequent, and she ed to the same hospital. By the time she made it back to the isolated bereavement suite, the midwe could see the baby’s head. Claire said: “I didn’t want to go back into hospital.  “I knew from when I had been there, I felt like a bit of a drain on them. “They’ve got babies rushing in and you’ve got the midwives stuck in with me having to peel off their PPE and wash their hands ten times. “Midwives need to be able to run in and out and help people when they need to help people.”  Claire and her husband are still concerned about passing the virus onto their three-week-old son, due to a lack of facemasks. On the way home from hospital, Jake met his grandmother Angela and uncle David through the car window.

The womanaposs involvement with the cult is a source of ongoing harm to the young girl - referred to as Lara to protect her identity, the Court of Appeal has said. The youngster, who was born in , is at the centre of a battle between her parents over her living arrangements and her alleged exposure to the teachings of Universal Medicine - which is understood to have been founded in Australia in . Her father argues Lara should not be exposed to the groupaposs ideas and should live with him, while her mother does not accept concerns about the organisation and wants a reduction in the time the girl spends with her father. Judge James Meston QC, at the Central Family Court, ruled in January that Universal Medicine is a cult with some potentially harmful and sinister elements. He also found evidence put forward by the father relating to the harmful and potentially harmful influence and effect of Universal Medicine to be compelling. Judge Meston noted that material collated by the father shows dferent food categories according to the group, such as fiery foods and evil foods, and concepts it teaches, including the hierarchy, soul impulse purpose and esoteric oy massage. Universal Medicine is led by Serge Benhayon, a former bankrupt tennis coach from New South Wales Australia who has no medical qualications.It sells Esoteric healing products, music, publications, workshops and courses. Judge Meston ruled that a shared-care order made in , which also barred the mother from taking her daughter to Universal Medicine meetings and from imposing its teaching on her, should stand. For it to do so however, the mother should give formal, clear and specic undertakings to the court that she would disassociate herself and her child from Universal Medicine and its specic practices. The father appealed the judgeaposs decision and took his case to the Court of Appeal. In a ruling published on Wednesday, three senior judges allowed the appeal, saying the girl must be distanced entirely from Universal Medicine. Lord Justice Peter Jackson, sitting with Lord Justice McCombe and Lady Justice King, said: Shared care can therefore only continuethe mother makes an immediate and definitive break from the organisation. Otherwise Lara should move to live with her father.

There is evidence of critical illness, but it is rare. The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a signicant role.

Graham had aimed to be the oldest to row solo across the Atlantic but missed out on the record because of the final six miles. He was fighting through the night against the winds which are a common foe for those rowing into Antigua. But he told his we Jean that no matter how hard he rowed he was not getting anywhere. Coastguards, who had been watching him, askedhe needed assistance and he said yes. Mrs Walters added: “I’m glad he has got common sense. He will still get a hero’s welcome.” The retired carpenter fought huge storms in his home-built boat and even a shark attack during his epic , nautical-mile crossing since leaving the Canary Islands on January  before the pandemic affected most countries. But he faces Covid- screening and a -day quarantine before he can come home. And because of his age, Graham will have to go into isolation when he comes back to the UK. The adventurer has kept in touch with Jean, , via weekly calls on his satellite phone, so he knew about the pandemic. At home in Thurmaston, Leicestershire, Jean said he was hoping for a big welcome: “But it won’t be like that. Everyone will have to be distanced.” Graham built his boat, The George Geary,  years ago in his front garden and named it after his grandad, a Leicestershire and England cricketer in the s and s. He rowed the Atlantic in , ,  and , but said this will be his last journey. During his -day crossing to support veterans charity Help The Heroes, his boat had a major leak and he injured his knee when a huge wave knocked him off his feet.

A well-placed source told The Dailythe Duke of Sussex, who stepped down as a senior royal last month, has revealed to pals he is really missing his time as a soldier and his military appointments. As part of the deal which saw the prince, , and we Meghan Markle aposabdicateapos to North America, the Queen stripped her grandson of his appointments. These include Captain General of Marines, Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Honington, and Commodore-in-Chief of Small Ships and Diving. The source continued: “He was in a happy place when he was serving in the Army, then he met Meghan and since then le has been great. But I don’t think he foresaw things turning out quite as they did.” However, they added Harry doesnapost blame Meghan, , with the couple and son Archie now living in Los Angeles, but has a sense he was potentially better protected in the forces. During his military career, the duke, known as Captain Wales by his comrades, spent  years in the Army during which time he undertook two operational tours of Afghanistan and qualied as an Apache helicopter commander.  While serving, he also went on to found the Invictus Games, a competition for injured, sick and wounded Armed Forces personnel and veterans. Harryaposs military career came to an end in June , but since that time he has remained a passionate advocate for the Armed Forces and has been bestowed a number of ceremonial military titles. Speaking of the titles, he once said: Luckily for me, I will continue to wear the unorm and mix with fellow servicemen and women for the rest of my le, helping where I can.  His highest profile military title is as Captain General of the Royal Marines, a role he was handed by the Queen in December , succeeding the Duke of Edinburgh. As the ceremonial head of the elite unit, Harry was entitled to wear the unorm and insignia equivalent to a Field Marshal.  At some stage Harry will be entitled to a small Army pension, as a retired officer after ten years, which will amount to around £, a-year, boosted by his qualication as an Apache helicopter pilot.  His promotion to Captain General came after he served alongside  Commando in Helmand Province and was later invited by the green berets to open a new base at Plymouth. Since taking up the post Harry has visited the Commando Training base, joined them in action during war-games in Norway and spent a day with SBS special forces in their killing house at Poole, in Dorset.

Weather maps show a warm front creeping into southern areas of England, around Cornwall, on Saturday, with Sundayaposs temperatures rising even further.The C highs, weaker winds and brighter sunshine will make for a pleasant weekend as Brits remain on coronavirus lockdown.Forecasts suggest it is unlikely the UK will see the baking heat of earlier this month anytime soon, however. Britain was yesterday expected to be lashed by a week’s worth of rain in just  hours with eight flood alerts in place across the country. The Midlands saw the brunt of the torrential rain, while added to that some Brits were also subjected to thunder and hail. Until the last couple of days, this April had been the driest since , when the month saw an average of .mm of rainfall. But with the likes of even Russia set to hit baking temperatures by the end of the weekend, there is hope for washed out Brits. BBC forecaster Phil Avery said: Over the weekend, into the start of next, I think weaposll see a plume of heat gradually working its way up through Iberia, may even touch  degrees in some locations.  And even begins to warm up in Moscow. In the meantime, Thursday looks like another miserable time weather-wise for the UK.The Met Office forecasts showers for much of the country, heavy at times, with hail and the odd rumble of thunder in parts of Scotland.Further showers are then expected this evening with some frost in parts of northern England and Scotland.  Though only seven flood alerts have been put in place by the Environment Agency. Chief meteorologist at the Met Office, Andy Page, said: After several weeks of high pressure bringing plenty of dry, warm and sunny weather across the UK, this week weaposre seeing thelow pressure, allowing Atlantic weather systems to once again move across the UK, bringing unsettled, cooler weather. On Thursday and Friday weaposll see sunny spells and showers for most parts of the UK, with temperatures around average for the time of year.

On April , Jenneraposs water broke. Andre found out he tested positive for the virus just as the couple were on the way to the hospital.  This meant that Jenner was forced to drive  miles to the hospital alone, giving birth to her boys the next day without her husband by her side as he self-isolated. Mitchell was born  pounds,  ounces, and Mackin weighed  pounds,  ounces. After giving birth, Jenner found out she also tested positive for the virus.

The list was revealed in all its glory on Mumsnet after the site posed the question What would you never name a child and why . And the mums did not hold back...     . Mia   – Because it means missing in action. . Lana   – As spelt backwards, it looks rather rude. . Fanny   – For obvious reasons. . Grace   – Because there are very few accents that say it gracefully. . Amelia   – As one mum find the aposmeapos so whiney. . Graham   – As it sounds like Grey Hamapos. . Flora   – One mum admitted:makes me think of bacteria. . Alexa   – Because it sounds too much like the virtual assistant. . Mercedes   – A parent said: She’s a child not a car. . Luna   – Because itaposs a pet name.

The seaside compound in Wonsan, on the countryaposs east coast, is dotted with guest villas and serviced by a private beach, basketball court, and private train station, according to experts and satellite imagery. An airstrip was bulldozed last year to build a horse riding track, while a boathouse nearby shelters Kimaposs Princess  luxury yacht, valued at around  million in . Officials in South Korea and the United States say it is plausible Mr Jong-un may be staying there, possibly to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus, and have expressed scepticism of media reports he had some kind of serious illness.However, they added that the leaderaposs health and location are closely guarded secrets and reliable information is dficult to obtain in North Korea.

In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund.

Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted.

After six years at the club, ‘Gowser’ is still going strong in dark blue.Fans favourite, Hemmings, ran McGowan very close with a strong run of form since the middle of December, breaking the -goal barrier in the final match against Ayr. Impressive showings in wins over Dunfermline and Partick in December stand out but his top display came back in October at a chilly Alloa, where the only disappointment was when he fluffed a chance to seal a hat-trick late on.The -year-old was a real star for manager James McPake after he gave him a regular run in the first team at the beginning of the campaign. Such a steady and unflustered player in the middle of the park, Robertson allowed the more experienced players to shine alongside him. That’s not stopped the teenager picking up regular good grades, in particular a fine showing against Dundee United at Tannadice in December.The first signing of the season, former Partick and Ayr winger, McDaid, showed dferent sides to his game last term. When the team struggled to create goalscoring opportunities early on, McDaid was still a regular threat and he’s shown his defensive capabilities more recently as a wing-back. His tackling in the area in derbies may need some work but McDaid will be determined that the best is yet to come from him in dark blue.Undoubtedly a class act in the middle of the park, Scotland international Dorrans showed glimpses of his best form throughout the campaign as he worked himself back to full fitness following y injury issues. The ex-Rangers man grabbed a vital goal at Tannadice in the - derby draw in December and was a driving force throughout.It seems defenders didn’t fare too well in   but make up almost the rest of the top .Honourable mentions go to Jordan McGhee ., Jordon Forster ., Jack Hamilton ., Shaun Byrne . and Jordan Marshall .."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Larder-006.jpg ","title":"new community larder to be opened in st marys to meet high demand","story":"The team behind Kirkton Community Larder has warned Dundee to expect #a lot of trauma# even after the Covid- crisis ends.Due to a rise in demand # especially from families, students and the self-employed # the team has been forced to open a new foodbank in St Mary#s.And talks with the Red Cross have already begun to help the team plan for the longer term.Eddie Baines, who works at the Kirkton Larder, explained: #Demand across all of Strathmartine has been mad.

years earlier, Kirkland stopped a similar disaster when he spotted flames inside the stadium’s boardroom in the early hours.His quick response ensured the damage was not as severe as , although there was little thanks from one Dons board member.Now  and based near Glasgow, Kirkland said: “I was coming home late one Saturday night with my girlfriend after we had been at a dance.“We were walking past the golf clubs on Golf Road at around .am when I noticed a light in the Main Stand.“At first I thought it was light from a lamppost, but when I got closer it was moving around.“When I walked up to the stand I saw it was a fire inside the boardroom, so I ran to the bottom of the street where there was a phone box and called the fire brigade.“If I hadn’t been there I don’t know what would have happened because all the stands were wooden at that time.“When you look back to the fire at Bradford, it could maybe have turned out something like that due to all the wood.“Thankfully there wasn’t that much damage and it was all confined to the boardroom.“One of the directors talked to the press and thanked me, but after that took me aside privately and told me off for being out late at night.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold.

I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish.

Season to taste. Add two-thirds of dressing. Arrange on a plate. Partially tear the burrata and place on top. Scatter over pistachios and remainder of dressing. Serve.Salt Baked FishThis is a simple, stress free way to cook fish which is a showstopper. The crust acts like an oven, sealing in the moisture, allowing the fish to cook in its on juices.

There are no exact quantities. You are looking for a coarse wet sand texture. Imagine you are on the sea shore making sand castles!Stuff the cavity of the fish. Overlap lemon slices and pack with herbs. Experiment with herbs, its just important to fill it with something to maintain its shape and perfume the fish flesh.Use one third of the mixture for the base. Pat out into an even half inch layer. Place the fish on the bed of salt. Cover it with the remaining salt. Pat gently down until it covers the fish, like an envelope. Make sure there are no cracks.Bake for approx mins. If you have a thermometer insert it into the thickest part, it should be C, or a kne inserted into the thickest part should come away easily. Another way to test is is to remove the first spine closest to the head. If it comes out with ease then itrsquos ready. Let the fish rest for  mins. Cut round the circumference of the salt casing. You should be able to lt it off. Discard. Brush away any excess salt.To serve run your kne down the spine of the fish between the two fillets and gently lt off.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained. So handmade soap is much kinder but will still destroy viruses.She uses coconut oil, shea butter, essential oils and Himalayan salt to make her organic soap, but strongly advises against attempting to break out the saucepans to rustle up your own bar.ldquoIf yoursquore not careful, homemade soap can go a bit rubbish ndash therersquos chemistry involved, caustic soda.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The lockdown exit plan is ageist  Over-70s can decide what   s best for their health","story":"They are a mixture of the married, orced and widowed.

They live in dferent parts of the country, come from dferent socio-economic backgrounds, have dferent desires and goals.So why are they being treated as one homogenous, vulnerable group, and condemned to an indefinite lockdown While it looks like those of us aged  and under may soon be allowed to restart our lives as part of the lockdown exit plan ndash albeit cautiously and while following social distancing measures ndash it seems the over-s may be told by the Scottish and UK governments to keep self-isolating for up to  months. Maybe longer.Such a blanket policy surely has ageism at its core, regardless of how well-intentioned.

We also know, of course, this cruel illness can afflict, sometimes kill, young and fit people.Until a vaccine is widely available ndash an endeavour scientists believe may take  months or more ndash many people with underlying health conditions of every age group will obviously want to take maximum care and precautions to prevent exposing themselves to danger. They accept, hard as it may be, that they wonrsquot be able to leave home. Others wonrsquot have the mental capacity to make these decisions for themselves.But what about over-s that are fitter, healthier and more active than their younger relatives and friends  And what about older people who do suffer from underlying health problems but would rather take a dferent approach once restrictions start to be lted They may decide it is worth leaving home, spending time with grandchildren and friends, going shopping, evenit means an increased chance of catching the virus. They may be willing to accept the associated risks and consequences.Whatrsquos so galling is the idea that no-one over  can or should decide for themselves what risks they are willing to take with their own health and wellbeing.One of most interesting aspects of this crisis has been the way it has forced all of us to examine and question what makes le worth living. Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules.

With supermarkets now representing one of the primary spread points for Covid-, the sale of alcohol poses a signicant problem, as additional approval from staff is required.Staff members are subjected to close contact with the customer, and for shoppers using the self-checkout, both parties are required to interact with the touchscreen, negating the important social distancing and contactless shopping measures.Will Broome, chief executive of white-label retail app Ubamarket, is one of many industry commentators that believes that retail technology holds the answer to truly contactless shopping.Ubamarket says it is one of a number of firms that are pioneering a way to allow customers to make in-app payments and very age through the touch of a mobile screen through formal Home Office pilots.It makes use of Yoti anonymous age estimation technology which has previously helped the BBC investigate a social media trend where people make money by selling their nude photos and videos.A Ubamarket spokemsan said that self-checkouts for retailers presents a \"serious concern\" for them and the protection of their teams and customers.\"However, with retail technology, where a customer only needs to touch their own mobile phone by incorporating in-app payments and age verication, the whole process can be safer for everyone without risking any illegal sales,\" said a spokesman."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  Becoming a community volunteer has taught me so much","story":"In Italy, in case of breakdown, all drivers are required by law to have one of these high-vis vests, not just for themselves but also for passengers.

The spirit of kindness this pandemic has stirred is humbling. Wersquove always liked to think of ourselves as a caring nation ndash not always with reason ndash but seeing the range of ways in which theory is being put into practice is eye-opening. This will have far-reaching consequences, some of which, I suspect, will reverberate long after lockdown. Not the least of these is discovering how many are eager to be pressed into service, and what they can achieve when marshalled.None of us knows how long more vulnerable members of society will be asked to stay home. What is increasingly clear, though, is that while the sort of helpful domestic support going on now will be finite ndash even , for some, the necessity of relying on others makes it feel never-ending ndash informal community involvement on several fronts will continue to be important, and perhaps even essential, in the coming years.Long before the present situation, a crack squad of citizen gardeners had taken it upon themselves to turn our nearest town into an outpost of Kew gardens. Others put up Christmas decorations, or tend the tubs and raised beds at the train station, keeping plants on the concourse thriving across the seasons. There are iniduals, meanwhile, who go out in all weathers with litter pickers and refuse bags. They clear the verges and river banks of crisp-packets, plastic bottles, cans, takeaway cartons and all the detritus ditched by those who shouldknow better. Thanks to them, wildle and livestock are safer, burns cleaner, the undergrowth no longer unsightly and depressing.Irsquove always been intrigued by those who donrsquot feel their patch ends where their property meets the pavement. For such folk, the mental map of where their obligation or responsibility lies stretches far beyond the obvious bounds of self-interest. Most of us like to keep our own house in order, but those who are outward-looking are protective of a much wider area. The same goes for helping others. For some, the family circle is as far as their antennae reach. Others respond to those in need whom theyrsquove never met, or ndash through charitable giving especially ndash whose names theyrsquoll never know.Who can say what state the economy will be in when this virus goes into retreat, nor how long it will take to recover. None of the predictions makes cheerful reading, so it seems reasonable to assume that, for a period at least, there will not be an abundance of cash in council coffers. They were hardly overflowing a year ago but with the likelihood of a serious fiscal downturn, shoestring budgets will grow even more threadbare.Around these parts, people are stepping up, not just to collect refuse or plant bulbs by the roadside, but to mow communal areas of grass, strim embankments and de-litter waterways and bridlepaths. You could say that most of this is the councilrsquos responsibility, and yoursquod be right. At a certain point, however, it becomes a pernicious and self-defeating outlook always to expect others to get things done when you could simply get up and do it yourself.So, while this is not intended to suggest letting local government off the hook, whenever essential services come under threat ndash rural buses and post offices, libraries, care packages ndash those of us with time, imagination and inclination can surely help plug the gap, evenonly in the short-term.Thanks to the current volunteer force, I foresee a future when, with the memory of Covid  fading, initiatives intended to get us through this emergency will live on and help communities flourish.

He discovered that paper towels, among other things, had been counted as part of the billions of items of Personal Protective Equipmentthe Government said it had delivered. A pair of gloves was marked down as two items.The stockpile that the Government held did not include the gowns, masks and eye protection stipulated as essential by world health bodies. When shortages emerged, offers of help from British firms were ignored. Staff in some hospitals resorted to wearing DIY kits of bin bag aprons and swimming goggles.: Coronavirus in ScotlandFinally, when it became obvious that the Government was breaking its own rules on protecting staff it changed the guidelines. Covid- was taken off the list of ldquohighly consequential infectious diseases for which full kit was required.It was a classic case of fail to prepare, prepare to fail. So yes, governments across the UK have failed the NHS. For it is not just in England that there have been warnings about lack of PPE. Complaints have arisen across the UK, including Scotland.Some of the NHS staff who appeared on Panorama were justiably angry. They know how much the public appreciates what they are doing. They have been enormously touched by the weekly clap for carers.

The issue is how well or otherwise they were prepared, and how quickly and competently they move to fix the problems. As one doctor told Panorama, this crisis is unprecedented, that word Ministers and others keep using ad tedium, but it was not unexpected.The very least NHS and care staff are owed is an apology. A proper admission from governments that they should have done better.This is crucial as the country moves towards the eventual lting of the lockdown. People must have trust in their governments.

My own personal view is that we do it as one United Kingdom.However, he then went on to say: \"But there is a specic scientic justication for saying island communities can be areas where you could pilot some measures, contact tracing in particular, in order to combine that with relaxing measures at a progressively greater rate and that can help you judge what is right for the country overall.He added: \"My belief overall is its betterwe do it as one United Kingdom but there are specic opportunities in island communities to conduct trials.\"Mr Mundell also asked about the dferent approaches north and south of the border on face masks and coverings after Nicola Sturgeon advised people in Scotland this week to consider wearing them in confined public spaces.\"Within the devolution settlement there is scope for ergence, so where do you think the balance lies between ergence and the need for a unorm message  he asked Mr Gove\"Im slightly confused at the moment because here in Scotland Im being recommended to cover my faceIm in certain shops and on public transport, yetI travel to London I dont have to do that, so where does the balance lie between having one message and the ability to devolve  added the Dumfriesshire MP.Mr Gove replied: \"On ergence, obviously it is the case because we respect the devolution settlement that dferent policy approaches can be floated or proposed by the devolved administrations, but it is betterwe work as one.\"The point that you make about masks is one example wheretheres a consistent message across all parts of the UK it makes it easier for people to understand, appreciate and comply,\" he added.Earlier, during PMQs, Dominic Raab also touched on the Scottish Governmentrsquos framework strategy but insisted Edinburgh had ldquonot set out an exit strategy, adding: ldquoI read through very carefully their -page document, it was eminently sensible and it was grounded in the five tests that I set out on April .\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-covid-vaccine-might-prove-impossible---especially-social-distancing-works","story":"Until then,working from home, bans on mass gatherings, and restrictions on whether pubs, restaurants and even hairdressers can re-open will be the ldquonew normal.The pessimistic outlook ndash at least for the short to medium term ndash was laid bare by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week as she warned that restrictions may remain in place ldquofor the rest of this year and maybe even beyond.But whatan effective vaccine is never found ndash or not found in time : Sturgeon under pressure over delayed elective ops as Covid hospital admissions fallVaccines came too late for SARS or Ebola.

But vast surveillance testing, including thermal checks at airports, prompt isolation of patients, and strict quarantine for all known contacts, succeeded in interrupting human-to-human transmission to such an extent that the disease was effectively eradicated. There have been no known cases since.This may not work for Covid-, however. SARS patients were most infectious when they were already visibly ill with respiratory symptoms. There was no known transmission of the disease from asymptomatic or mildly sick patients.Covid-, on the other hand, seems to sp easily and transmits even before symptoms emerge. By the time patients become seriously ill, isolation will often come too late.Other hopes rest with antivirals, which have transformed HIV treatment.However, that too is proving elusive with the Lancet reporting today that the first randomised control trial of Ebola drug remdesivir found that it did not speed recovery in critically ill Covid patients, or reduce deaths, compared to a placebo.However, the scientists also note that their study ndash based on  patients in Wuhan, China ndash had to stop early after the steep decline in cases in China meant they ran out of patients to recruit.Ironically, the success of social distancing itself may hamper our quest for a cure."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-university-set-up-not-meeting-countrys-needs","story":"The switch from technical colleges to universities has indeed been a big mistake when one considers that around only five per cent of students went on to universities in the s compared to nearer  per cent today ndash Tony Blair and Alex Salmond have a lot to answer for.Small wonder, then, that our manufacturing has slumped to around  per cent of GDP and one of the main reasons why we were not been able to quickly ldquoscale up the testing for coronavirus and production of PPE ndash unlike Germany .In facing up to the unsustainable situationsome of the Scottish universities should perhaps switch back to polytechnic technical institutes suitable for a st century Britain in preparation for the inevitable on-shoring back of manufacturing jobs post coronavirus.

Only last week the UK Government delivered a further pound million for Scottish local government. This is money that should be urgently handed over to our struggling councils.These lelines come in addition to the billions of pounds being given by the UK Government to Scottish workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs or incomes as a result of the Covid- economic shakedown. Other support includes the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, the deferment of VAT and income tax payments, and a statutory sick pay relief package.Additionally, the British Army has been drafted in to assist with the response and relief effort.This unprecedented intervention was only achievable because it rests on the strong shoulders of the Union. The reality is that an independent Scotland would have buckled and collapsed had it faced the Covid- crisis alone. With tough times ahead, it would therefore be catastrophic economically for Scotland to go it alone by cutting itself adrt from the UK, which is the sixth-largest economy in the world.Even before the current Covid- crisis, the -page Growth Commission, led by economist and former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, predicted, in , that independence would cause years of austerity for Scotland.While therefore the SNP remain entitled to make an emotional case for independence, even its most diehard supporters must now concede that they have lost the economic argument.The Covid- crisis reinforces the point that independence remains an SNP pipedream which Scotland simply cannot afford.Tim Jackson, Gullane.HOW very sad that we are in a position where the UK cannot speak as one during the coronavirus crisis and factions have opened up ndash all leading to confusion and exacerbating our already-fractured society.We should have one source of advice from the Sovereign Government and forget about petty political point-scoring.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.HOW sad to see the pandemic stats from other countries similar to our own and realise that their death toll is a fraction of what we have here.If only we had been a bit braver at the referendum, how many lives could have been saved.Robert Drummond, Glasgow G.IT is disappointing that a politician of the stature of former Labour MP for Maryhill, Maria Fyfe, should seize upon the distortion by some sections of the press, who took out of context Nicola Sturgeons reply to a question about whether she would consider closing the border between Scotland and England Ms Sturgeon replied \"I dont have the power to close borders, but these are discussions of course we want to continue to have with the UK government\", referring to the UKs international borders .It is understandable that Ms Fyfe and Labour in Scotland should feel sore at the SNP Ms Fyfes former seat is now represented by an SNP MP, as indeed is every constituency in Glasgow, and Labour holds but one seat in Scotland however it only has itself to blame for the mortying mess in which it finds itself.

Universities donrsquot just deliver teaching and research. They are major drivers of the economy ndash with the University of Glasgow alone contributing over pound.bn in economic output.Universities are far from being immune to the financial impacts of the crisis. Indeed, there is every chance, as the Office for Budget Responsibilityrsquos figures show, that Higher Education could be one of the sectors which suffers most. Analysis by Universities UK suggests that the sector should be braced for revenue losses of several billion pounds, and that there is a signicant risk that some institutions across the UK will not survive at all.It is clear then thatwe are to see our universities play the role we know they are capable of in the national economic recovery, there will need to be an increase in public investment. It is deeply heartening that the First Minister has confirmed that all additional money delivered by the UK Treasury through the Barnett formula - stemming from extra investment in the sector south of the border - would be earmarked for higher education. Indeed, there is widespread recognition from the UK Government of the need for signicant support for the sector.The quest for the lsquonew normalrsquo must extend to universities too. For universities as with every other sector, there is no longer a status quo ndash and any calls for additional public funding need to make a virtue of this fact. We require new investment not to maintain old standards but to react and reform in the face of global change.We need to demonstrate a willingness to change in order to ensure we are best able to make a success of the new situation we are going to find ourselves in, and align ourselves even more closely with societal need. But we also need to be clear that the new success we seek isnrsquot just for our own sector ndash it is for Scotland, and our universities are only part of that.This of course wonrsquot entail doing everything dferently. In many cases, it will simply mean building on existing success. For example, our progress on Widening Participation in recent years has been extraordinary , with .% of Scottish domiciled entrants now coming from SIMD backgrounds ndash but it must go further, ensuring every young person in Scotland is ensured of the opportunity of a university education regardless of their economic background.But we should also help society confront new challenges. Universities UK have called for an additional investment in research. This could be tied to research themes our post-Covid society needs. A Covid economic downturn which risks rivalling the Great Depression will also scar the labour market, as previous deep recessions such as the early s have done. As our young people enter what is going to be a precarious labour market, Universities could do more in partnership with government. Part of the investment to support the sector could extend to funding postgraduate education for home students who would otherwise face a dficult labour market. If anything, our role in providing opportunity and equipping our young people with the skills they need to succeed is only going to be more important in a fragile economy and increasingly uncertain labour market. Such investment would help reduce inequality from the Covid economic shock. But it is also important for the national effort to come that graduates are equipped with the higher levelskills they need to succeed ndash and in the key sectors which can deliver maximum benefit to Scotland.Anything that would stand in the way of allowing universities to provide this social good ndash such as a reduction in funding ndash should be resisted. Equally, anything that would raise new barriers to young people in Scotland taking advantage of their right to higher education ndash such as a reimposition of tuition fees ndash should be dismissed with equal vigour. The arguments of austerity will not workwe want to see a genuine recovery that works for all.The economic contribution made by our sector is already huge ndash higher education is genuinely one of Scotlandrsquos success stories. It is also one of Scotlandrsquos top export sectors. It willto being that force in international education provision after the post-Covid crisis, especiallywe can preserve our relative strength and reputation internationally - with four of our institutions in the top  in the world.But we can and should do more. Last year I published a report for the Scottish Government on how universities can best harness and maximise their economic impact for the good of all and the current crisis offers an opportunity to re-examine some of the assumptions about how our sector operates. Our towns and cities are brimming with potential ndash and our universities can be the catalyst to turn this potential into tangible economic results. From the Quantum Technologies and Precision Medicine agenda in Glasgow to Big Data and Robotics in Edinburgh, and Le Sciences across Scotland, there are so many high potential areas for Scotland in which our universities are leading the way.I firmly believe thatwe take the right decisions, Scotlandrsquos universities can and will play a central role in our economic recovery. This will require investment and compromise on the part of both government and the higher education sector: but with both parties working together in the national interest, there is no reason why our universities in Scotland cannot continue to thrive, and to enhance our social, economic and cultural contribution to our national le.Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli is Principal of the University of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"silver-linings-peacetime-heroes","story":"The Daily MailSarah Vine wrote about the death of the mother of a lsquovery dear friendrsquo on Sunday.It was not just the fact hat she died that shocked everyone, she said. but that she died alone without her loved ones by her side.ldquoShe never got the chance to squeeze her husbandrsquos hand one last time, or hug her teenage grandchildren, or tell her sons she loved them.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Folk can do this by picking a m stretch of road or path, or by walking through a local greenspace and counting the number of instances of dog fouling in that area.

The data is to be used to increase awareness and drive action to tackle what the charity has described as one of Scotland’s worst environmental complaints.Paul Wallace, campaigns manager with Keep Scotland Beautul said: “It is extremely disappointing that the thoughtless actions of irresponsible dog owners means that our shared enjoyment of our local open and green spaces, and a brief escape from the stresses and strains of the current situation, can be ruined.“That is why Keep Scotland Beautul is calling on iniduals and families to take part in #TurdTag, helping to gather evidence from communities across Scotland to get an accurate picture of the scale of this problem – it is simple and easy to take part as part of the daily exercise allowed in guidance from the Scottish Government.” Results should be submitted to cleanup@keepscotlandbeautul.org by May , and shared using social media and the hashtag #turdtag copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time.

However, this is a constantly-changing situation and there may be a need to reapply restrictions after they are lted.#It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.“The virus is progressing at dferent rates around dferent parts of the country. We have thankfully not had any fatalities in the Western Isles and it has been some time since new cases of infection have been reported.“I am really grateful that so many islanders have been earnestly sticking to the social distancing guidance: this has undoubtedly kept infection rates down and helped ease the burden on the NHS. “I know that the talk of lting lockdown has a lot of people concerned about the prospect of an influx of people from areas of the country heavily affected by Coronavirus.#I certainly don’t want to see this, and I think we should all be prepared for the travel restrictions to the islands to be in place for the foreseeable future – eventhat means restrictions staying in place after lockdown across the rest of the country has been lted.”Last week Dr Allan – responding to a proposal for the islands to become ‘testbeds’ for easing lockdown – said there was a case to be made for a regional approach.However, he warned of obvious dangersthe islands became “subject to an influx of travellers from other areas where the virus has peaked.”Meanwhile, Highlands and Islands Tory MSP Donald Cameron urged local people “not to relax” their vigilance and to maintain social distancing.He said: “We must remember that vulnerable members of our community are relying on us to maintain strict discipline.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

So many businesses have suffered immeasurably since the Covid- crisis began, but The Range, a cornerstone of east Belfast#s Connswater shopping centre, isn#t one of them.Despite the so-called lockdown, and in spite of the Government#s persistent calls for people to stay at home unless they need to buy essential items, there is always an all-day-long line of eager customers waiting to gain entry to a store that stocks a vast array of home and garden goods, pet products and, for good measure, also houses an Iceland frozen foods concession.Indeed, arriving at a retail premises that doesn#t have a queue in these troubled times is akin to finding the Holy Grail.When I got to The Range at .am on Wednesday, there were  people ahead of me, with countless others having already been admitted. Despite tape markers on the tarmac every two metres en route to the large store#s entrance exit door, two men in front of me were clearly not observing social distancing rules and had positioned themselves virtually beside the guy directly ahead of them. Only one woman in the queue was wearing a face mask.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseA BM storeKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA BM storeSeveral signs inform the waiting patrons that there#s an NHS fast track system in place which allows health workers immediate access to the front of the queue.This was exemplied shortly before the runaway trolley episode when a woman darted across the car park, flashed a pass in my direction, muttered the words, I#m sorry, I hate doing this and gave me a Princess Diana sideways grin before walking directly in after speaking briefly to the employee guarding the door.You could hardly describe the early morning queue at The Range as fast-moving. The doormen use walkie-talkies to let colleagues know when to usher in the next batch of allegedly essential-item shoppersIt then emergedthat, although the lady in question was a key worker of an unspecied profession, she wasn#t in fact NHS and should, therefore, have taken her place in the queue with the rest of us. Instead, her illegal entry extended my waiting time, already running to half an hour, by another five minutes.You could hardly describe the early morning queue at The Range as fast-moving.

Another man had helped himself to a barbecue, a large bag of wallpaper rolls and several tins of paint.Outside, there were signs aimed at managing the unrealistic expectations of some of those in line: We#re sold out of all hot tubs, sorry.Two girls behind me got far too close for comfort, so it was ironic that one was wearing a pair of blue protective gloves.At one point the other brushed against my arm as she came up beside me to put some rubbish in a bin. After I finally got in and wiped down my basket - many shops are providing spray and kitchen roll type paper at their entry points - a woman#s voice boomed over the Tannoy, informing customers they should only buy essential items and warning them that anyone who spends more than  minutes in the store would be asked to leave.There were two problems with that. Firstly,you don#t cordon off the aisles, people are going to browse.Secondly,you#ve spent a long time queuing to get in, you#re going to make the most of it.Over at nearby BM at .am, there were  folk in front of me. It was windy and cold by then and quite unpleasant, which explains why a line which usually snakes at least m around the car park was more reminiscent of a wriggly worm.Near the entrance, where one man exited with four deck chairs, a sign informed us that the popular retailer, echoing The Range, currently has #no hot tubs or trampolines#That queue was moving swtly, but social distancing was clearly a very distant cousin to some. The man in front of me was less than half a metre away from the guy ahead of him, while the man behind me was far, far too close. Only one person was wearing a mask and gloves.Near the entrance, where one man exited with four deck chairs, a sign informed us that the popular retailer, echoing The Range, currently has no hot tubs or trampolines.I was only in the market for cat food.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelfast ’s Claire McNeillyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBelfast ’s Claire McNeillyLast stop, BQ at Holywood Exchange, which only reopened earlier this week. There I faced the worst queue of the morning, with more than  people ahead of me.Again, only one woman, who happened to be directly behind me, was wearing a face mask. Customer notices reminded people of social distancing, but at BQ the tape markers on the ground were used to good effect.An employee manning the door told one customer who danced out of the store with a portable spa that she was lucky to get one because they#re going like hot cakes.There was disappointment, however, for another customer who tried to bring back some paint only to be told that they aren#t taking s until this crisis is over.For someone who used to enjoy shopping, yesterday#s experience was both stressful and bizarre, not to mention a revelation as to what some people regard as #essential#.But three hours and three shops later, one thing was certain: we may not yet know how long the lockdown will last, but we can be fairly sure the toilet roll-buying pandemic that signalled the start of this crisis is over. I didn#t see a single person buy any.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By Margaret CanningApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTop business groups in the UK and Ireland have called for the Taoiseach and First and deputy First Ministers to co-operate to protect public health and restore prosperity following Covid-.The CBI in the UK and the Republic#s Ibec have today written a joint letter to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and to First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill.They are urging co-operation and co-ordination across the UK and Ireland to provide the best chance of protecting public health and restoring people#s prosperity.A memorandum of understanding for North-South co-operation on public health was signed by the departments of health in Northern Ireland and the Republic earlier this month. But today#s letter calls for economic co-operation to help the recovery.Ibec and the CBI said that it was in everyone#s interests for experts on both sides of the border to be in regular communication about each other#s plans for economic revival, including for all-island business and cross-border employment. They also suggest that parallel conversations should take place between the UK and Republic, suggesting the North South Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council as the framework for talks.And talks on co-ordination could also be held through meetings of the Tanaiste, First and deputy First Minister and the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, it suggests.The letter is signed by the CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn and Ibec chief executive Danny McCoy.It states that both organisations have been working through one of the most challenging periods for business that we can recall.It stresses existing and historic economic and political links between the UK and Ireland, including through the Good Friday Agreement and the Common Travel Area.It adds: As the coming weeks unfold, we all hope to make great progress with efforts to both suppress the virus and start planning for that much needed economic reboot. The business community is acutely aware of the deep economic impact on business and livelihoods that the measures to contain Covid- have had across these islands.It said that integrated supply chains for essential goods like medicines and pharmaceuticals were of immediate concern, and accounted for substantial trade between Ireland and the UK.The agri-food market across Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is at the forefront of all island business and indeed across the two islands agri-food products trade seamlessly - with Ireland being the UK#s second largest source of food imports and one of its largest markets for retail related exports. To support these supply chains and ensure that the measures taken in the recovery phase help to sustain the wide range of business activity between the two jurisdictions, we will need the highest level of co-operation, co-ordination and joined-up thinking.Ato daily movement of workers and goods between Northern Ireland and Irelandwill depend on the easing of current restrictions and alignment with medical advice. To support and re-energise the strong economic linkages, Ibec and CBI believe it is important and in everyone#s economic interests to have the experts on both sides of the island of Ireland regularly communicating on their respective economic restart plans.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.By Lauren HarteApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSome church services may resume and garden centres could reopen as part of a gradual easing of the lockdown, a Stormont minister has hinted.Edwin Poots, the Agriculture and Environment Minister, said he believes it is time to move towards a graduated response to reducing the restrictions. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said relaxing of restrictions will be reviewed early next week, depending on medical and scientic advice. At yesterday#s Executive briefing, Mr Poots said the public could feel hope following the recent reopening of cemeteries, pedestrian access to forest parks and public waste facilities. He suggested there could be a phased reopening of some churches that can adhere to social distancing, or #drive-in churches#, where people can still come together, eventhey do not leave their carsMr Poots said: As we move through the ious stages of this pandemic, of course our response, too, must change. And in order to flatten the curve, restrictions have been put in place to slow down the spread of the virus and to give us all a fighting chance in reducing the number of loved ones that we actually lose.This is the right thing to do. But the Executive has also tried to take a pragmatic, practical and sensible approach to our new norm.Mr Poots was asked about the prospect of reopening garden centres, which he said are places that could potentially have limited numbers and practise social distancing. Online sales have shielded some Northern Ireland garden centres from having to dump plants.But for others, Mr Poots said the alternative to not reopening them in the near future was the Executive offering a large compensation package.He said: The reality is that the materials they have to sell are not materials that can be sold in July, August or September.He added that there could be a potential additional cost to the Executive that we don#t really need to pay.Mr Poots signalled that church services could also begin again as part of a graduated unwinding of the restrictions.We can keep people with us by having a graduated response to it and ensuring that we do not put at risk or in jeopardy any further rise in this coronavirus or indeed a second wave of it whilst giving people a little more latitude to engage in some of the activities that they prefer to engage in.He said some larger churches could put in place social distancing measures or, where that is impossible, worship while remaining in cars may be allowed.Mr Poots said he would also consider whether to permit angling, given that it is a solitary sport that people engage in.They walk down to the side of a river, they do that on their own, he said. Where there is little impact, those are the things that we can graduate to.Mr Poots said easing some restrictions would make it easier for people to stay at home.He added: The purpose of these actions is to help people cope and stay at home longer. Small steps like this do not mean we drop our guard, it is not business as usual.We see the number of admissions to our hospital fall and we hope to see the number of deaths fall on a consistent basis.Ms Hargey acknowledged that many families and communities were having a dficult time due to the draconian measures.But she stressed the importance of remembering why the restrictions were imposed and said the Executive would learn from countries that were a couple of weeks in advance.This is about saving lives and we can see day on day that lives continue to be lost. What is clear is that we don#t want a second spike or those figures starting to increase again, she added. Ms Hargey also confirmed that there have been , applications for Universal Credit in Northern Ireland due to the pandemic, with  new applications made on April , and £.m of emergency support payments had been made.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Government bandwidth is stretched to its limit dealing with the public health emergency we#re facing.I have no confidence that it can sustain the pressure of Brexit negotiations on top of that, he added.A UK Government spokesperson said the Prime Minister has made clear he has no intention of changing the transition period deadline, adding: We have worked closely with the devolved administrations at every step of this process and will continue to keep them updated on the progress of negotiations, to ensure we have a future relationship that works for all parts of the UK.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is a black tie event and the saloon, library and dining room would all have been used during the evening. Hopefully we can rearrange it for a later date, depending on social distancing guidelines.Last November, Hope for Youth also bid for a charity dinner at the House of Lords versus House of Commons swim. It was due to take place in November but I think we#ll have to make a decision in July. On the whole, I#ve no doubt that the situation will have an impact on all historic homes.

It took four trips to AE before a CT scan revealed a kidney stone. I was admitted to hospital for two days and during that time they tested me for coronavirus. I had none of the listed symptoms, so when it came back positive it was a bit of a shock.For two of those days in hospital I was placed in a Covid- ward where most people were on ventilators and suffering other ailments. I was unlucky to get ill but very fortunate not to have symptoms of the virus. I#ve been feeling fine ever since, but I came out of it with a rather dferent perspective. Now, I just enjoy every day, spending time in spring sunshine, appreciating the beautul gardens.Covid-#s greatest sting is the lack of contact between friends and family.Yes, I am missing the social interaction from friends and family, Noel says. I find not seeing people during the day very strange but fortunately there#s WhatsApp calls and other means of communication. Now, whenever I think of friends far away or those I haven#t seen in a while, I make a point of calling them. So far I have resisted Zoom! But when we get back to normality we#ll appreciate meeting people all the more.What is he looking forward to most when le s to normal I think, at the end of the day, there will have to be re-evaluations. We#ll all get a clearer image of what is really important and have more awareness of others. I#m looking forward to brighter days.

Making the most of their historic legacy - the Park dates back to  while the house was built in  - they ventured down the hospitality and tourism route, becoming one of Northern Ireland#s top event and wedding destinations.Now, even in light of the pandemic, Rosalind remains upbeat.We#re so fortunate to have the gardens, she says. They keep us busy and give us plenty to do. We took the opportunity of having no weddings to do some repairs on the lawns - levelling and reseeding - but it needs the rain to get it growing again! It#s lovely having three of our children at home and although Cordelia is in lockdown in Italy where she lives with her husband, rugby player Ian McKinley, we keep in touch via the internet.The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding.

Initially, we didn#t think anything was wrong with him. He even passed his seven month hearing test. We took him everywhere, first to a Harley Street doctor then to Manchester University Hospital for further tests. Later we took him to Holland to a school for the deaf in St Michelgestel. He was five when we discovered he had autism. That was another shock but it also helped us make sense of the way he was. You know, people sometimes say #poor you#. My answer to that is, it#s not poor us - it#s poor James, he#s the one who has to cope. But he has done brilliantly and has thrived at Parkanaur College, near Dungannon, working in the gardening centre, the upholstery workshop and he loves cooking. I think he#s coping well with the lockdown.How did she explain the situation to James I told him the whole world is sick and we have to stay at home. I crossed out all the exciting things on his calendar - weddings, family parties, holidays. He has taken it well and is quite a happy chap.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJames Mulholland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJames MulhollandHow has the lockdown affected business It has been a real challenge, and we have so much sympathy for the couples who have had to re-think their wedding plans, but everyone has been so cooperative, she says. All weddings to the end of June have been postponed, and even some July dates have reserved a back-up slot just in case. The advantage of a private venue like Ballyscullion Park is that the only people around the estate on the day are those connected to the wedding. We hope that will work in our favour as lockdown eases. We are inviting couples who can#t get married on their chosen date to come for a picnic in the garden, once restrictions have eased. They will be able to enjoy the garden without anyone  around, so they can still make some happy memories for their day.What about tour groups All cancelled and I can#t see them starting up till much later in the year, Rosalind remarks. It is really hard for the hospitality industry. Mid Ulster Council has been fantastic and has organized regular Zoom presentations from key people in tourism, legal and financial experts and marketing gurus. Ironically,  was to be the year when so many businesses took off!‘Our BB is closed, weddings and events are cancelled ... we’re looking at ways to ersy’Just a few miles from Bushmills, Ballylough estate has been in the Traill family since . Down through the centuries, the beautul Georgian property has housed many distinguished residents, including Colonel William Traill, pioneer of the first commercially run hydro-electro powered tram system that once operated between Portrush and the Giant#s Causeway. In more recent times, current owners June and David Traill have put the historic property on the hospitality map, including running their house as a bed and breakfast.There is no farming here, so for us to make the property #wash its face# and bring in an income, we#ve had to come up with new business ideas, June explains.In keeping with our charity, Ballylough Living History Trust, we ran the popular event known as Battle of the Boar. I#m also interested in social prescription projects including taking therapies such as counselling outdoors. Now, everything is on hold.We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid June TraillOn March , my mother had a hip operation and when she came out of hospital three days later lockdown was just beginning. She needed three carers a day, so it was a no-brainer that I move in with her. I#ve been locked down at mum#s house ever since, while David looks after the house.June#s mum, Christine Wright, a well-known artist, isn#t the only one needing the Traills# help. We have some students from the charity staying at our house, she explains. They couldn#t get home as they live in remote Islands, as far away as Martinique. We all get on well and it#s great that they can keep in touch with their families via Skype and suchlike. We also have two of our sons at home. Henryand his brother Brucehave finished university but with the current situation I don#t know what#ll happen about finding jobs. Our other two boys, Shaneand Paddyare both working from home in England and, like everyone , we use the internet to stay connected.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJune and David Traill at their home in Bushmills FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJune and David Traill at their home in BushmillsCoronavirus has left the economy reeling and, as June points out, for many small businesses the prognosis is poor.Usually, our bed and breakfast funds a lot of the charity work, which we are continuing to support where possible. But now the BB is shut, which means our income is zero. We reinvested every penny into the business, so we had no profits. Weddings have been cancelled, which means refunding deposits that have already been used to upgrade the site. We have taken a mortgage holiday thanks to the support of our mortgage supplier, but other loans and costs still have to be paid.Sadly many, like those in the tourism sector who rely on a very short income period will be badly affected or, indeed, go under.June, however, maintains a glimmer of hope. I#m busy thinking of ways to ersy, she explains. We#ve had time to finish a little free publication about the heritage of the Ballylough area. We#ll be able to hand it out to visitors, guests and the local community. We#re also working on preserving and recreating some of the historical costumes on site, although no idea how we#ll eventually be able to showcase them. Meantime, we#re finishing all those little jobs that have waited for years to be done. The garden, in particular, is getting a lot more attention, so we have been planting plenty of veg and flowers.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We will continue to conduct patrols and checkpoints and you will see police patrols and checkpoints across Northern Ireland, for example at beauty spots, on roads going to key resorts and in border areas, he explained. If you don#t have a reasonable explanation for your travel, we will turn you back.ACC Todd said officers will take action against those who persist in breaking restrictions.He revealed that to date, a total of  fines and  Community Resolution Notices have been issued by officers.Mr Todd continued: We will continue to engage with people and explain what we need them to do and encourage them to follow the restrictions that are in place.For the small numbers continuing to ignore the restrictions, it is inevitable we will have to move to enforcement through penalty notices, but I would stress this is always a last resort.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Recognised internationally, it is a major national honour. Past Fellows and Foreign Members of the Royal Society have included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Dorothy Hodgkin and Stephen Hawking. Professor Smartt directly discovered the stars that explode as supernovae for the first time using the Hubble Space Telescope. He leads several teams that survey the sky every night, constantly scanning the data for anything that changes with computer algorithms. He uncovered evidence that massive stars can either collapse quietly to form black holes or produce the most luminous explosions in the Universe. He also led one of the teams that detected the source of gravitational waves, showing that merging neutron stars produce the heaviest radioactive elements in the periodic table. Professor Smartt is a global pioneer in the field of digital, time domain sky surveys. He said he was honoured and delighted to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. It is a huge privilege to join other scientic giants who have been appointed to the Society over the years, in recognition of my work and the level of scientic achievement at Queen#s, he said. Science impacts on all our lives, no more so than at present, and I look forward to progressing the Society#s purpose of promoting excellence in science and using it for the benefit of humanity. Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society, said: At this time of global crisis, the importance of scientic thinking, and the medicines, technologies and insights it delivers, has never been clearer.

In an ideal world, they would have received detailed scrutiny at the Assembly before becoming law. However, we are not living in an ideal world at present. The overriding priority at this time is protection of le. Regulations to enforce and encourage social distancing have a vital role to play in that regard. These regulations were introduced by the Department of Health, with support from all Executive Ministers. Responsibility for enforcing them rests with the Police. Regulations are never going to cover all potential aspects of human interaction and behaviour in a modern society. There will inevitably be some shades of grey. That’s the reality of le. The Police have rightly made clear that officers will apply a “reasonableness” test on occasions when decidingsome behaviours may breach the regulations. googletag.cmd.push The overriding principle in applying any reasonableness test is not what may be reasonable for people to want to do, but what is reasonable in achieving the aim of preventing the spread of the Covid- virus, balanced with other risks and considerations. Officers applying discretion are a regular feature of modern day policing. Discretion is by its nature case specic. Ultimately, any decisions can be challenged through the courts to determinethe “reasonableness” test has been correctly applied in all the circumstances. It should also be noted that people will routinely be given the option of complying with any requirement tohome without the need for any penalty to be imposed. Thankfully, the vast majority of people across our community are supportive and co-operative with these emergency measures. googletag.cmd.push Whilst understanding people’s desire for clarity in what constitutes an offence under the regulations, it is not always possible to give inidual answers for the countless hypothetical scenarios which may arise. Notwithstanding this, the public health guidance is clear: stay home and only leave home when it is essential. For our part, we are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.

The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Claire McMullan of Dental  in Magherafelt is currently volunteering at one of five Emergency Dental Treatment Hubs across Northern Ireland. The hubs were set up when a shortage in PPE made it impossible to supply every dental practice with the necessary equipment to carry out procedures safely. She told the County Derry Post: “From mid-March, we began postponing non urgent appointments. “This was to ease the number of patients coming through the practice as social distancing measures were introduced. By the end of that week we were treating emergency cases only. googletag.cmd.push “As dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses work in such close proximity to our patients while carrying out these procedures, we are at very high risk of personal exposure. “In order to protect our teams, patients and the wider community it is vital that we have the correct PPE and decontamination protocol to keep the risk to an absolute minimum. “At present there is a drastic shortage in the required PPE for Aerosol Generating Procedures .” Almost every procedure in dentistry creates an aerosol when the use of a drill, ultrasonic scaler, water or compressed air propels droplets of saliva into the air. googletag.cmd.push In order to prevent transmission of Covid- through these droplets, the Health and Social Care Board ceased all AGPs and all consultations are now carried out by telephone. “All patients requiring advice or emergency treatment are asked to phone the practice so the dentist can triage their call,” Claire explains. “If they require a simple dressing or extraction, we may be able to offer this in practicethe patient is not isolating, experiencing Covid- symptoms or been in contact with anyone experiencing symptoms.” “We will offer advice or prescription where possible. If the patient requires an AGP, for example, to begin root canal treatment, they will be referred to the Urgent Dental Centre . After an initial request for  volunteers, over  dentists came forward to staff the emergency hubs, but many are yet to reach operational capacity. This is due to the time it takes to process such a big number of volunteers and fit them with the appropriate PPE. Claire said: “Some volunteers are still waiting to be fitted for their FFP masks. Every dentist must be specially fitted for an FFP mask to safely carry out AGP. “Any patient who requires an emergency AGP is referred to the hub where dentists work in pairs wearing full PPE plastic gown, FFP mask, cap, full face visor, apron and gloves. “With the current lovely weather, working in all the PPE, in a surgery with no air conditioning or open windows has been a challenge!” Given the usual high standard of cross infection control in dentistry, there are concerns for practices when the Covid- pandemic eventually begins to recede. Ato normal within dentistry will require the correct standard of PPE, and Claire says there are concerns in sourcing and fitting the equipment, as well as how it will be funded. She said: “Our main concern is the urgent need for PPE so we can carry out normal dental treatment. “I think treatments will be reintroduced gradually to general dental practice. The Hubs will continue towhile the reintroduction is happening and there is a demand. “We will have to organise our diaries and treatments dferently to limit exposure, allow for more efficient use of PPE and leave time between appointments for settling and cleaning. “We are acutely aware of the effect Covid- limitations have on the population. Necessary treatment is being postponed and dental conditions are potentially worsening as a result. “It is vital that we get appropriate guidance, PPE and financial support to start caring for the population’s dental health as safely and quickly as possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ronan McIlvenny has been living in Wellington with his partner Oonagh Morley for almost two years and says the response to the pandemic has been well-received. “They announced a four-stage system when everything started,” said the Limavady native. “Stage  was just trying to control things. Stage  was people starting to work from home and stopping gatherings. Stage  was all non-essential businesses closed and Stage  was lockdown. “We were in full lockdown for four weeks. It was slightly stricter than at home, there were no takeaways or anything like that open, just the supermarkets and hospitals. googletag.cmd.push Initially, the country was toto Stage  on Friday, but the government made the decision to delay the move until after the Anzac Day bank holiday celebrations. From today, cafes will be able to offer takeaway and non-essential businesses such as physio practices can open, but schools will remain shut, with restriction remaining on movement. Ronan believes the country’s response to the pandemic has greatly reduced its effect on the country. He said: “People here are being very strict. You’re still not allowed to meet anybody who’s not in your house, but people are supportive because the number of cases has stayed so low. googletag.cmd.push “All the lockdown restrictions came in here around the same time as at home, but because we were a few weeks behind in terms of cases, it never got out of control. “They completely closed the borders and didn’t let any tourists into the country. If we left the country, we wouldn’t get back in because we’re not New Zealand citizens. “We know two people who got stranded in Ireland, who were home for a holiday. They are probably still paying rent and they have to get someone to send their stuff home.”  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the pandemic but has also achieved respect for how she dealt with the Christchurch shooting last March. “I don’t know how popular she is in terms of day-to-day policies, but she is really well liked as a leader,” said Ronan. “She handled the Christchurch massacre really well last year and she is handling this well. Everyone is happy to believe what she says – it’s the opposite of Boris Johnson in the UK. Experiencing lockdown on the other side of the globe has had a sobering effect on the -year-old secondary school teacher. “It’s the first time I’ve really felt like I don’t live in Ireland anymore,” he said. “We came here planning to live here for a year and although we’ve stayed a bit longer, it still felt like an extended holiday that we could end when we wanted. Now we can’t leave. “A friend’s brother died of a cardiac arrest at the weekend and he couldn’t get home. That’s the worst-case scenario.” Like many of us, Ronan is turning to nostalgia to fill the monotonous days under lockdown and reaching for the glory days that remind him of home. “I watched Derry’s ’ All-Ireland win on YouTube the other day again, so that was a good use of a few hours!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ronan McIlvenny has been living in Wellington with his partner Oonagh Morley for almost two years and says the response to the pandemic has been well-received. “They announced a four-stage system when everything started,” said the Limavady native. “Stage  was just trying to control things. Stage  was people starting to work from home and stopping gatherings. Stage  was all non-essential businesses closed and Stage  was lockdown. “We were in full lockdown for four weeks. It was slightly stricter than at home, there were no takeaways or anything like that open, just the supermarkets and hospitals. googletag.cmd.push Initially, the country was toto Stage  on Friday, but the government made the decision to delay the move until after the Anzac Day bank holiday celebrations. From today, cafes will be able to offer takeaway and non-essential businesses such as physio practices can open, but schools will remain shut, with restriction remaining on movement. Ronan believes the country’s response to the pandemic has greatly reduced its effect on the country. He said: “People here are being very strict. You’re still not allowed to meet anybody who’s not in your house, but people are supportive because the number of cases has stayed so low. googletag.cmd.push “All the lockdown restrictions came in here around the same time as at home, but because we were a few weeks behind in terms of cases, it never got out of control. “They completely closed the borders and didn’t let any tourists into the country. If we left the country, we wouldn’t get back in because we’re not New Zealand citizens. “We know two people who got stranded in Ireland, who were home for a holiday. They are probably still paying rent and they have to get someone to send their stuff home.”  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has been widely praised for her response to the pandemic but has also achieved respect for how she dealt with the Christchurch shooting last March. “I don’t know how popular she is in terms of day-to-day policies, but she is really well liked as a leader,” said Ronan. “She handled the Christchurch massacre really well last year and she is handling this well. Everyone is happy to believe what she says – it’s the opposite of Boris Johnson in the UK. Experiencing lockdown on the other side of the globe has had a sobering effect on the -year-old secondary school teacher. “It’s the first time I’ve really felt like I don’t live in Ireland anymore,” he said. “We came here planning to live here for a year and although we’ve stayed a bit longer, it still felt like an extended holiday that we could end when we wanted. Now we can’t leave. “A friend’s brother died of a cardiac arrest at the weekend and he couldn’t get home. That’s the worst-case scenario.” Like many of us, Ronan is turning to nostalgia to fill the monotonous days under lockdown and reaching for the glory days that remind him of home. “I watched Derry’s ’ All-Ireland win on YouTube the other day again, so that was a good use of a few hours!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Rubbish reported on the Augagaskin Road and Sersons Road areas of Magherafelt has left locals incensed and led to calls from some members of the public for skips to be reopened. Northern Ireland Water has highlighted a spate of fly-tipping at a number of its reservoirs, which has potential to lead to a strain on resources. Head of Water, Brian McCalmont, called for an immediate halt to the behaviour. He said: “We are calling for this illegal dumping to stop immediately. googletag.cmd.push “In light of water being essential throughout Covid-, it is even more important to respect this, and to ensure our workers have unhindered access to our facilities. “Those responsible are not only breaking the law by dumping waste but are also creating a needless drain on resources for NI Water that could be better used to improve services. “With Council facilities closed because of the coronoavirus pandemic this is a selfish act that impacts on everyone.” Mid Ulster District Council says they are ‘actively pursuing’ those involved in fly-tipping within their council area. A spokesperson said: “It is a criminal offence to dump waste illegally and can result in a fine or possible prosecution. googletag.cmd.push “The decision to close recycling centres was made to allow us to re-deploy our staff to other priority areas to deliver essential services to citizens for as long as possible. “We believe that by remaining open, we would also be encouraging travel which is not essential. “There is unlikely to be any immediate change, given the continuing restrictions on essential travel, the social distancing measures which remain in place and our own service priorities. “There is no excuse for fly tipping at any time and we would urge people to think about the amount of waste they generate during this time and how they can reduce it. “We are actively pursuing a number of investigations into fly tipping illegal waste disposal and are working closely with NIEA- the NI Waste Regulator in this regard. Over the last few weeks, a number of community groups have been taking matters into their own hands by organising litter picks among their members. GAA clubs in Glen and Bellaghy were out in force to clean up their areas last week, while residents in Magherafelt will meet this afternoon in the Aughrim Road area of the town. Causeway Coast and Glens Council said they would not encourage this kind of organised litter pick, but that they would be supportive of continuing efforts to keep roads litter-free. A spokesperson said: “Since  we have been working cooperatively to empower a range of partners working at community level. “This support has included the provision of litter pickers, bags and a collection service where necessary. “WhileCouncil would discourage organised community litter picks at this time, this work continues throughout the pandemic with smaller scale inidual and family action. “Council is encouraging people to lt litterthey wish to do so but only as part of their daily exercise routine and ensuring safe social distancing at all times.” Mid Ulster District Council has been actively supporting the initiatives, which were conducted in line with social distancing, and has removed the bagged litter resulting from the picks. A spokesperson said: “Where groups can adhere to social distancing guidance and ensure the health and safety of participants, we are content to continue to support community-based clean ups where we can.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The current coronavirus pandemic means that all schools across the city are currently closed but last year the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School.  The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only Integrated school on the West Bank of the city. A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and new Education Minister Peter Weir at the beginning of this year. googletag.cmd.push Now, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “As a result of the COVID- emergency situation Area Planning activity has largely been paused, with available resources deployed in support of the Department’s emergency response to COVID-. “The school will be advised as soon as any decision has been made, however an exact timeframe for a decision cannot be given at this time.” The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. googletag.cmd.push Following that decision numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. One parent, Diana McLaughlin, previously told the Derry News that uncertainty surrounding the school’s future and looming transfer tests meant she had to take the ‘dficult decision’ to move her son and daughter where. The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. ‘DISAGREE’ A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the waterside. It caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. EA therefore recommends that Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School discontinues with effect from  August .

The call for the loud voice from the city came from SDLP Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin. “I am angry and frustrated,” she said. “Our city has been waiting far too long for the expansion of Magee – half a century, in fact. But it has also been waiting an absurdly long time for the Medical School to get the go-ahead. And this remains the case, even though the SDLPs leader Colum Eastwood secured additional money from the UK government as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. googletag.cmd.push “It is time for the Department of Health, Department for the Economy and Department of Finance, and their ministers, to end this game of pass the parcel – or pass the blame – and make the decision to approve the Medical School and deliver it. The people of Derry have now run out of patience and we have all nearly run out of time to get this over the line. “It is obvious that we need the Medical School in Derry. We have a chronic shortage of doctors in the North West. The establishment of the Medical School will help to put that right. googletag.cmd.push “Many people owe their lives to the work of medical professionals over recent weeks. But the truth is that we need more of them. Let us treat the medical profession with respect, by recognising their work and the risks they have taken, by paying them properly, by providing sufficient personal protection equipment for their needs and by training enough doctors and other health professionals to do the job that we expect them to do. “So I say to the people of Derry, please come together and shout as loud as you can to tell the political leaders and senior civil servants of Northern Ireland that they must this time do the right thing and give the go-ahead for the Magee Medical School.” People of Derry and the rest of the north can respond to the call by sending emails to politicians, as well as sharing social media posts, using the hashtag #MedicalSchoolforDerry. Sinead McLaughlin is deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee and intends to raise at today’s meeting of the committee the need for an urgent, positive, decision on the Medical School.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

The first instalment of a two part interview, in todays County Derry Post, charts the all-star forwards GAA career. He felt any chance of landing Sam disappeared when his team of the s failed to deliver in Croke Park. Derry won three Ulster senior titles in the decade and lost the  to All-Ireland finalists Armagh. Coleman then managed a team, which included Gerrys younger brother Eddie, an All-Ireland minor title in  and it started to look good again, McElhinney felt. googletag.cmd.push Gerry played for Derry from  as a  year-old debutant until , before joining Bolton Wanderers to pursue a soccer. “I was over the All-Ireland in .

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone. Its been really nice to hear from people who remember her. I picked up the picture and it really made day. It was so emotional. Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The Mayor is asking local children to send her either a picture, which can be accompanied by a short story, or alternatively to write a poem that focuses on the positive things that they have enjoyed despite this uncertain time. The competition will be broken up into two age groups – primary one to primary three children, aged - years old, and primary four to primary seven children, aged -. googletag.cmd.push Entries are open from todayand will close in two weeks time when the Mayor will select a winner and a runner up for each category from each age group and they will receive a goody bag of prizes. Mayor Boyle said that she wanted to give young people within the District a way of expressing their feelings creatively, while also praising them for how well they have handled the current situation. I have been so impressed with how well the children of our District have done in dealing with this strange time we are in. I know so many of them would love to be out playing in the sunshine with their friends, but they have been so good in following all of the rules and in listening to their parents and s to keep themselves, and all of us, safe. I think they should all be really proud of themselves. googletag.cmd.push Although Im sure there were a few excited faces about getting out of school, its still important to do some fun learning activities at home. This initiative is a great way to do that while also getting to draw and write down how you feel and the parts that you have enjoyed about the last few months, like spending lots of time with your family. I am so excited to read and see all the pictures, stories and poems. I already know it will be impossible to pick a winner because we have so many talented boys and girls! Entries can be submitted by emailing mayor@derrystrabane. Please include your contact details and the name and age of the child. The deadline for entries is Tuesday, May .

The Cornerstone City Church is based in the Duke Street building that was previously home to the Red Rooms nightclub. It also houses the churchs Hope Centre which offers food and clothing banks, counsellors and money management help and advice. The Hope Centre has been forced to close due to the coronavirus, but the drive-through food bank service allows them to continue their charitable work whilst observing social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Church elder, John Loughrey, explained: People are able to drive straight in off the Duke Street Roundabout and we have staff in high vis jackets to direct them. When they come in we just ask them to pop their boot open and we can place the bags of food inside. They dont even have to get out of their car. They are only there for a few minutes and it means we can still serve people the best we can. Mr Loughery said the recipients of the food parcels, which contain tinned and dried goods and fresh vegetables, have been very grateful. googletag.cmd.push There was a man who contacted us on Facebook andhe has seven kids. He said you have no idea what this means to me And there was another woman who rang for help and we left her round three bags of food. She rang us back in tears saying this is exactly what I need. We are here tohelp. If Jesus was here he wouldnt be sitting with the rich and famous hed be among the people. As the Cornerstone City Church cannot hold services at the moment it has moved them online. We usually have people from across the city coming to our church, said Mr Loughery. There are people from the Protestant community and the Catholic community. Were here to worship God. People are searching for something right now. There are people that are coming to us for food and they are wondering what are they about  They are sussing us out and thats great. “Our online videos have been shared and viewed thousands of times,” said Mr Loughrey.

The Ballinascreen man told the County Derry Post how he decided to make the most of the collection of music he had amassed. He said: “I’ve a good bit of music gathered up so I thought I’d give it a go. I got a good slot on a Saturday night and I’ve stuck to it. googletag.cmd.push “There are a lot of lorry drivers there who would follow it for the craic and a lot of friends here and in America have shared it too. “A pile of people started sending me friend requests and I got messages telling me to keep at it, that I was raising people’s spirits. “The first week I had around  followers and by the second week it had grown to nearly .” Lockdown may have dragged for many people, but Damien has been keeping things light and doing his best to please those who are tuning in to hear his set. googletag.cmd.push “I try and keep it good and lively and not slow it down, just a mixture of everything – s and s and things for all ages,” he said. “I’m trying to play the right sort of music and keep everybody happy. I set up every Saturday night and the feedback has been great from people and other entertainers. “It’s about having a party in your own living room, lt the spirits and keep everybody up and going. I’ll keep it going as long as everyone enjoys it. “There are people up in Cavan that I deliver from in the lorry and they’re all watching it on a Saturday night with a drink in the house.”  The lorry driver says he is trying to replicate the feeling of a Saturday night out and is encouraged by the many people interacting with each other on the Facebook feed. “Getting people to talk among each other is great, it seems to be everybody’s highlight on a Saturday night.” said Damien, who is known locally as ‘Big Dee’. “People would send me messages looking for shout outs. I’d spend a good half hour beforehand reading through them and looking for birthdays and anniversaries and the like. “It’s great when you get the feedback through Facebook, especially afterwards when you see how many people have liked it, shared it and viewed it.” Damien broadcasts live on his Facebook page – damien.groogan – from around .pm every Saturday night and freely admits to enjoying himself during the set. “You’re living a Saturday night out but from the comfort of your own living room,” he said. “I do a three-hour set butflies in because everybody is enjoying it. I might even take a wee beer myself during it!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup. Swapped blue and white stripes for Candy ones later in the decade and a treble was duly delivered. Can now be seen leading punters a merry dance in music venues across the north-west. googletag.cmd.push And McWilliams had a message for anyone who believes that Colombian star Carlos should have got in to his side ahead of Healy. You can stick your Valderrama up your Bogside, he writes.

The working paper has been drafted following a video conference between all three parties on Tuesday when the PFAI submitted a high-level paper prepared by their world governing body FIFPRO on protocols around player safety. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the FAI’s working document - entitled ‘Return To Football – Behind Closed Doors’ - around best practice for the staging of matches when senior Irish football gets the green light to resume action from the HealthService Executive . googletag.cmd.push This document incorporates all elements around the safe staging of games behind closed doors to ensure the health and safety of players, match officials and club employees and volunteers. All clubs have been asked to assess the document andtheir views to the working group. NLEC chairperson Noel Byrne said: “This working document is the next step in assessing what is best for Irish footballthe HSE and the Government give the green light for ato action, but behind closed doors. The document is the produce of very fruitful, positive and considered talks between the NLEC, the FAI and the PFAI. googletag.cmd.push “It is vital that we examine what is needed in the event of games going on in closed stadiums, from a health and safety perspective for all stakeholders and from a financial aspect as far as the clubs are concerned. This document, produced by all stakeholders working together, presents options to the clubs and we look forward to their views when they have had a chance to study the document.” PFAI General Secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “We welcome the opportunity to be part of this very important debate in these dficult times for Irish football. Our players are keen to support the efforts of the FAI and the NLEC to examine ato football in a manner that is safe for all involved be they players, match officials or club staff. “The FIFPRO document is a high-level recommendation and the FAI have put together the fine details of what playing behind closed doors looks like for all concerned. This is very much a work in progress with all stakeholders working together towards the best solution possible for our game in the event of a closed doors recommendation from the HSE and Government.” The FAI and the NLEC remain committed to looking at alternative income streams for SSE Airtricity League clubs in the event of ato National League football behind closed doors, with live streaming opportunities under discussion. Interim Deputy CEO of the FAI, Niall Quinn said: “The working document presented to the clubs today offers a real  for debate about ato football when we get the go-ahead from Government and health officials. They will of course have the final say on when weand under what circumstances, but it is imperative on us as a working group to present the best options available to our clubs. “This document offers the clubs an insight into best practice for staging games behind closed doors. The Association also remains committed to exploring the best financial proposition available to our clubs and players at this time. Analysis of the financial impact of playing behind doors is well underway with our clubs and we are examining potential revenue streams from live streaming and other sources. This is a united effort and we look forward to further engagement with the NLEC, the PFAI, the referees and the clubs themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/11294674.jpg?htype=360\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nathan carter concert helps heroes fund top  ","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Let’s be very clear - in terms of the public response to coronavirus, the public has been hugely responsible.“And having engaged in this for six weeks, I don’t believe that giving the public small steps back to normality – very small steps, baby steps – that all of a sudden people are going to become irresponsible. The people who would be irresponsible in those circumstances are irresponsible before.”He said that those breaking the law by holding events such as house parties were acting in ways which are “not appropriate”, but added: “We do not deal with the wider public by taking the view that the irresponsible might have”.Priority supermarket delivery slots for the elderly coming to NI ‘soon’Elderly and vulnerable people should soon be able to get priority online booking slots for supermarkets, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey has said.On Monday the News Letter revealed that Northern Ireland is the final part of the UK where that remains impossible because Stormont has been unable to get its database to shops.Ms Hargey said that was “unfortunate” but that rather than one central database, as in England, there are more than  databases in GP surgeries and there has been issues getting supermarkets to agree to sign agreements about how they would use the data.She said she hoped to a positive announcement “very shortly”.Ms Hargey said that the reason that the death toll had been less than initially feared was that the public had been “amazing” in adhering “stringently” to health advice and also the restrictions.\u2028She said that the regulations would be reviewed next week, but “now is not the time for complacency the concern would be thatyou start to knee-jerk without a planned relaxation of the regulations that you could set that [deaths] figure to go in the opposite direction again”.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They should be considering putting staff on furlough before redundancy. They don’t seem to have applied government guidelines on this, which initially urge redeployment of staff at present and then to consider furloughs as a last resort.”Mr Thomas said all  workers were eligible for furlough, even agency staff.Askedother councils are considering laying off staff he replied that, based on information provided by Nipsa members across local authorities, “all [] councils are looking at options. One council is not doing anything at the moment while others have applied for confirmation about furloughing staff. We know of one formal application for furloughs from a council”.Antrim and Newtownabbey Sinn Fein councillor Michael Goodman said his party opposed the proposals, while SDLP councillor Ryan Wilson said the Northern Ireland Local Government Association has encouraged councils to avail of the furlough scheme. The BBC reported last night that the council was still in talks with unions over the  jobs and that Fermanagh and Tyrone Borough Council believes its staff are eligible for furlough. Belfast, Newry, Mourne and Down and Derry City and Strabane councils all said they had not made any similar decisions on staffing.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireLast year, while there was no Stormont Executive, civil servants in the Department for the Economy proposed radical cuts to RHI subsidies which had been guaranteed for  years, cutting the earning potential of a typical boiler by %.The then secretary of state Karen Bradley brought those changes to Westminster where they were rubber-stamped.At the time, the Department for the Economyconfidently said that those with RHI boilers would not revert to fossil fuels because wood pellets are the cheapest form of fuel on the market and therefore it would not make sense for anyone with a biomass boiler to switch to a more expensive fuel.However, as part of Westminster passing the changes, the House of Lords asked civil servants to have their work independently examined to ensure that it was not leading to hardship for those who had entered the scheme in good faith. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Yesterday that report, by energy consultant Andrew Buglass, was published – some five months after it was meant to have been completed.His report finds that contrary to civil servants’ claims, a signicant percentage of RHI claimants to whom he spoke have either reverted to gas or are considering doing so.He also found multiple examples of how Stormont’s behaviour towards legitimate RHI claimants has left them in hardship – not just financially, where some claimants had liquidated their pensions or sold land in order to keep up loan repayments for the boilers Stormont urged them to install – but also a signicant impact on mental health.He said that claimants had told him of “knock-on effects in relationships and families, with recriminations among family members or heated disagreements on what action should be taken as a result”, ill-health attributed to the scheme, or in one case a man who said that “his children had faced bullying in school as a result” of it being known that he was a claimant.He said that some RHI claimants felt that “those who had been guilty of inflating claims for heat should have been pursued more vigorously, and that slowness and some opacity in the audit process had not helped illustrate that abusers of the scheme were in fact a very small proportion of the participants”.Mr Buglass suggested that Stormont could now – as some claimants want – simply replicate the GB tarf levels.That is unlikely, but earlier this week DfE, which is now under DUP minister Diane Dodds, said that it was considering increasing the tarfs for the most popular kw boilers by %. However, that would still leave them far behind the situation in GB and Ireland.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

Recently mart operators trialled a number of successful online sales to enable livestock trading to continue and are now gradually moving towards re-opening on a phased basis from next Monday, with some restrictions in place.In welcoming the decision, a spokesman said: “Farmers are key workers and are continuing to provide food for us all in very challenging circumstances. Part of that food supply chain is the ability to trade and sell animals.“Staff within the Department have maintained regular contact with Livestock Mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the Marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements.“DAERA therefore welcomes the decision to recommence sales of primestock, cull animals and store stock on a gradual basis from week commencing  April.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aeaceebadcadcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dedfbfeecde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
