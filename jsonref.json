But it’s a sad reality of being a priest in London that I have to be ready with the last rites at all times.’Mr Lee, who appeared on last week’s Question Time to condemn the failure of politicians to get to grips with the knife-crime crisis, said he believes putting a stop to low-level crime would be a good start.‘I look around London and I see Sadiq Khan – who seems to be more focused on what Donald Trump is saying – and a lot of other politicians squabbling over Brexit, and it’s not surprising knife crime is as bad as it is,’ he said.‘I’m a firm believer that we need to take a stronger stance on low-level crime. If we can stop the littering and the loitering, people will start to be proud of themselves and of the area they live in.‘That kind of attitude will help curb violent crime in this country.’         Mr Lee, who took over the tough inner-city parish in August last year, said that his parents had been uneasy about his move to Tottenham with his wife and two young children because of London’s knife crime epidemicMr Lee, who is also a county commissioner for Greater London North East Scouts, revealed that he once met the murdered schoolgirl Jodie Chesney.The 17-year-old Explorer Scout was stabbed to death in an East London park in March. ‘I wouldn’t want to overstate my relationship with Jodie but I did meet her and she was, by all accounts, an extraordinary young woman with everything ahead of her,’ he said.‘Scouting is the kind of pursuit that gives skills for life. I’ve met so many incredible people who are involved with the Scouts and it’s horrifying to think a Scout could be caught up in knife crime in such a tragic way.’The vicar, who grew up in Ilford, East London, left school at 16 with only four GCSEs and few prospects, but said he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and believes the same mentality could help young people today.‘My teenage years were very wayward, to say the least,’ he added. ‘I always joke that I left school with hardly anything to show for myself but ended up studying at Oxford, which is where I did my priest training. If I can turn things around then anyone can.’Of the dangers he and his family face in Tottenham, Mr Lee said: ‘My wife thinks I can be cavalier because of what this area is like, but I have a job to do and I feel I need to get out and talk to people.‘It’s no good pointing the finger at others if I’m not willing to do everything I can to turn knife crime around.’"},{"url":null,"title":"After 4 000 years scientists set unlock secrets Bronze Age dagger covered gold shards","story":"Share this article Experts believe only children aged no more than ten would have been capable of such delicate handicraft.

Her plight is harder to bear because her elder sister Kemi, with whom she lives in East London, has always been a British citizen as she was born before the changes to the Act. Ms Thomas believes she is a victim of the Home Office becoming over-zealous after then Home Secretary Theresa May introduced a ‘hostile environment’ towards illegal migrants in 2012.The policy resulted in the Windrush scandal, which saw dozens of long-standing British citizens deported because they lacked papers proving their right to be in the country.Ms Thomas, 36, who has performed on the BBC, said: ‘My parents came here at the end of the Windrush era.‘I had a National Insurance number, I had my birth certificate, I’d got a driving licence, a bank account, I went to college. At no point during that process was there any indication I was doing anything incorrectly. I believe that I am British.’Although she was born in Scotland, Ms Thomas lived with her father in Nigeria between the ages of three and 18. She thought she had dual British-Nigerian nationality when she returned to Britain. She applied for a UK passport when she was 25 but she was refused. She was granted temporary discretionary leave to remain and told she could apply for permanent residency.But two weeks ago, Ms Thomas received a letter saying her application had been unsuccessful, and that she had to leave within 14 days or appeal, or face detention and deportation without notice.         New rules require documentary evidence of the right to be here, which many Windrush children do not have as anyone who arrived in the UK from a Commonwealth country before 1971 was given indefinite leave to remain, meaning many did not apply for a British passportThe letter revealed her right to remain had been granted only because she had been in a long-term relationship with a British citizen. It went on to explain that her right was withdrawn after she told the Home Office that the relationship had ended.She said: ‘I thought it was about my own situation having been born here and spent all my adult life here, but they weren’t interested in that.’She has chosen to appeal on human rights grounds and her case has been taken up by Liberal Democrat peer Lord Roberts, who intends to bring up her case with a Home Office Minister. But Ms Thomas remains in limbo as her case could take up to eight months to reach its conclusion. Her US performing debut at the Ford Theatre in Los Angeles in October is now in doubt and she estimates that fighting her case so far has cost £7,000 in legal fees.Ms Thomas’s lawyer, Fahad Ahmed, said she missed out on automatic citizenship by a matter of months and added: ‘Courts take a less harsh view than the Home Office, and if someone can prove their life is here, the courts will use their discretion.’The Home Office said: ‘All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits.’Ironically, Ms Thomas’s story emerged as the first National Windrush Day was held yesterday – and as Mrs May announced that a memorial to the Windrush Generation will be built at Waterloo Station in London as a legacy to ‘their tremendous contribution’ to Britain. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/23/00/15128488-0-image-m-38_1561247427197.jpg","title":"Dame Judi Dench adopts three orangutans heading depths Borneo","story":"Share this article She also gets to observe a Kubong  - a gliding mammal which can fly for over 100 metres - along with more than a million bats, a dung beetle called Bob and a snake she names James Bond - no doubt a reference to her turn as M in various 007 films, including Skyfall.At one point, she says: \u0027Here we are on a Wednesday morning up this incredible river.

Groovy baby!When the clerks of Camden’s highways department were issuing parking fines from their gloomy office in the 1970s, little can they have imagined that jet-setting hipsters would one day be supping cocktails in the public library below them before taking an al fresco dip up on the roof. Maligned for years as the concrete “egg box” of Euston Road, the old council headquarters have been reborn as the glamorous Standard Hotel, the first outpost of the risque boutique chain outside the US.“People thought we were crazy to suggest open-air bathtubs in London,” says Shawn Hausman, the Los Angeles-based designer behind the Standard’s flamboyant interiors, who started out creating film sets for Saturday Night Fever. “But I think it’s always nice to have a bath outside, even in the rain.”Naked bodies bobbing above the rooftops is par for the course for a chain with a reputation for racy touches. Its first hotel, which opened on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in 1999, features live models in a vitrine behind the reception desk, part of an art installation called The Box. Its New York flagship, which straddles the High Line park, takes voyeurism to the next level via the celebrity-frequented Boom Boom Room, an exclusive club that boasts four sitdown toilets in a single cubicle.Then there are its full-height bedroom windows, which have given the hotel a reputation as a site of sexual exhibitionism (encouraged by raunchy scenes in Steve McQueen’s film Shame being shot there). The price of a room is listed on the restaurant’s dessert menu, and where other hotels put the Gideon Bible, here you’ll find condoms and ibuprofen. Is this what’s in store for what was, until recently, a bastion of council bureaucracy? Built in 1977 by Camden’s esteemed in-house architects’ department, the town hall annexe had long been seen as a concrete carbuncle. It was listed in the local conservation area plan as making a “negative contribution”, its rough pre-cast facade looming across the road from George Gilbert Scott’s gothic fantasy of St Pancras station like a cheese-grater.When Scott’s creation was reborn as luxury apartments and a swanky hotel in 2011, it was only a matter of time before Camden cashed in on the location and architectural heritage of its own offices. Such muscular works of brutalism were rapidly becoming the subject of coffee-table books and tea towels – and being eyed up by trendy hotel chains looking to make a statement.Facing hefty repair bills for lifts and services, the council sold the leaky hulk in 2014 for almost £60m, transferring its offices to a new block just to the north, saving an estimated £500,000 a year. For the Standard, which had been scouting in London for a decade, it was the perfect fit. “We thought all we needed to do was put a logo on it,” says managing director Bruce Robertson.The reality wasn’t so simple. To make the project viable, a three-storey “crown” has been added, supported by threading new steel columns through the existing structure, whose facade has been scrubbed a gleaming white, while the brown-tinted windows have been replaced with clear curved glazing specially manufactured by a boatbuilding company. Orms architects have made it look as good as new, finishing it off with a jaunty red bubble lift so guests can feel like they’re being shuttled up the facade in a flying phone box.This flash of glossy red is a hint of what lies within. Anyone who remembers queueing up inside the council’s concrete colossus to sort out their housing benefit won’t recognise the place. Working with interior architects Archer Humphryes, Hausman’s team has conjured a surreal vision of swinging London: a souped-up Austin Powers world of enamel optical-art murals and moulded ceramic wall features, with a hoard of vintage furniture sourced from the jazziest corners of eBay.“We were inspired by a range of movies, from Fahrenheit 451 to Silent Running and Logan’s Run,” says Hausman, “as well as the iconic aesthetics of the London Underground. Mid-century Italian design played a big part too.”A reception desk striped with exotic hardwoods stands in front of a bulging blue and red ceramic wall by Lubna Chowdhary, recalling the Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road station, while a chunky pink terrazzo floor leads visitors through to what was once St Pancras public library. It is now a lounge bar themed around an imagined 1970s library, complete with an in-house librarian who will curate a selection of “radical” books.“The original library was not so aesthetically pleasing,” says Hausman, “so we’ve invented the kind we would have liked to find here.” It is evidently the fictional library of a design aficionado: alongside retro veneered bookshelves are collectible pieces of Memphis furniture, baggy leather Saporiti sofas, and a ceiling dotted with red globe fixtures. To one side stands a “sounds lounge” recording booth, where musicians and DJs will make podcasts and record interviews, while around the corner lies the first of several restaurants, complete with a “fermentation bar”.The interiors exude the retro charm of a Wes Anderson film set, but there is something unsavoury about a place once designed for public services being co-opted as a luxury lifestyle destination. It’s like Hackney’s former Asian Women’s Advisory Service being crassly reborn as The Advisory hipster burger bar. At least in this case, St Pancras library has a bright new home in the Kings Cross development, where a new public swimming pool and leisure centre have also been provided beneath the new council offices – an amenity the hotel itself lacks.The Standard claims its ground floor will be as “democratic” as possible, with a e bar-style venue spilling on to a passage, and a new public garden to the south where a closed route has been opened up. It was the only bidder for the site that proposed keeping the building – others planned to raze it in favour of a tower. When brutalist gems like the nearby Welbeck Street car park are being demolished to make way for lumpen new hotels, the vision to reuse such a massive concrete edifice should be applauded.The bedrooms – which range from £150 to over £1,000 per night – continue the transport theme, with the curved windows recalling those of a ferry, along with tightly pleated train-style curtains and bold geometric bedspreads by Wallace \u0026amp Sewell (fabric designers for Transport for London) complementing window seats in burgundy Harris tweed. Suspended ceilings have been ripped out to reveal the concrete waffle-slabs, while the open-plan bathrooms are an on-trend Pinterest board come alive, with riotous symphonies of bubblegum pink and navy blue tiles punctuated by mint taps.Others aren’t as appealing. Across the boldly-carpeted corridors – designed as “an archaeological dig of 1970s patterns” – lie what are being marketed as “Cosy Core” rooms, a euphemism for windowless bunkers. It is here that the challenges of converting a deep-plan office into a functioning hotel are most sorely felt – a substantial block of rooms in the centre won’t enjoy a chink of daylight.“It would be illegal in the US,” Hausman admits, “but here it was a great opportunity to exceed expectations of what a windowless room could be.” Aimed at jet-lagged travellers and nocturnal party animals, the rooms have a loungey hungover vibe, with low corner-sofas that meld into the beds, and long wood-floored showers filled with plastic plants in the hope of distracting guests from their light-starved existence.The heady climax, which won’t open until later in the year, is found at the top of the crown, where one side will be a Latin-themed restaurant run by a double-Michelin-starred chef, imagined as a 1970s tropical plant-strewn lair of macramé curtains, rattan ceiling panels and raised terraces of crazy paving.On the other side will be an opulent 24-hour-licensed venue with faceted mirror ceilings, leather banquettes and what the designers describe as a “big, boisterous, spectacular curtain”, drawn back to reveal five-metre high curved windows looking out over King’s Cross – London’s very own version of New York’s Boom Boom Room.Longtime local residents will be astonished that such a thing could ever appear on the Euston Road, but it completes the rapid mutation of this once-seedy district  into London’s gilded “gateway to Europe”, where the likes of Google, LVMH and Universal Music rub shoulders with one of the country’s best art schools, Central Saint Martin’s – and where rooftop bathers will now be able to wave across to hedge fund managers living in the former railway offices of St Pancras.

But now a portrait of one of history’s most formidable women by one of the world’s greatest painters has been rediscovered – and it will go under the hammer next month.The Portrait of Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj, painted in the mid-17th century by the Spanish master Diego Velázquez, has undergone painstaking authentication and conservation by Sotheby’s since it was brought to the auction house’s Amsterdam office 18 months ago.With an estimated price of £2m-£3m, it could be bought by either a private collector or a world-class museum. “Velázquez is one of the absolute stand-out titans of European and world painting. This portrait is unquestionably of interest to scholars and admirers of Velázquez alike,” said James Macdonald, Sotheby’s senior specialist in Old Master paintings.It is also a rare depiction of the most influential, avaricious and manipulative woman in 17th-century Rome. Olimpia Maidalchini Pamphilj was the power behind the papal throne, and the reputed lover as well as sister-in-law of Pope Innocent X. Nicknamed Papessa – the lady pope – Donna Olimpia was an ardent feminist, championing Rome’s prostitutes and nuns alike.She was a “baroque rock star”, according to Eleanor Herman, author of Mistress of the Vatican: the True Story of Olimpia Maidalchini. “Women from all over the Catholic world came to Rome to station themselves outside her palace and cheer as her carriage rolled out.“They could not believe that a female from modest beginnings had risen to such heights, running the nation of the Papal States and the Catholic church, an institution where women were not – and still are not – allowed any power at all.”Donna Olimpia determined foreign policy and chose cardinals. Kings and queens across Europe sent gifts of gold and diamonds to curry favour. No decision was taken by Pope Innocent before consulting his sister-in-law. “People in Rome hung banners over the pope’s name on public buildings that read Pope Olimpia I. Medals were minted showing her wearing the papal tiara and sitting on the throne of St Peter,” said Herman.But the men of the papal court despised and feared her. One cardinal deplored the “monstrous power of a woman in the Vatican”. Another contemporary said that never before had a pope allowed himself to be “so absolutely governed by a woman”. Another cardinal said that the government of Rome was “in the hands of a whore”.Roman artists, musicians, playwrights and sculptors enjoyed her patronage. She was behind the commissioning of the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, the extravagant fountain in the Piazza Navona that is today a major tourist attraction.“She was a woman of fierce passions, keen intelligence and great charm, who protected weaker women against the injustices of men. She was also greedy, calculating and at times chillingly cold,” said Herman. Soon after her death from bubonic plague in 1657, the Catholic church “moved to eradicate the scandalous memory of this audacious woman who had ruled them all”.Several years earlier, Velázquez had made his second trip to Rome, during which Donna Olimpia sat for the master. “Her character was captured in this portrait – you can see she was a pretty stern inidual,” said Macdonald.Ownership of the portrait – a companion to Velázquez’s Cardinal Camillo Massimi, which now hangs at Kingston Lacy, a National Trust house in Dorset – was meticulously documented until 1724. “Then the trace went cold,” said Macdonald.Now it is known that the painting ended up in the Netherlands, where in the 1980s it was offered at auction as the work of “anonymous, Dutch school”. It was bought by a private collector, who bequeathed it to its present owner.Sotheby’s showed the painting to Velázquez experts in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. Macdonald recalled: “Bit by bit, the jigsaw fell into place. It was incredibly exciting. Everyone who saw it was amazed that this picture, long deemed lost and thought probably to have been destroyed, had actually risen from the ashes.”The painting will be offered at a Sotheby’s sale of Old Masters in London on 3 July, alongside works by Gainsborough, Constable, Turner, Rubens, Botticelli and Brueghel, collectively estimated to be worth up to £66m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac13b87fd2f8c8bcf786b67edfc9c533da8093dc/0_63_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9500c4659de6b3bf6d0d696c6d4783da","title":"yorkshire sculpture international festival hopes to be a force for change","story":"Event arguably makes Leeds and Wakefield area best place in Europe to see sculpture“When we started here, no one thought it was a good idea,” says Peter Murray, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP), as he sits in the cafe that overlooks the rolling 202-hectare (500-acre) estate that opened to the public in 1977.Back then politicians weren’t interested, local residents and businesses didn’t understand it and the only people in favour seemed to be artists, says Murray. “In the early days there was the constant battling and fighting for funds. Then there’s the politics of the art world and the politics of regional and national government. We had to be incredibly strong willed and bloody minded.”More than 40 years later the stubbornness appears to have paid off. The YSP is at the heart of Yorkshire Sculpture International (YSI), a new festival taking place across Leeds and Wakefield. There’s a Damien Hirst statue in the middle of Briggate, the main shopping street in Leeds. Down the road there’s new work by Rashid Johnson and Cauleen Smith.Five Yorkshire-based sculptors are being supported throughout the 100-day event. The official line is that the Rhubarb Triangle has become the Sculpture Triangle with Leeds Art Gallery, the Henry Moore Institute and the award-winning the Hepworth Wakefield making this area of West Yorkshire arguably the best place in Europe to see sculpture.Murray is hopeful the event will help to further the area’s credentials as an arts mainstay. He uses the German city of Kassel as an example of a place transformed by hosting the Documenta international arts event. There was controversy in Kassel last year over Olu Oguibe’s 50ft (15-metre) obelisk, which the words “I was a stranger and you took me in” written on it in Turkish, Arabic, German, and English. The city was proposing to buy the sculpture to keep permanently, but there were protests by far-right politicians before it eventually returned to the city. In the febrile Brexit atmosphere any use of public space or money can become similarly politicised.Brian Alexander is looking up at Huma Bhabha’s Receiver, a green and black humanoid figure that stands between the city’s county hall, its police headquarters and a statute of Queen Victoria. “If you want people from Wakefield to be onside, this is an old-fashioned mining community and this doesn’t wash,” he says. “This is the civic centre of the town and I think you need something more … civic.”Alexander shows me a Facebook exchange he had the night before with a young woman who said she was happy about YSI coming to the area. He disagreed with her and thinks the average Wakefield resident would question the need for the event when the city has lost £171m of council budget cuts over eight years. “People don’t have the right idea,” he says. “They’re saying ‘why has the council spent so much money on that? The money could be spent better on something we need more’.”Funding for the festival comes in the form of a £750,000 grant from the Arts Council, which covers around half of the cost. The other half comes from partners including Wakefield council, 2023 Leeds, the University of Leeds and more than a dozen others.Godfrey Worsdale, the director of the Henry Moore Foundation, says there would be collective disappointment if fewer than a million visitors saw YSI, and he wants local residents to make up a large portion of attendees. “People in Yorkshire have got to be involved,” he says. “It needs to be internationally ambitious and locally relevant, and sculpture feels like something everyone can get around.”“It makes me think that with this place we need to redouble our efforts and fuck the notion of coming up with lowest common denominator to please lots of people. You need to keep it international to keep people’s minds and imaginations open.”Wallis’s uncompromising approach could be informed by the fact he has had to face and overcome pessimism before the Hepworth Wakefield opened in 2011. “I arrived in 2008 and the financial crash was happening and people were saying ‘no one will ever come’,” he says. “Now we have 250,000 visitors a year and a third of them are from the local area.”Wallis sees a potential positive for the arts in West Yorkshire after the current political situation calms – a move to a more devolved system. “One of the good things that could come out of this is the notion of a devolution outside of London, and that these world class and challenging experiences could be there for everyone,” he says. “You don’t have to water something down just because it’s in the regions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e96b6733074c94a053a9087dcb4ce942fa22287d/0_0_2332_1399/master/2332.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c86e43d333970ed287f21c50dc3e51c","title":"on chapel sands laura cumming extract memoir mother","story":"In an exclusive extract, the Observer’s art critic tells the remarkable story of how her mother was abducted as a child – and how it was covered upThis is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day’s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next.Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped.I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air the tide freezes the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother?I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn’t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel.All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits – until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter.How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child everything stands in open view.To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. “I used to stand on this sand-built ridge,” he wrote in old age, “and think it was the spine-bone of the world!”Veda’s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy.Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky gles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village.The beach was always Chapel’s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow’s Stores by the Pulley where in the world had they come from?All along the sea’s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father’s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother’s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood.Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George’s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out.Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man’s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea.All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother’s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda.The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages.“Betty, Chapel.” This is written in George’s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace.My mother was born on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky.But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came – and went – in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago now I must discover the truth of her story.The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty – Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard’s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston – he always signs his name in full, with some flourish – is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow’s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong.The hue and cry ran along the coast from one village to the next, from Chapel to Ingoldmells and Anderby Creek. If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty’s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes – now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift – in a house not 12 miles from the shore.My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap.The dead may be invisible, but they are not absent so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details – the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album.I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind’s eye. But the habit is also involuntary. My mother is an artist, my father was an artist it is the family profession. Every evening, after teaching at Edinburgh College of Art, my father would draw for hours in his sketchbook. These drawings took the form of lyrical abstractions of the golden mean, the cuneiform alphabet, the newly revealed wonders of the subatomic particle, occasionally a couple of highwire acrobats for his children. But recollections of the day would materialise too: a student at an easel, a bowl of spaghetti cooked by my mother, and all conceived within frames just as her doodles during a phone call would appear as finished tableaux. She might even draw the telephone itself, with its spiralling cord, add an elaborate table, then set the table with dahlias, all while hanging on for a dentist’s appointment.She taught me how to remember paintings in those long-ago days before I could take their image home from the museum in the blink of an iPhone: first draw the frame, then summarise the main shapes and volumes in rapid thumbnail. Rembrandt sketched a Titian in just the same way at an Amsterdam auction. Even the picturing of pictures is ingrained.This is almost the only way that I can think, in fact. And I have thought of this day on Chapel Sands all these years, trying to imagine who took Betty – “presumed stolen” is the police phrase – and how it could have happened, to gauge the force of it, the effect on her and on everyone involved. I picture Veda, bewildered, afraid, inexperienced, not long in charge of this child who is suddenly lost, perhaps never in charge of her again on the sands George, trying to control the situation at a distance, rushing home to take charge Betty, an inkling in blue, moving about the beach in the last of the light, and then gone. The more I have discovered, the more I realise that there was a life before the kidnap, and a life afterwards, and they were not the same for anyone.• The above is extracted from On Chapel Sands: My Mother and Other Missing Persons by Laura Cumming, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 4 July (£16.99).

However, a symbolic vote against the binding pay policy would add to pressure on the company’s leaders.Aston Martin’s struggles in recent months have come despite making progress on opening a new factory in south Wales to make the DBX, the brand’s first sports utility vehicle in its 106-year history.Palmer is hoping the car, which will retail from £140,000-£160,000, will become Aston Martin’s most popular model, helping to double production.The company has also confirmed its Valhalla supercar will feature in the 25th James Bond film, scheduled for April 2020. Aston Martin counts product placement in the series as a key part of its marketing.Aston Martin’s valuation has fallen by almost half since October, when the shares were listed, to £2.3bn. The company disappointed in its first full quarter as a listed company, as higher costs from sales and marketing dragged on profits.Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential adviser to investors on governance issues, has recommended that shareholders vote against the company’s first public remuneration policy because of the “quantum” – the size – of Palmer’s potential earnings.In a report for clients, ISS said: “There are significant concerns regarding CEO Andy Palmer’s salary of £1.2m, which is well above UK market norms for a company of this size and appears to be pitched above similar positions at comparable companies.”ISS also balked at Palmer’s “extremely competitive” potential bonus and share awards, worth as much as £6m annually if certain targets are met.In a response to ISS, Aston Martin said it was “unique” and that Palmer was “one of the leading and most experienced executives in the global automotive industry”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f284dd34954df9ee1fed9b8770aa9a2387bbc322/4_14_2593_1556/master/2593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdf476858c1742fbc6dac42a7c58dac5","title":"global markets braced for turmoil as us prepares iran sanctions","story":"Donald Trump to meet China president at G20, raising hopes of trade war breakthrough Financial markets around the world are braced for a renewed period of turbulence this week as the US readies fresh sanctions against Iran and amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war.Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that “major” additional sanctions were being prepared to use against Iran from Monday to block Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.Washington’s relations with Tehran have worsened after Trump aborted a military strike following the downing of a US spy drone last week, with the response threatening to open up another front in the geopolitical disputes holding back the world economy.John Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, said on Sunday that a fresh round of sanctions against Iran would serve as a warning not to “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.Analysts warned that renewed tensions in the Middle East would probably cause the price of oil to rise sharply on international markets and shares to tumble on stock exchanges around the world. However, the threat of sanctions rather than a full-scale military intervention could comfort concerned investors.The renewed tensions come as China’s president, Xi Jinping, and Trump prepare to meet this week in an attempt to break the deadlock in the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing.Chinese state media reported over the weekend the first official confirmation of Xi’s attendance at the G20 gathering of world leaders in Osaka, Japan, where he is expected to meet with the US president.Set against a backdrop of simmering hostility over trade between the two countries, the meeting could provide a potential breakthrough in the dispute that has harmed the resilience of the global economy over the past year.Stock markets around the world have rallied in recent weeks on the back of increased optimism of a deal between Washington and Beijing, while any reversal of the progress towards a resolution could send stocks into a tailspin.Trump and Xi met at the last G20 summit in Argentina in December, reaching a breakthrough at that time before progress was reversed earlier this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7602c4920a580a6c410b22a2716e1c10b1a7a118/0_330_5143_3085/master/5143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a444b63c51787f65762145690268288","title":"sainsburys salmon skin crisps to kombucha edgy new range","story":"The supermarket will trial ‘disrupter’ food and drink products, aimed at millennialsCrisps made from discarded salmon skin and a vegan “meal in a bottle” will be on sale at Sainsbury’s from Monday as part of a drive to test shoppers’ reactions to fledgling “disrupter” food and drink brands.Aimed at millennials, the range will be prominently displayed in dedicated bays for just 14 weeks, with shoppers asked to tell the grocery chain what it should keep to stay ahead of fast-evolving food and drink trends.Shelf banners and labels read: “If you love it, we’ll keep it.” Only those that sell well will secure longer-term, permanent listings. The so-called Taste of the Future scheme is the next phase of Sainsbury’s Future Brands initiative, set up in April 2018 to find distinctive products and support their growth through a “hot-housing” programme offering brands mentoring and other help.Edible roasted crickets launched by Sainsbury’s last November – in a UK supermarket first – were introduced under this model and are selling strongly as an alternative, sustainable food source.The new range is made up of 30 products – created by 11 startup brands – and also includes the UK’s first alcoholic kombucha (a fermented drink made from sweetened tea), seaweed-infused rapeseed oil and a pocket-sized elderflower spritzer.They will go on sale in 69 larger Sainsbury’s stores from Monday.As it seeks to gain an edge over its big four rivals, Sainsbury’s research shows younger shoppers are keen to try out edgy products in emerging categories and trends – including plant-based and alcohol-free – that also have eco-credentials. They increasingly value and seek out products with a hand-crafted nature rather than commoditised, bland foods, it found.Rachel Eyre, head of Future Brands, said: “In the first year (of Future Brands), we have found and introduced some amazing products from up-and-coming challenger brands across food, drink, household and personal care, and our customers loved them. We are very excited by this next wave of innovation.”With kombucha now one of the fastest growing drinks categories in the UK, one of the first products to be trialled will be Bootleg Booch, a lower sugar organic, alcoholic kombucha hailed for its “bold botanic flavours and crisp fresh finish”.Also in the first wave are flavoured Sea Chips – handcrafted crisps made from salmon skin that would otherwise go to waste.

That moment caught the imagination of the journalist Bill McKibben, who has written and campaigned on climate breakdown ever since. And it has been reported that fossil fuel companies, such as ExxonMobil, were making links between the burning of oil and rising sea levels as early as the 1970s. But instead of making their findings public, the industry colluded to cast doubt over the science.

For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene.His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli – who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe – is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory.In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with “bringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,” and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear.As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear – like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home – and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar.The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes – in knitwear and seersucker suiting – and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin’s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that’s proven an undeterrable trend of late.There’s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli’s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks.Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to “express something easy and cool and French” with his team who “are excited about working with new languages” and, with this, he is heading in the right direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95262406ff815c5bac0a2f3439617e7a2eed0ca6/0_107_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742ffb299b64098c5a2004eb8c478177","title":"england cameroon womens world cup last 16 match report","story":"England moved into the quarter-finals of the Women’s World Cup thanks to a 3-0 victory over Cameroon in Valenciennes, with VAR again a source of controversy.Captain Steph Houghton, Ellen White and Alex Greenwood scored the goals for Phil Neville’s side, who will face Norway on Thursday for a place in the last four.

As if Paul Pogba issuing a come-and-get-me plea so unsubtle he might as well have jumped out of a cake in the shape of the Bernabéu was not distracting enough, now there are claims that Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman is having trouble with an unruly director pushing for Steve Walsh to fill the director of football role at Old Trafford.You can understand Woodward’s reservations. On the one hand Walsh is the man credited with bringing N’Golo Kanté and Riyad Mahrez to Leicester City. On the other he took the blame for a splurge that resulted in Everton starting the 2017-18 season with 473 creative midfielders and ending it with supporters urging Sam Allardyce to eff off, which is something Walsh might want to gloss over at his next job interview.Back to that insubordinate director, though. Just who is “Sir Alex Ferguson” anyway? And how many commercial deals has he got over the line? The internet offers few clues, though it does suggest this Ferguson character held some kind of important role in United’s football department for quite a long time, only for it to all end in tears when he provided David Moyes with a glowing reference. Honestly. To think they made him a knight of the realm.Best to leave it to Ed the Red, then. Until United do appoint a director of football, that is. Only, weren’t they supposed to have had one in place by now? In fact they were talking about recruiting one for the first time in their history as long ago as last summer, back when José Mourinho was delivering sales pitches like Don Draper, albeit a heavily concussed Don Draper, as he merrily explained why nobody should attend his side’s pre-season friendlies.The thinking was that United needed a smoother recruitment policy and the topic was revisited after Mourinho’s firing in December. Paul Mitchell, previously at Southampton and Tottenham, was mentioned. There were links with Rio Ferdinand the pundit despite zero evidence the former United defender is suited to a demanding, highly specialised job. Darren Fletcher’s name was also thrown into the mix.Yet the search has dragged on and United, wounded after their failure to qualify for the Champions League, are likely to remain reliant on Woodward to negotiate transfers before a season when Everton, Leicester, Watford, West Ham and Wolves will aim to overtake them.It does not have to be this way. At a club short on expertise, however, perhaps it is unsurprising that consistency remains out of reach. Listen to Louis van Gaal explain what a technical director has to do, after all, and you could be forgiven for thinking that implementing a proper system seems like a lot of hard work. “You need knowledge of the game, methods of training, preparation experience, youth education, scouting and you have to think in structures,” the former United manager told the  last month.Van Gaal added that he was never asked about football when he was interviewed for the United job in 2014 and in that context it is possible to see how a club can lurch from a possession-based manager like the Dutchman to a pragmatist like Mourinho, before getting all misty-eyed and appointing Ole Gunnar Solskjær.United do not have to look far to see how clubs benefit when a manager does not have to worry about dysfunction off the pitch. For all their billions City would surely not have attracted Pep Guardiola if they had not put Txiki Begiristain in charge of recruitment first, while Liverpool are a shining example of how to spend wisely and originally. It is unlikely they would have won a sixth European Cup without the inspirational Jürgen Klopp, but there was a reason the German chose to come to Anfield. Klopp is not stupid. Managers of his calibre want a club with a plan.The same applies to players who value career progression above money. Once United were the biggest draw in English football, capable of doing as they pleased. Potential signings need more convincing at the moment.Perhaps Daniel James will turn out to be as canny a signing as Andy Robertson has been for Liverpool. Maybe the former Swansea winger will have Lionel Messi in a headlock in a couple of years. James is untested, though, and remains United’s only signing. By contrast Real Madrid have already spent close to £300m on six players and may yet push for Pogba.United display none of that oomph. They are linked with a new player every day, but they have yet to come up with a suitable offer for Crystal Palace’s Aaron Wan-Bissaka. They have wanted a centre-back for a year, but only now have they developed an interest in West Ham’s Issa Diop. You may recall, by the way, Mourinho’s comment when West Ham beat United last September – “Congratulations to the scout who found Diop.”Anyone fluent in José-speak will understand he was really insulting United’s talent-spotters. Diop, signed from Toulouse for £22m last summer, was hardly an unknown. Now, after one season in England, there is talk of United being willing to pay £60m for him. The only problem is West Ham have no intention of selling the Frenchman and, at this rate, it is not hard to imagine United starting next season with Chris Smalling and Phil Jones in central defence.It is a messy situation. Supporters console themselves with the knowledge that Ole is at the wheel. Look closer, though. Unfortunately Solskjær is sitting in one of those stationary kiddie-ride cars found outside supermarkets. It bounces around for a bit. It is exciting for a few seconds. Then it stops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9efc028a4e43efb66afb53755dc879488377a4/189_0_2811_1687/master/2811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c44cdd09aa577777d6f40f699de571","title":"england v cameroon womens world cup last 16 live","story":"Steph Houghton, Ellen White and Alex Greenwood scored for England in their last-16 match against a spirited Cameroon sideReport: England beat Cameroon to reach quarter-finals amid VAR dramaNeville: “It didn’t feel like football. It was a good win, we played OK. “That wasn’t football in terms of the behaviour. This is going out worldwide! I didn’t enjoy it, my players didn’t enjoy it.”“There are young girls out there seeing that behaviour and it’s not right.”How much sympathy did you have for them? “None!”“I think the referee took pity on them as we should have had a penalty and them a player sent off.”“I am proud of my players for having discipline and going out and playing football.”Scathing from Phil.Here is the report ...Well, well, well. What a fun encounter in Valenciennes. England never really got going in this match but have come out of it with a really simple win but that is not the story. VAR has taken centre stage once again and the reaction of the Cameroon players to the second goal will be remembered for a long time to come. 90+8 mins: Takounda with a horrible stamp on Houghton who lands on the Cameroon coach in the technical area. It was a needless challenge at this stage of the game. Onguene is right in the referee’s face again. Not a great day for Cameroon this. We are going to VAR for the challenge as it was a red card. The referee gives Takounda a yellow, despite it looking like a red to me. Let’s just get this done with.90+4 mins: Good news everyone! I was right in my preamble:90+2 mins: Sue Smith gives Steph Houghton player of the match, which is fair enough. She took her goal well and has ensured Cameroon have caused few problems at the back.Andy Bradshaw on VAR: “In regards to VAR, the main issue is the fact no one knows the decision process. In cricket they went through this process and it’s taken nearly 10years to get it to a point where the third umpire is heard by everyone and you can see what they’re looking at and can usually work out how they’ve reached the decision. This is sometimes ruined by the waste of carbon operating the tech, but it’s usually fine and works pretty seamlessly.”89 mins: Cameroon are still battling here to get a goal but just can’t find that clinical pass in the final third. A cross bounces off Greenwood for a corner.87 mins: Not a classic end to the game here. 85 mins: Onguene shows a flash of brilliance to go round an England midfielder but she can’t find the final pass and England crowd her out.Tony Reekie on VAR: “In the old days of one or two months ago the referee and assistants would have made those decisions right or wrong as they were borderline and the game would have carried on. Some of the VAR decisions in this match have been dodgy and it has utterly killed the game. Progress eh?”83 mins: Taylor almost gets a goal with a little dink beyond the onrushing goalkeeper but Johnson chases it down and clears it off the line for a corner. 81 mins: Parris finds space out wide and sends in a low cross for the waiting Taylor but the goalkeeper reads it claims the ball.Michael Konopka joins the debate: “A lot of the VAR decisions that people seem to have issues with seem to be the result of interpreting slow motion video of the event. It leads to decisions being made based on millimeters or makes tackles appear more violent or egregious than they do in real speed. Require that reviews must be made at full speed and if it can’t be determined from that, go with call on the field.”79 mins: Chris McVandi sums up our opinions: “VAR is Very Annoying Replay.”77 mins: Kirby and Parris combine, before the former lays it onto Taylor in space but her shot is pretty atrocious and goes well wide. Kirby was possibly fouled in the area and we’re going to VAR. Looks like it’s going to be a penalty ... Kirby got caught on her foot after the ball had gone. The referee takes her time and gives a goal kick. I have no idea anymore. Maybe it was a diplomatic decision.74 mins: All very bitty now. Not a great spectacle.72 mins: All quiet in Valenciennes at the moment.Joachem Blad on VAR: “I cannot understand everyone complaining about VAR! If VAR wasn’t there today, a completely fine England goal would have been disallowed and a marginally offside Cameroon goal would have stood, influencing the game hugely. The game is a lot more fair with VAR than it was without, a fact somehow quite often overlooked...”VAR is good for my inbox, that’s for sure.70 mins: A pretty tame cross is sent into the box where Ngo Ndom comes to claim under no pressure but drops the ball, allowing Taylor to take possession. England fail to make the most of it and the ball is scrambled away. 68 mins: Bronze goes on a run through the middle but is met on the edge of the area by Onguene who ensures she goes no further with a crunching tackle. Down the other end an offside Abam races onto a pass, goes clean through but her low drive is saved by Bardsley. It does not matter anyway as the flag is put up in the end. 66 mins: Scott sends Kirby away down the right but the Chelsea player’s cross is a poor one, allowing Cameroon to cut it out.Ian Plenderleith states: “The VAR was consulted or intervened four times in the first half during Germany-Nigeria yesterday. I was in the stadium, and it got to the point where the large parts of the crowd started booing every time the ref put her finger to her ear. Resistance from the masses! Despite Fifa‘s reffing coordinator Pierluigi Collina claiming it‘s been a success, the view from anyone not working for Fifa is that VAR needs a serious re-think, at the very least.”64 mins: A Cameroon corner is lifted into the box where Takounda attempts an overhead kick but she completely misses her shot and England clear the danger. Taylor comes on for White, meaning England now have 1 to 11 on the pitch, which is an exciting prospect.Tor Turner emails: “To add to your overflowing mails on the subject, I’d like to suggest that for marginal VAR calls like that one, they should introduce something similar to how “Umpire’s Call” works in cricket reviews.“Distance \u0026lt a certain value offside (6 inches maybe) should be down to the ref on the grounds that the differential is so marginal, unless there’s an obvious advantage in play by being just offside (like evading an offside trap manoeuvre by defenders), the original decision stands.Would allow for more nuance in the face of scenarios like that one.England looking rocky here. Against Norway I’m not feeling our chances. And that’s assuming we don’t do a ScotlandEngland men’s cricket team and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”62 mins: Kirby clips the ball through to White in the area, the striker spins and lifts the ball over the goalkeeper but it loops beyond the bar. 60 mins: Nchout gets the ball in the box, works it onto her left foot but she does not hit her shot cleanly and it squirms to Greenwood on the edge of her own six-yard box and she whacks it clear. Duggan tries to wriggle through a couple of defenders but the ball ends up going behind for a corner. Duggan sends in a low cross to Greenwood who runs onto it and smashes it into the net. What a well-worked corner. Game over here.55 mins: A long ball is sent over the top for Takounda to chase, Bardsley hesitates and the ball is lofted over her but Greenwood recovers and clears before a belated offside flag is raised. 53 mins: There are boos from the crowd. I am not exactly sure who they are from, though. This is all getting a bit tetchy. Takounda, seconds after coming on, latches onto an atrocious backpass from Greenwood but Bardsley stays big and blocks the shot. What a chance that was!Mark emails in: “Can we please stop using VAR for offside, UNLESS it’s to correct an obvious error? If a player is so marginally offside the referee andlinespersoncan’t spot it, it is giving the player no strategic advantage. It’s simply spoiling the game and it isn’t what the off side rule was designed to do. Now officials are under pressure to spot everything as all their decisions are so publicly exposed. I strongly suspect without VAR England’s goal would not have been flagged, and can one really believe Cameroon wouldn’t have scored if the player had been half a foot further back?”51 mins: The offside in the England goal was not tight, this one was incredibly narrow even if it was the right call, which is adding to anger. Nchout is crying on the pitch. The players are rightly emotional but the referee has to take control of the situation here.49 mins: NO GOAL! Cameroon take advantage of a poor kick from Bardlsey, sending in a cross for Nchout to fire beyond the England goalkeeper. It goes to VAR for an offside in the buildup to the goal ... and it’s ruled out! This will not please Cameroon, especially as she was offside by a millimetre. It’s all kicking off on the sideline.47 mins:  A quiet start to the second half, which is a relief to all concerned.Here we go again!Adrien Dunnion says: “Also, Kuwait refused to play after Giresse scored against them in 1982, then France refused to play when the ref overturned the decision.”Good news! Cameroon are back out on the pitch. Hopefully they’ll be kind enough to play the second half.We have more on France circa 1982 ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f78f0474c278fe6551d83bdb21831d36aa5ef61/814_722_2694_1617/master/2694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac75d6559d93c8bb4cbe73eb813f00bc","title":"carine roitfeld rules for chic french vogue","story":"Carine Roitfeld, queen of French fashion, reveals her rules for Parisienne chic to a ‘terrified’ Sophie HeawoodCarine Roitfeld was the editor of French Vogue for 10 years, worked closely with Karl Lagerfeld, is an adviser to Tom Ford – and is an absolute titan in the global fashion world. Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn’t remotely surprised I’m terrified.“People think I’m judging, but I’m not judging,” she says. “I’m watching. It’s different. People sometimes say, ‘My God her eyes will scan you,’ but it’s not to judge you. It’s to get ideas. It’s observation.”Well that’s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models’ mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. “Would Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?” asked the American website Jezebel at the time.I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. “I do not like this,” she says. “I like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.”It does seem to be true – she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about £50 from a small animal-friendly brand she’s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams “because you put too much stuff in it,” she says, as if she’s my mum.After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I’d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian – except it hasn’t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it’s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets – can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn’t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself – by not tying it at all.“Never a knot,” she says. “But I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.” She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it’s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand.I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn’t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can’t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods – I have hit the nail on the head.“To be beautiful costs so much money,” she agrees. “For something you don’t see.” She favours the aesthetician Hervé Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. “I don’t want to name names but there are some who can’t move their faces any more. Like Cher.” Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style “because we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.”But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. “Chic,” replies Carine Roitfeld, “is innate.”In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, “Yes, like him, your future queen,” she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don’t about Prince William’s son.George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there’s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is “a very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he’s very proud of himself”. So he’s the one you shouldn’t marry, I suggest. “Oh maybe you should,” she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity.Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. “If he say I can do it, I can do it.” She says the French aren’t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, “because they didn’t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn’t care.”Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school’s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too.“When I’m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I’m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, ‘I think it’s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it’s you, do it. You open minds.’” At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision – she genuinely thought she might get murdered. “And they do kill me, but it’s OK.”Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you’re still here. You mean you were… criticised?“Yes, but a lot. It’s different in different countries. When you’re doing something new, it’s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it’s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I’m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now – you’re not going to put them away from fashion, they’re too big now.”I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It’s been a huge shift. “Yes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It’s part of the world today.”On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night “so you’ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,” and that she doesn’t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, “because I’m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.” Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, “espresso and cigarettes”, and she doesn’t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it’s vulgar? “Because it’s dangerous!”As for her own relationship with the mirror, “I’m lucky because I’m rather blind now so I don’t see myself very well, it’s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.” She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, “but he say to me: ‘Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.’ I say: ‘Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.’ He say: ‘No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.’ I say: ‘OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.’ So I do not take selfies.”She misses Karl Lagerfeld. “I really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was… not a new father for me, but a protector.” Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand.I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. “He was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.” We meet just before French Mother’s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. “I know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother’s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother’s Day?”She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was.“I was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.” Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, “They are very polite, they’re working and they’re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.”So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy?“Oh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don’t have,” she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. “But grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.”You wouldn’t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself?“Never say never but… certainly not.”She says it’s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back.“I have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.”I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn’t feel able to admit it, or to complain. “I have some good drugs,” she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable.Even if she’s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: “A bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.” And there we have it: my new mantra.That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it’s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still.

But are ‘life extensionists’ any closer to finding the key to longevity? Alex Moshakis meets some of the people determined to become immortalIn 2016, an American real-estate investor named James Strole established the Coalition for Radical Life Extension, a nonprofit based in Arizona which aims to galvanise mainstream support for science that might one day significantly prolong human life. Standards in modern medicine are allowing us to live longer now than ever before. But that is not Strole’s concern. What good are a few more measly years? He is interested in extending life not by days and weeks, but by decades and even centuries, to the degree that mortality becomes optional – an end to The End. “The deathist paradigm has to go,” a line on the Coalition’s website reads. “It’s time to look beyond the past of dying to a future of unlimited living.” It describes its supporters as “early-adopting advocates, numbering in the thousands”.Life extensionists (or longevists, or immortalists) fit neatly into two types. The first are rationalists: scientific researchers at the coalface of gerontology, the study of ageing, chipping away at the many technical difficulties of ending entropy. Strole is the second type. A businessman, he has no formal scientific training, but is nevertheless resolutely committed to the cause, eager to rally behind new findings. He hopes to live indefinitely, or at least until 150. But he is ultimately reliant on researchers finding a way. Consider him less a gerontological groupie than a politely optimistic mega-fan, sitting on the sidelines of science, willing on a major breakthrough.He isn’t alone. Life extensionists have become a fervent and increasingly vocal bunch. Famously, the community includes venture capitalists and Silicon Valley billionaires, non-gerontologists all, and nearly all men, who consider death undesirable and appear to have made so much money they require infinite life in which to spend it. But now mere mortals are joining the throng, heads filled with fantasies of forever. Humans have lusted after immortality for as long as they have been alive. So far the quest has been unsuccessful – we still die! But good news: paradise is reported to be closer now than ever before, and private clinics and online pharmacies are promising to help get us there, “there” being the future, all of it.Strole has been an evangelist of human immortality since he was a child, when his grandmother died, and he felt “a pain you can’t even describe, it’s so deep in your gut.” He was 11, still new to the world, and he came to think of death, like most of us do at some point or another, as deeply unfair.In the early 1970s, when he was in his 20s, he began touring the US as a public speaker, sharing what was then limited gerontological research, but nevertheless extolling its possibilities and advocating the anti-ageing benefits of a positive mindset: “Isn’t life great? You can live forever if you really try!” Because Strole is not scientifically accredited, he mostly based his patter around inspirational healthy-living tips, much of which would now fall under the umbrella of common-sense wellness: exercise, eat well but not too much, look after yourself. But still his message seemed radical, and he was not always well-received. Audiences wary of Strole’s ideas condemned him for testing God’s will, or disrupting the natural order. His concepts ran counter to the common world view – that we live and then we die. Particularly aggravated spectators referred to him as “the devil”. Every now and then he received death threats.Nevertheless, he persisted. He considered himself fortunate to work in a field that meant he was privy to insider information and he became convinced a significant breakthrough was around the corner. To fully prepare his body for the rigmarole of centuries-long life, he adopted a strict health regimen. He fasted, juiced, cleansed and devoured supplements, inviting audiences to do the same. Eventually, a community formed, driven by a shared, urgent aversion to death. “We felt then how important it was to do everything you could to stay alive,” he saysStrole is now 70. He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, a desert town. In the life-extensionist mode, he avoids dairy and rarely touches bread, though he devours a whole heap of other things. Recently his diet has included pills, branded “Cognitive”, which he takes twice a day and claims have all sorts of nourishing effects on his brain. (What good is maintaining the body if not the mind?) The pills are part of a self-directed anti-ageing process that requires a lot of swallowing. On some days, Strole takes 70 supplements, including a tablet that “energises the mitochondria” (mitochondria produce energy) and whose effects resemble “a shot of coffee, minus the jitters”, as well as vitamins, multi-nutrients and metformin, a diabetes drug that has become so popular among life extensionists that one referred to it as “the aspirin of anti-ageing”. In the early mornings, when the Arizona air is still brisk, he takes a cold dip in his pool to shock his immune system into better function, and at some point or another he lies face-up on an electromagnetic mat that whirs silently against his body and “opens up the veins”, and engages in a breathing regime that, he says, “balances the hormones”.These are typical life-extension strategies, though most people supplement regimens with their own ideas. Some fast. Others arrange expensive stem cell replacement therapies. To maintain a supple mind, the gerontologist Marios Kyriazis, who is in his 60s and heads the British Longevity Society, reads the newspaper upside down, and whenever that becomes too easy, he reads the newspaper upside down and reflected in a mirror. Think of it as an alternative to Sudoko.What good is all of this? The current life-extensionist strategy is twofold. First, achieve a “wellness foundation,” Strole says. Second, stay alive until the coming gerontological breakthrough. All that is required is to “live long enough for the next innovation,” and presuming you do, “You can buy another 20 years.” Twenty years here, 20 years there, it all adds up, and suddenly you’re 300. This is a common view. Last year the British billionaire Jim Mellon, who has written a book on longevity, titled Juvenescence, said: “If you can stay alive for another 10 to 20 years, if you aren’t yet over 75 and if you remain in reasonable health for your age, you have an excellent chance of living to more than 110.” To most, 110 seems a modest target. Why not forever? “It’s not some big quantum leap,” Strole says, by way of explanation. He invokes the analogy of a ladder: “step by step by step” to unlimited life. In 2009 the American futurist Ray Kurzweil, another supplement enthusiast, coined a similar metaphor, referring instead to “bridges to immortality”.Where to begin with the almighty question: why would anyone think this a good idea? Strole is openly afraid of death (who isn’t? He argues), though he seems more motivated by a kind of curiosity. We live our lives knowing they will one day end. Imagine what we might accomplish if they didn’t. (It is not clear exactly what Strole might actually want to accomplish: self-actualisation? World peace? That tricky jigsaw?) The American entrepreneur Dave Asprey, who is 46 but hopes to live beyond 180, and who takes 150 supplements a day, told me: “I can’t imagine running out of exciting new problems to solve!”This motivation is common – the burning desire to help – and it can be seen as morally virtuous or horribly presumptuous, depending on your opinion on the altruistic potential of a bunch of disproportionately wealthy, middle-aged men. (Is it possible the future will become a refuge for the rich, who experience life as a sequence of exquisite events and who might not understand the concept of entropy as relief or escape?) Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. “You can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,” Asprey says, “before you’re like, ‘I’ve got to buckle down.’” Though when I asked the British gerontologist Aubrey de Grey why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: “My hot tub.”De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field’s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, “We’re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.” No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer’s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues – of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. “The benefits of living longer are not the point,” he says. “The benefits are not having Alzheimer’s disease.” For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal.Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance – almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute of Aging, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to “dramatic increases in life”, some of them multi-fold, “There has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.” The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the Longevity Fund, a venture capital firm that supports “high-potential longevity companies”, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing – inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline – but that, in humans, “We really don’t know right now what will work and what won’t.”Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifes (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God?In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won’t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don’t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a “multifaceted problem”. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don’t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair – constant fine-tuning. What’s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up?De Grey shares Strole’s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. “I want to wait and see,” he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become “progressively more effective… so I don’t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.”This does not seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At RAADfest, the Coalition’s annual conference – “the Woodstock of radical life extension” – visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an “anti-ageing hormone”. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to “boost physical and mental energy”. Or Piracetam, from the family of “smart drugs”, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: “The marketplace of your future.” It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 – beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as “a fountain of cash”, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated – “patent pending”, in the vernacular – and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, “should not be assumed to be safe or effective” in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that “Patients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.”)A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of “anti-ageing hormones,” an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. “Despite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,” the association said, “the scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.”The oldest person to have lived, Jeanne Calment, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifes significantly over the past 160 years.Strole does that and more. So far it’s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st – “the perfect weight” – with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn’t arrive in his lifetime? “Well, then we’re in a little bit of hot water,” he says. But “it’s better to go for it than to not go for it. It’s better than just settling in. Don’t go quietly into the night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f080fef58fce974e2d19808914a9e5c0793baec/0_129_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40ffebb2d79154316d872868a09710f9","title":"five ways to improve your 5km run time","story":"Charlotte Arter, the British 10,000-metre champion and Saucony ambassador, clocked the fastest female Parkrun time in the world in Cardiff earlier this year, at just 15min 50sec. She advises varying runs by length and pace. For three to four runs a week, Arter recommends one faster 5km, broken down into intervals (for example, 10 one-minute or six two-minute bursts, with a short recovery in between) a slower, longer session and then a couple of 20- to 40-minute runs at a conversational pace.“Everyone runs differently,” says Arter – but experience helps. “The more Parkruns or 5ks you do, the better understanding you have as to what you can tolerate. Experiment – one Parkrun, try going out a bit harder and see what happens.”It is possible to be “a slave to the watch”, says Arter, but “understanding how you feel when you’re running is important. Some of the best races I’ve done, I’ve just run to feel.” The Team GB and England athletics coach Nick Anderson says he often sees people being too governed by data that may not always be relevant.Arter suggests concentrating on another runner, say 10 metres ahead, as a way to stay focused – if you catch up with them, look for someone else. If she is really struggling, she will count her steps to 100, then start over. “It just helps take my mind off it.”The Cardiff Parkrun where Arter set the world record is “dead flat”, she says. “There is no way I’d be able to run that in the Parkruns that are really hilly.” For a new challenge, try some Parkrun tourism. The statistician and runner Tim Grose has ranked the fastest and slowest Parkrun courses in the UK based on last year’s results. Victoria Dock and Hackney Marshes in London were quickest, followed by Worthing in Sussex Woolacombe Dunes in Devon, Churchfields Farm in Worcestershire and Whinlatter Forest in Cumbria were deemed the toughest.When you eat before a run is personal preference, but it is important to have something, says Arter, who typically has a bowl of porridge. Making sure you are hydrated long before the run is also key. About 20 minutes before a race, Arter likes to do a 15-minute jog, incorporating some bursts of speed, such as two 90-second hard sprints. “I like to get my heart rate and breathing up, so it’s not a shock to the system when I start.”As for where to position yourself, being at the front can mean you avoid congestion, but you risk starting too quickly, says Arter. “I think it’s just making sure you’re not too far back. If you’re going to fight through people, you’re never going to run a really quick time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e513afc42ddd647dccc6ba97589403a8eb4059/0_75_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7386f989a9983cef3af5b705281bd641","title":"how to stop biting your nails","story":"Nail-biting doesn’t necessarily begin as a result of stress or anxiety, but is often something that is observed and copied from a young age. Over time, it becomes a habit, potentially crossing the boundary into becoming a coping strategy. As a very physical act, nail-biting can provide a welcome distraction or sense of relief when you are feeling anxious or are in a heightened emotional state.The key to changing such habitual behaviours is to determine your motivation. Whether you don’t like the way your hands look with bitten nails, or you want to find a better way of dealing with your anxiety, you need to establish the negative consequences of biting your nails and why you want to stop.Then you need to search for alternative ways of coping or distracting yourself. Simple activities such as reading can help to ert your attention, or you can try occupying your hands by messaging friends or playing games on your phone. It’s essential to create your own self-soothing “toolkit”, involving little activities that help to calm you in an alternative way. For example, when you feel the urge to bite your nails, you could make yourself a cup of tea, or put on a nice hand moisturiser instead.These methods can work in tandem with products that are designed to combat nail-biting, such as bad-tasting nail varnishes. Such products work by attributing adverse consequences to the habit, helping you to suppress the addictive behaviour. However, for sustainable change, the key to kicking a habit is to be proactive. Identify what you are using the habit for and then find other activities that can replace it, creating healthier coping strategies.Dr Elena Touroni is a consultant psychologist and co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic in London.

They are the ultimate horticultural multitaskers, offering beautiful flowers on a patio outdoors in summer and glossy-leaved evergreen houseplants when brought in for the winter. Of course, there’s attractive, tasty fruit, too – and that’s before we even talk about the uplifting scent of their blossoms.However, there is always one small caveat: the vast majority of citrus plants I see in garden centres are oranges, lemons and the occasional clementine or mandarin – the same fruit that are incredibly easy and cheap to buy in the shops. This is a shame considering that the cost of the plants easily outweighs any harvest you’d ever get. If only we picked some of the rarer varieties (there are at least 100), we could get some wonderfully unusually flavoured fruit that is essentially unbuyable in the shops – all for the same price and level of care as one of their more common cousins. So if you are toying with the idea of giving citrus a go, here are my top three unusual plants for great flavour.For those only familiar with the Persian lime, Citrus x latifolia, which dominates supermarket shelves, Key limes (Citrus x aurantiifolia) will be nothing short of a culinary revelation. With its thinner, more highly aromatic rind, paired with bracingly sharp juice that comes with an explosion of zesty, almost floral fragrance, there is just no comparison. It is this lime that gives really authentic Latin American food its refreshing notes and, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the essential ingredient for Florida Key lime pie. Key lime pie made without Key limes is simply not worthy of the name.On the subject of limes, if you only have space for one citrus I would go for the kaffir lime, Citrus hystrix. While it produces tasty fruit whose zest is a staple of many southeast Asian dishes, it offers a second and much more generous harvest of tasty leaves, too. Used just like you do bay leaves, but with the brightest, fresh lime flavour, a single plant will provide more than you can eat all year round. Considering how eye-wateringly expensive these are to buy in the shops, how hard they are to find and how quickly they lose their flavour once harvested, when it comes to bang for your buck, there is no contest.Finally, I implore you to give the super-trendy Japanese ingredient, yuzu (Citrus x junos) a go. The round, yellow fruit look like oversized mandarins, betraying part of their ancestry. With all the fruity fragrance of the former, combined with the wild vigour of their other ancestor, the Ichang lemon of China, they are probably the hardiest fruiting citrus that can be grown in the UK.

But how useful are they really? And don’t they just make us feel even more stressed?Visiting a maternity ward last week I saw the oddest thing. A series of posters designed to promote breastfeeding, each one a disembodied white woman’s torso. The first featured her tits being groped by a variety of hands. “Bond with your baby,” said a slogan over the tit pictured stage left, a child’s hand covering the nipple. And above the second tit, this one enclosed by a pink male hand, the words, “Bond with your man.” OK. The next poster showed the tits in a leopard-print bra, a baby sucking on one nipple, and the slogan, “Designer mum. Designer milk.” An involuntary shudder. Not just at the suggestion that the reason so many women bottle-feed their babies is to protect their “designer” bosom, but at the memory of drowning in similarly delirious mothering advice, in finding myself bleeding on a battleground, its lines drawn in crayon.Parenting advice is big business, despite appearing to consist of just two contrasting ideas: the first, control the kid the second, control yourself. The many millions of books written, about feeding, sleeping, carrying, playing, inevitably extend into a variety of things to buy, whether tech-driven sleep aids or parenting coaches, or “mumpreneur” networking events. And yet, despite so many parents’ shaky investments (at a time when their earnings must be impacted) much of the advice is offered without much, if any, serious explanation why.On maternity leave I remember standing in the supermarket hovering over a box of formula, having slept for no more than two hours at a time for months and, as if trying to remember a dream, searching the empty pocket of my brain for the reasons why it had felt important to breastfeed. Something about immunity? Bonding? I really wanted to buy the formula, but the books said no, and I didn’t dare get it wrong. So on I fed, my designer tits relegated to TK Maxx, my exhaustion a feral cat that hid in corners and screamed at cars.At times that abstracted advice must have been a relief – a calm voice telling you what to do and when. But from this distance I’m scandalised. “By not explaining why,” writes Emily Oster in her new bestseller, Cribsheet, “we remove people’s ability to think about these choices for themselves, with their own preferences playing a role.” Oster is an economist, and Cribsheet is a chatty but extensive analysis of what research reveals about the benefits and drawbacks of co-sleeping, breastfeeding, toilet training, circumcision and other fraught conversations that typically take place at 3am. Its interrogations are sensible and sane, but its final advice is the most radical: rather than worrying about parenting mistakes, just… try not to think about it.It’s the antithesis of the intensive mothering so many parenting books advise. A level of concentration, both on the child and on educating oneself about how to bring up that child that, despite existing in order to relieve stress, becomes its own new anxiety. In 2017 researchers looked at how the use of parenting books affected 354 mothers – the more books they read, the study found, “The more likely they were to have symptoms of depression, low self-efficacy and not feel confident as a parent.” With the completion of one book a new level is unlocked, one that can only be won by reading more books, downloading more apps. The next level after sorting a baby’s sleep patterns, of course, being to sort workplace structures, government sexism and societal inequality.It is rare, though, for a parenting book to admit, as Oster’s does, that even with all the knowledge and all the apps, there is rarely one “correct” choice. Not just because the data is limited, or the parent (like the customer they quickly become) is always right. But because it happens backwards – it’s after making the choice, whether to breastfeed or to close the door on a screaming baby, that we decide it was the right one, and so prescribe it to others. “If I choose not to breastfeed, I don’t want to acknowledge that there are even small possible benefits to breastfeeding,” she explains. “So I encamp myself in the position that breastfeeding is a waste of time. On the other side, if I spend two years taking my boobs out every three hours, I need to believe that this is what it takes to deliver a life of continued successes to my child.” The avoidance of cognitive dissonance: it does more for self-help than any mindfulness technique.The decent books are honest about the limits of socioeconomic data, gentle about the tensions, and explicitly acknowledge the role of luck. But too often parenting advice is simply “content” – that self-reproducing machine that expands to fit all broken spaces, all internet cracks. Staring at those posters in the maternity ward last week, the flimsy advice felt more like craven exploitation of new parents, desperate to try to fix a system they are powerless to even touch.Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer or follow her on Twitter @EvaWiseman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f755c7ad8f80383438b0e41d8b56d69dc8b33272/0_412_2533_1519/master/2533.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ffe02afc87e16af38e09b3d8b6159b","title":"leaves become intricate crochet art in pictures","story":"Artist Susanna Bauer describes the delicate leaf and crochet sculptures she’s been making for the past 10 years as “a tribute to nature”.

How do stories happen? How do you know a story is a story? And, inevitably, do you make stories up?Given that there is no single, straightforward answer to any of them, especially that contentious last one, I came across an interesting case last week that helps to cast some light on the process – perhaps I should say, mystery – of story-getting.A Belfast-based BBC reporter, Chris Lindsay, was casually reading a guidebook on a Singapore Airlines flight when he came across an item about the murals in the city where he works. These political wall paintings, reputed to number 300, have earned themselves a Wikipedia entry which describes them as symbols of Northern Ireland and points to the thematic differences between those in republican areas and in loyalist areas.But Lindsay thought the airline guide writer went much further by overstating those differences in rather colourful language. He or she contended that loyalist murals “resemble war comics without the humour” while the republican ones “often aspire to the heights of Sistine Chapel-lite”.The guide said: “Recently, Protestant murals have taken on a grimmer air and typical subjects include wall-eyed paramilitaries perpetually standing firm against increasing liberalism, nationalism and all the other -isms Protestants see eroding their stern, bible-driven way of life.”By contrast, murals in nationalist areas featured “themes of freedom from oppression, and a rising nationalist confidence that romantically and surreally mix and match images from the Book of Kells, the Celtic mist mock-heroic posters of the Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick, assorted phoenixes rising from the ashes and revolutionaries clad in splendidly idiosyncratic sombreros and bandanas from ideological battlegrounds in Mexico and South America”.So, once he landed, Lindsay called a couple of “experts” to ask what they thought of the comments. Was the differentiation fair?First up was Professor Peter Shirlow, head of Irish studies at the University of Liverpool. He was unequivocal in his assessment, telling Lindsay: “I found some of the commentary to be offensive, if not sectarian. It plays upon sectarian myths of identity and culture in Northern Ireland.” It was unbalanced and unfair.Next, Lindsay turned to the author Fionnuala O Connor. She told him the comments had a “republican triumphalist ring” while being “patronising and sneering at loyalists”.Lindsay discovered that the ultimate publisher of the remarks was Fodor’s, the US-based travel guide company. He told them what Shirlow and O Connor had said, and was astounded when, within hours, Fodor’s announced that the section on the murals had been taken down from its website and would also be removed from the next print edition of Fodor’s Essential Ireland.As far as Lindsay and his BBC editors were concerned they had a story, which duly appeared on the corporation’s news website: “Fodor’s Travel removes ‘offensive’ Belfast murals guide.” The article quickly generated a wider media reaction. The Belfast  carried a news story in which a loyalist spokesman was quoted as condemning the guide’s comments as sectarian.Then, just as night follows day, the commentators arrived on the scene. Malachi O’Doherty weighed in with a Belfast  piece decrying the guide writer’s comments on the basis that “they repeat an old trope that Protestants are dull-witted, while Catholics are vibrant and imaginative”.In the Irish News, the largest-selling daily serving Northern Ireland, Brian Feeney registered disbelief that this amounted to a story of any consequence because it was blindingly obvious that murals across the religiouspolitical ide are different in tone and content. He was waspish about the story’s genesis, referring to the “predictable” outrage from loyalists “partly engineered by local BBC”. As far as he was concerned, “the people who complained about Fodor’s accurate description of grim loyalist murals with ‘wall-eyed paramilitaries’ are in denial about the state of their own communities.”Then Newton Emerson, a unionist commentator who has a weekly column in the Dublin-based , took the opportunity to denounce the muralists from both communities, arguing that it was time for all the paintings to be erased on the grounds that they lack artistic merit. Maybe, but that’s somewhat beside the point. The substantive issue is that the story, because of Fodor’s extraordinary decision to respond so surprisingly and dramatically to the BBC’s call from Lindsay, had taken off. So why did Fodor’s indulge in what amounts to self-censorship?Its editorial director, Douglas Stallings, responded to my inquiry with a mixture of doublespeak, corporate defensiveness and one important fact, namely that “the description of the murals has appeared in the print edition of Fodor’s Essential Ireland through several editions with no complaints”.Here’s the doublespeak. “We did not receive a direct complaint from the person who was offended by our description of the murals … The concerns about the material in question were brought to our attention … via an inquiry from Chris Lindsay.” So, an international publisher decided to delete an item from a guide book because of a single call from reporter who cited “concerns” canvassed from two critics.And now for the corporate self-justification: “Fodor’s Travel always asks our writers and editors to be aware of potential political and cultural bias in our coverage of any destination. We will ask our writer to review and, if necessary, rewrite the murals feature, and plan to restore coverage of the murals next year when we publish a new edition of Fodor’s Essential Ireland.”When it comes to doublespeak, however, the response to my queries about the matter by BBC Ulster takes some beating. The opening sentence of its statement was a masterly piece of sophistry: “When the Fodor’s description of Belfast’s murals was brought to our attention, we asked experts and commentators if they believed it was accurate.”Brought to our attention? It was a BBC reporter who generated that attention. Experts and commentators plural? It was one academic and one commentator.The spokesperson, in an attempt to suggest an even-handedness that was entirely missing from its online article, added: “We also discussed the topic on some of our radio programmes where a broad range of opinion was sought, including those who believe the Fodor’s account is fair and accurate.”As has been said of journalism so often, there is a world of difference between “a story” and the truth.To say there is no difference between the murals in each community is simply to deny reality. Between them, the BBC and Fodor’s have fomented a storm without any merit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add74ac58f879d54fac9f4226260c8100f765328/130_643_2653_1592/master/2653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be9cdf25dceb7bf46f70a65e51c51c33","title":"glastonbury organiser emily eavis says some men  refuse to deal with her","story":"Emily Eavis says there are male execs in music industry who insist on speaking to her fatherThe Glastonbury festival organiser, Emily Eavis, has said some men in the music industry still refuse to deal with her despite her taking over responsibility from her father for overseeing the lineup.Speaking days before the start of this year’s event, Eavis, 40, who has been booking acts at Glastonbury for half her life, said she was often the only woman in meetings with music moguls.Some male executives still insisted on speaking to her father, Michael Eavis, 83, who co-created the festival at the family’s Worthy Farm in Somerset, she said.“The live music world has been so male-dominated,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs. “I go to meetings with just tables of men. Some were great, and some just refuse to accept that they had to deal with me.”“We are working toward 5050. Some years it’s 6040. It’s a challenge for us and we’ve really taken it on and I’m always totally conscious everyday that the gender balance should be right.”She added: “Every day when I’m booking I’m thinking about that and cajoling stage bookers to be onboard with it. Some of them have been here a long time so it’s a little bit of hustle. But we’re getting there.”Kyle Minogue, Miley Cyrus and Janet Jackson are among the big acts this year, alongside the Killers, the Cure and Stormzy. Eavis has complained about sexism in the industry since she first started booking acts at one of the world’s largest music festivals.Speaking to the Observer in 2009, she said: “People didn’t take it seriously coming from a girl, especially as not only was I a girl, but a ‘daughter of’ … but my dad has in no way given this to me in a nicely wrapped package. He has challenged me, made sure I can do it.”Eavis also told Desert Island Discs her family were often the brunt of local anger at the festival when she was a child in the 1980s. “We used to have people shouting at us when we drove through the village. At the time it felt like we were part of something really controversial and everyone had an opinion, and they used to just let us know. You’d be at a Christmas drinks party and someone would just come over and start shouting.”Eavis said she was not a fan of the festival as a child, and was troubled by the arrival of so many strangers on her family’s land.She said the event could be “pretty scary at times” during the early days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7cbc322e69ff8cec432f07be506e97e6203188e/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c45a3b27dbed40801d463be50ca469a","title":"green music festivals eco environment","story":"When Chris Johnson first started putting on outdoor parties with his mates, they were small, impromptu and shambolic – or “really good fun”, as he puts it. Seventeen years later and he and the same four university friends are still pioneering in their field of partying, albeit Shambala is now a four-day festival in rural Northamptonshire with 15,000 people that has set an industry standard for its eco-credentials.“We’re a purpose-led organisation, the point of it existing is to contribute something to the world,” says Johnson, “and the environment is an important part of our outlook we have a responsibility – but also an opportunity to experiment.”If the cultural conversation around festivals in recent years has focused on shaming organisers into booking more female musicians for their lineups or making them less white, the buzz this summer is on sustainability: how can festivals go green?For one, the war on plastic seems to have proliferated: this year, Glastonbury has banned the sale of single-use plastic drink bottles across the site. Co-organiser Emily Eavis estimates “the ban will save the million bottles that we would have otherwise sold” and is in line with the festival’s ethos to tread lightly on the land. Instead, the 200,000-strong audience will be served by 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks, using Worthy Farm’s purpose-built water reservoirs.Earlier this year more than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, pledged to go plastic-free by 2021. Straws, cutlery and bottles remain major offenders and bans have been met with enthusiasm by audiences. But according to Claire O’Neill, co-founder of the not-for-profit organisation A Greener Festival, which audits and advises the industry on how to reduce its environmental impact, the key challenges remain “transport, tents and toilets”.Getting festival-goers to the site using public transport or signing up to car-share schemes makes the biggest difference to the carbon footprint. Trying to make sure they pack up and take their tents is also a major environmental headache.“We actively ask people to consider what they bring to the festival and urge them not to bring disposable tents,” says Ian Fielder, operations director at Green Man festival. “We don’t ban it because we don’t want to become financially prohibitive, but they are a bane for most festivals. The waste is extraordinary.”Green Man works with refugee charities to repurpose left-behind tents, but emphasises that many of them are impossible to recycle and get sent to incinerators.At Houghton, an electronic music festival set in a Norfolk estate, sewage is treated equally seriously. “We’re using compostable toilets across the site this year,” says co-founder Tom Elkington, who explains at length the environmental benefits over chemical portable toilets. “Being sustainable and ethical is a core social responsibility for us – a lot of what we do isn’t legislation, but it probably should be.”For Festival Republic boss Melvin Benn, who runs major events including Latitude and Wireless, efficient use of the diesel-powered generators used on sites remains a key focal point. For Benn, converting to vegetable waste oil, biofuel and hybrid units makes environmental and economic sense.At BlueDot, a science and music festival held at Jodrell Bank observatory in Manchester, the line-up is heavy with climate crisis panels and talks from experts and activists. According to the festival director, Ben Robinson, the emphasis isn’t just on what happens at the festival but what the audience takes from it afterwards.“Of course, building mini-cities in fields every summer has an environmental impact,” he says. “But festivals can prompt long-term behavioural change. It’s not just about hedonism. People are open to new ideas and it invites them into a different conversation. We cause a conscious cultural shift – using less plastic, reducing waste, living sustainably. If these can be achieved on site, they can make a difference long after people have gone home.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development.

With his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, taking second, the team ensured both another one-two finish and their eighth consecutive win this season. Ferrari were effectively in a different race. Charles Leclerc managed third in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen with Sebastian Vettel in fifth, having started from seventh on the grid.Hamilton led from pole with a consummate if not entirely thrilling display of control from the very front.He finished a full 18 seconds in front of Bottas, with Leclerc 19sec back. Vettel secured the fastest lap of the race.Hamilton’s 79th career victory is his second in a row at Paul Ricard.Mercedes, who took their first F1 win at the French Grand Prix in Reims with Juan Manuel Fangio in 1954, were in control all weekend and Hamilton was able to turn the dominance he showed in qualifying into a fearsome performance in race pace.Hamilton now has six wins from eight meetings this season, including the last four in a row. That more are to follow this season seems inevitable. He has extended his lead over Bottas to 36 points in the world championship, while Vettel has fallen 76 points back.The initial charge Bottas made to open the season looks to be faltering in the face of Hamilton once more coming in to his own. After qualifying Hamilton suggested he would only be getting stronger and on this form it is hard to disagree with him. He did not allow his teammate a look-in across the 53 laps in another display of precision driving.For Vettel, who qualified poorly, and Leclerc, they managed to maximise what they could with a car that was demonstrably not as quick though the corners, despite making time back in the two big straights. As things stand, as Hamilton suggested on Saturday, the title fight is at best now a two horse race between the British driver and his teammate.Hamilton held his lead from Bottas into turn one, with the Finn just holding off Leclerc to maintain second. Verstappen had a mighty look at Leclerc into turn two but could not quite get his nose in front and the front four held their grid positions to the end of the first lap.Carlos Sainz went round the outside of Lando Norris to take fifth through turn one but the two McLarens were unable hold Vettel behind them for long. Vettel took sixth on lap five and set off after Sainz, passing him for fifth on lap seven, putting him eight seconds behind Verstappen in fourth.Hamilton opened up two seconds on Bottas by lap seven, with the gap to Leclerc already at five seconds. The British driver was in control putting in a series of fastest laps which Bottas could match but without any form of pace advantage that would give him a chance to challenge.Hamilton had looked serene but informed Mercedes he believed his seat was broken on lap 14. The issue appeared to have no effect on his times as he continued to set more fastest laps, extending his lead over Bottas to four seconds by lap 17.As the pit stop window opened Verstappen was the first of the front runners to take the hard rubber on lap 21. Ferrari covered his stop a lap later bringing in Leclerc, by now focused on maintaining their third place.Mercedes kept their drivers out however with Hamilton still confident in his tyres, as his strong lap times continued to show. Bottas came in first on lap 24 and Hamilton followed him a lap later.Vettel was going long however and stayed out and Hamilton emerged just in front of the German, who finally pitted on lap 26 after a lock-up was causing him vibration.Mercedes were in a class of their own out front while both Ferraris were focused on trying to beat Verstappen’s Red Bull. Leclerc had the lead over the Dutchman and Vettel was five seconds back, positions they would hold to the close.Hamilton however was in no mood to relinquish any pressure and pumped in a series of quick laps. His lead to Bottas was an almost unprecedented 12 seconds by lap 34. A late VSC to deal with a loose bollard added no drama to the finale, the victory that followed was as assured a win as he has taken all season.McLaren finished with Carlos Sainz in sixth while Britain’s Lando Norris, who had looked on for seventh until stymied by hydraulic problems could manage only tenth. Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault was in seventh, with his teammate Nico Hülkenberg in ninth. Kimi Räikkönen in the Alfa Romeo was in eighth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00c3902ed97d239c6fd6b0d2703cb036f72b2d45/0_189_3047_1829/master/3047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6425633e1e734ced1b93d26d29be65b0","title":"shakib al hasan bangladesh afghanistan cricket world cup","story":"The talismanic all-rounder has proven his worth with bat and ball at the World Cup. Now he must lead his nation beyond a buoyant Afghanistan teamThe World Cup so far has seen the best of Shakib Al Hasan, a cricketer who any team in this tournament would sign up with a passport the next day. Shakib does the job of two highly effective players for Bangladesh: batting with full responsibility and leading a bowling attack. His performances against South Africa, New Zealand, England and West Indies have been as good as any in the World Cup. Only Lance Klusener and Yuvraj Singh, in 1999 and 2011 respectively, come to mind although Shakib perhaps needs more time to emulate both and land the man-of-the-tournament award.Shakib sits second among the leading runscorers at this one, sandwiched by the 447 of David Warner and Joe Root’s 424 while boasting a greater strike rate than either. He does not look a million‑dollar batsman, but he is mightily effective. Data analysts may mention his out-of-control shots but in this tournament it has hardly mattered. He will go for them regardless of where they might land, because there is no dearth of confidence in Shakib.He will need it on Monday in Southampton. Bangladesh need to win all their matches to remain in contention for the semi-finals, so beating an Afghanistan team buoyed by their narrow loss to India is very important.There are few cricketers in the world who have so many strings to their bow as Shakib. He is a top-order batsman who can score quickly as well as stabilise an innings. He bowls accurate left‑arm spin with a speciality arm ball, and is capable of leading a bowling attack in any format. He is an athletic presence in and out of the circle, with a strong arm from the deep and assurance as a fielder.Shakib is also Bangladesh’s Test and T20 captain, serving his second stint since the start of last year. He leads by example, with many cricketers in the country aspiring to be him. Some of the younger players in the side became cricket fans after seeing Shakib and followed his path into the senior side.What many have failed to mimic, though, is Shakib’s personality and attitude. It is unique to Bangladesh that a person with so much talent can deliberately detach himself from the popularity that follows. Commercially, he is the most successful cricketer in Bangladesh but his ability to compartmentalise has made him even more successful.His character provides the perfect balance to an emotional Bangladesh team who swing from one extreme to the other depending on how they are performing. But his training methods can sometimes infuriate coaches and teammates, because the 32-year-old basically runs through the motions. You would not see him do a whole day’s work like Tamim Iqbal or Mushfiqur Rahim, or spend a lot of time in the gym like the ODI captain Mashrafe Mortaza. Shakib has his own method, and much of it is mental preparation.That is not to say he does not prepare at all. Having set his sights on the World Cup and with his Indian Premier League side Sunrisers Hyderabad hardly utilising him in this year’s competition, Shakib used the time to build himself. He even flew in his childhood mentor, Mohammad Salahuddin, for extra batting sessions in Mumbai.Four years ago, when he was not completing his bowling action like he used to, Shakib made a Skype call to his childhood coach Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, who was the head of cricket at his alma mater BKSP (the national sports institute). Shakib shadow-bowled in his hotel room in front of his phone while Fahim provided tips. Shakib took four wickets the next day.His track record says more about him than his methods. He is the fastest to many all-round milestones in all formats, including 6,000 runs and 200 wickets in ODIs, as well as the fastest to a 3,000-run-and 200-wicket combination in Tests, beating Ian Botham by one game.His biggest impact as a player is how he has lifted Bangladesh from small fry to a progressively improving team. And he has done so with one performance after another, since 2009 when he struck his sensational innings against Sri Lanka. Then came his stunning effort against New Zealand in the 2010 ODI series.The Test side were virtually a one-man show for many years, including several doubles like a fifty and five wickets, a fifty and 10 wickets, two fifties and a five-wicket haul as well as a 10-wicket haul and a hundred. There are so many such instances that it is easy to call him the best all-rounder in the world. If there remains any doubt, he has set about dispelling it at this World Cup.Mohammad Isam is the Bangladesh correspondent of ESPNcricinfo"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/564ef0dd84cc978a02046cce814f587671aa66f7/0_116_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263129a646294b0713387eff95c3b898","title":"andy murray and feliciano lopez v rajeev ram and joe salisbury queens doubles final live","story":"Second set: MurrayLopez* 7-6, 1-1 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Lopez wallops an ace down the middle to hold to 30.Second set: MurrayLopez 7-6, 0-1 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Ram and Salisbury will need to clear their heads quickly. They served for the opening set and also led 5-1 in the tie-break. Encouragingly, they begin with a hold to 15 for Salisbury.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez 8-6 Ram*Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram serves. He’s drawn to the net. Lopez has a few attempts at passing him - and eventually Ram dabs a volley wide! First set tie-break: Murray*Lopez 7-6 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury blocks a return long. Murray and Lopez have a set point.First set tie-break: Murray*Lopez 6-6 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Ram nets a forehand off a tight second serve from Murray.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez 5-6 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez sends a backhand return just wide. Set point for Ram and Salisbury.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez 5-5 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): A fizzing Murray backhand return leaves Salisbury on his knees. That looked nasty for a moment, but it seems Salisbury’s fine to continue.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez* 4-5 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury sends a forehand long by a whisker.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez 2-5 Ram*Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray gets one back.First set tie-break: Murray*Lopez 1-4 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury gives another Murray serve the treatment, a forehand down the line too good for Lopez.First set tie-break: Murray*Lopez 1-3 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): A smart Ram return draws an errant volley from a stooping Murray.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez 1-2 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Ram makes up for it with a clever volley.First set tie-break: MurrayLopez* 0-1 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Lopez butchers a smash! Put it down to fatigue.First set: MurrayLopez 6-6 Ram*Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram holds to love to force a tie-break.First set: Murray*Lopez 6-5 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): After all that excitement Murray messes up the first point with one of his worst every volleys. 0-15. Yet Murray finds his serve again. He holds to 30, swinging one down the middle and out of Ram’s reach.First set: MurrayLopez 5-5 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Salisbury is serving for the set. It goes to 30-all and Lopez makes it 30-40 with a cracking forehand down the line. It’s effectively two break points. But Ram is strong enough at the net to deal with a Murray backhand, Lopez unable to deal with it. A deciding point, then. But it’s still a break point - and that’s the cue for Murray’s return to click into gear, a low forehand forcing Salisbury to volley long. “Let’s go!” Murray roars.First set: MurrayLopez* 4-5 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Lopez is serving to keep the opening set alive. And he holds to 15. Sir Joe Salisbury will serve for it.First set: MurrayLopez 3-5 Ram*Salisbury (*denotes server): You sense a Ram service game offers an instant opportunity for Murray and Lopez to break back, a feeling that grows when the American finds himself down 0-30 again. But he responds with three straight points and holds thanks to a sharp volley from Salisbury.First set: Murray*Lopez 3-4 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Some wonderful doubles shenanigans at 0-15. Lopez has to scramble back to the baseline to reach a volley and he shows a surprising turn of pace to get there before hooking a deep forehand back into play, at which point Salisbury nets a smash. Murray’s serve is coming under pressure, though, and he finds himself facing two break points when Salisbury pounces on a poor volley from the Scot. The rangy Salisbury’s looking the sharpest player out there. And it’s fitting that he’s the one to seal the break with a lovely forehand down the line. “Come on!” he cries.First set: MurrayLopez 3-3 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez is stretching a fair bit during the changeover. He must be aching after his exertions. Meanwhile Murray’s a little bit annoyed with his return at the moment. It’s not quite there yet and it allows Salisbury to 40-15. Salisbury holds to 40-30 when a hopeful Murray lob drops long.First set: MurrayLopez* 3-2 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Lopez drops the first point on serve, but he rattles through the next three. Then he seals another hold with a crisp forehand volley. It’s been a good, tight start to the final.First set: MurrayLopez 2-2 Ram*Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury’s under fire at the net on the first point. Eventually he finds a Murray backhand too hot to handle. These are worrying times for Ram and Salisbury. A double-fault from Ram makes it 0-30. The American’s not finding his first serve. But his second clicks just well enough to force 30-all. Then he clicks into gear, sending an ace down the middle for 40-30. The American holds.First set: Murray*Lopez 2-1 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point easily enough. Then Lopez stands firm at the net to repel a Ram forehand with an accurate volley for 30-0. At 40-0 Ram drills a backhand return down the line. Lovely shot. That one’s not coming back. Then Ram and Salisbury combine well to make it 40-30, the former’s forehand volley doing the job. Yet Murray holds to 30 when he whacks a backhand from left to right at the net.First set: MurrayLopez 1-1 RamSalisbury* (*denotes server): Joe Salisbury to serve. It would be understandable if he’s feeling a bit nervous about sharing a court with a rather famous opponent. But the local lad has to ignore the Murray factor. The first two points are shared. It goes to 30-all. Then Salisbury bangs an ace down the middle for 40-30. But Murray responds with a fizzing backhand return down the line for deuce. In doubles it’s a deciding point. And although the returners choose Salisbury has to deliver to Murray again, this time the serve’s good enough to outfox the Scot.First set: MurrayLopez* 1-0 RamSalisbury (*denotes server): It’s the singles champion, Feliciano Lopez, to open the doubles final – and he makes a good start, racing through a few serves to set up a 40-0 lead. He doesn’t look tired at all! Give it half an hour or so, though, then we’ll see. Still, a hold to love.Here come the players! This is what the crowd have been waiting for. The chance to seeThe doubles final is going to begin at 5.30pm. Enough time for Feliciano Lopez to get a quick massage.Lopez adds he doesn’t have much energy left. “I’m going to speak to Andy now. He’s going to be responsible now.” Feliciano Lopez, probably the first tournament director to win a tournament, speaks! “The whole match was very exciting, except the first set, where he didn’t play very good. I took this set but then he got better and better and it was really tough for me. The tie-break at the end was a lottery and it went my way.”Feliciano Lopez beams as he collects his trophy. It’s a wonder if he can lift the trinket above his head. Feliciano Lopez has won the singles final! He’s beaten Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, but he has no time to put his feet up. Now he’s got to play the doubles final with Sir Andy Murray. They take on Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram soon.Ashleigh Barty is the new world No1! The French Open champion beat Julia Goerges to claim the title in Birmingham earlier.The singles final is going to three sets. Gilles Simon has knuckled down and won the second on a tie-break. Andy Murray will have to wait.“Afternoon Jacob,” Simon McMahon says. “I’ve missed Andy. Tennis has missed Andy. To win a doubles title in his first tournament back just six months after career saving surgery would be quite something. To see him compete in Grand Slam singles in 2020 would be quite something else. And who’s to say he won’t win another one? Not me, that’s for sure. COME ON ANDY!!!”Tennis has missed Andy. It hasn’t been as fun without him. It hasn’t been Andy enough.Feliciano Lopez has won the first set of the singles final 6-2. The man’s a machine! Speaking of splendid 37-year-olds, by the way, elsewhere Roger Federer’s won a record 10th Halle title after beating David Goffin in the final.Poor Joe Salisbury. Putney’s finest reaches the doubles final at Queen’s and who does he find waiting for him on the other side of the net? Andy Murray, that’s who. Only the greatest British player of all time. How’s your luck, Joe?What a story, though. Murray being Murray, of course, perhaps we should have expected this from him as he embarks on what almost counts as a second career after all the pain he’s gone through. Six months ago, though, we were all writing the obituaries. Everyone remembers that emotional press conference before the Australian Open, when it seemed he was on the verge of retirement, and assumed he’d played his final ever match when he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round in Melbourne. Only, it turned out Murray wasn’t ready to say goodbye. He went under the knife again, switched the faulty hip for a metal one and set about preparing for a dramatic return. And here we are. With a man who was using his racquet as a crutch not so long ago in the doubles final in his first tournament back since hip surgery. It really is ridiculous.But that’s Murray for you, always ready to surprise, never willing to give in without a fight. Having said that, mind you, what’s stood out about this comeback is how happy he’s looked on court so far. The limp and grimace have both gone and Murray just looks like he’s delighted to be playing tennis again. He isn’t fighting he’s just enjoying himself and it’s delightful to watch.Not that the fiery competitive spirit has disappeared, of course. No chance of that happening. Instead Murray’s making big plans. He’s off to Eastbourne with Brazil’s Marcelo Melo, then he’s off to Wimbledon to play with the excellent Pierre Hugues-Herbert and he also wants a mixed doubles partner at SW19 (Serena? Venus? Judy?). The ultimate aim is to get back into singles. But before all that he needs to win this match. It might not be straightforward, though, given that his partner, the 37-year-old Feliciano Lopez, appears to be involved in a charity tennisathon. Yesterday Lopez reached the singles final after seeing off Canada’s Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Then he had a short break. Then he helped Murray polish off their rain-delayed quarter-final against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski. Then he helped Murray win their semi-final against Henri Kontinen and John Peers. It was almost 9pm by the time he was done. He must be knackered.What’s more, the Spaniard has to get his singles final against Gilles Simon done before this match begins. Absurd. Who knows what state he’ll be in by the end of the day? One thing’s for sure: he’s bound to be stiff and that could play work against him. Salisbury, a 27-year-old Londoner who reached the Wimbledon semis last year, and the USA’s Rajeev Ram knocked out doubles legends the Bryans brothers yesterday. They aren’t to be taken lightly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15c302c7deacfba11d9cc5e6d22873ca09090a0/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23efb76682c766aa7fe32903a8df7918","title":"french grand prix f1 live","story":"The defending world champion won his sixth race of the season, his fourth in succession, by leading from beginning to end at Paul RicardHere’s Giles Richards’ report from Paul Ricard. Here’s the confirmed final standings, barring legal challenge...Lando Norris succinctly sums up how his race ended. The three on the podium speak before they have a rather stilted encounter with Jackie Stewart on the way to receiving trophies and spraying champagne. Hamilton: “It was a very good weekend. I have been racing a long time and this never gets old. I just try to find the edge and I couldn’t do without this incredible team and all the guys back at the factory. I am hyped, it’s a beautiful day in the South of France but it is sweaty. It is very bumpy and actually an awesome track to drive. It wasn’t easy at all. There’s always things happening…this has been the best start ever to the year.”Bottas: “He is not unbeatable. I will have to work hard to beat him.”Leclerc: “I have tried everything. In the last two laps, I was getting quite close. I believed in him until the last minute.”Celebrating the extension of his championship lead to 36 points, his sixth win of the season and his fourth in succession, Hamilton hugs his teammates, giving props to the engineers and staff in the interview that immediately follows victory. A jubilant Hamilton thanks his team for an “an awesome weekend” and all his complaints of the afternoon are forgotten. Norris, meanwhile, looks to have been overtaken by unfair means, with Ricciardo cutting across him and that will be under investigation. He lost three places as a result of that. Will these standings, er, stand? Lap 5353: Hamilton rolling home to reach the finish, while Charles Leclerc is right on the tail of Bottas, and is within 0.7 seconds of the second placed car. He makes a last-ditch attempt to get there but falls short. Oh no! Ricciardo has overtaken Norris, as have Raikkonen and Hulkenberg...Norris drops down to tenth. Can Vettel claim the fastest lap?...Yes, he can. Lap 5253: Vettel does go into the pits after all in his search for the fastest lap. Norris, who has been lapped by Hamilton, is battling desperately to hold Ricciardo. Really great driving from the teenager. Lap 5153: Verstappen says his tyres are “pretty f***ked” and it seems that Vettel will look to chase down his rival for fourth rather than go into the pit to get fast tyres on. Lap 5053: Hamilton has helped Norris’ cause a little, stopping his chasers being able to hunt down their prey. There is a loose bollard on the track and now there is a virtual safety car as a steward makes a brave burst to rescue it. Lap 4853: Hulkenberg and Raikkonen is the battle for ninth and tenth. Ricciardo is in eighth, and has been lapped by Hamilton as soon will be Norris. The Mercedes team tell him not to be too daft near Norris as bits may be dropping off the McLaren. Lap 4753: Romain Grosjean has to retire in his Haas car. Up ahead, Lando Norris is having untold trouble, telling the radio that his car is now heavy. Must be like driving a B-Reg VW Polo with five passengers and no power steering up a farm track. And the man on the line says it is only going to get worse. Lap 4653: Kyvat and Albon, teammates for Toro Rosso, are going at it with each other down that Mistral straight, that from Chequered Flag. That’s a battle for 15th and 16th, and that’s where the thrills are coming in this race. Albon is holding off his team-mates. Lap 4553: Fastest lap now with Bottas as Hamilton is told not to risk all to try and win it back. Vettel is soon to come in for an extra pit lane to be put on the fastest tyres possible to claim that vital point. Lap 4453: Norris is having to hold off Ricciardo, Raikkonen and Hulkenberg, who are in eighth, ninth and tenth. The gap to Ricciardo is dropping fast. Lap 4353: Another fastest lap by Hamilton, who is totally cruising to victory, a sixth of the season. This is an awesome display of Mercedes strength. Lando Norris is warned that his hydraulics are jiggered as he tells his team he is having problems. They tell him to do as best as he can. Lap 4253: Leclerc has set a fastest lap, which would give him an extra point if he hold on to that, or extends it...but no, Hamilton claims it back, after being warned by his team of his ailing tyres. He says he is OK with them. Lap 4053: Lando Norris is told he is not allowed to use DRS to overtake Sainz up ahead of him. The McLarens go past Lance Stroll of Racing Point and up to sixth and seventh as Stroll drops to 13th after a long wait for a pit. Lap 3953: Bottas is told by his team that he has blistering on his tyres, but that he has nothing to worry about. Lap 3853: Discussion among the McLaren cars, and the drivers are being asked to pick up the pace. Lando Norris acts a bit teenage when asked to do so, indicating that Carlos Sainz ahead of him is not exactly giving it full gas. Lap 3753: Let’s be fair here, this has not been a classic, after Canada being so full of intrigue and a near-classic at Monaco. A rain shower is required to liven things up, perhaps a shower of pastis to sticky up the track. Meanwhile, Grosjean’s attempt to tell tales on Ricciardo has come to nowt. The stewards will not be doing anything about that flashpoint. Lap 3653: Hulkenberg went into the pits, but ended up dropping down to 11th, having been in seventh. He was not helped by a rather slow pit stop. This spoke too soon. Lap 3553: Lewis Hamilton complains that the tyres he is on now are not as good as those he started on as he heads for his sixth win of the season. You have to be suffer to beautiful, as they say. Lap 3353: Ricciardo up to 10th as he overtakes Kyvat, and goes into the points. It’s been a hard day in the Renault for him. Lap 3253: Hamilton sets the fastest lap again, and despite his seating problems this has been an armchair ride for him.Lap 3153: The stewards are having a look at that GrosjeanRicciardo tete a tete, but it seems unlikely that they will act. Ricciardo has problems, and one of them is that his drinking straw is not working. He will be absolutely parched at the end of this race. Lap 2953: Bottas fights back and sets a fastest lap. Back in the field, Grosjean and Ricciardo have had a spat, with the Frenchman making a complaint about the way the Aussie overtook him. Lap 2853: Bottas under a bit of pressure, though, as Leclerc begins to make inroads. There’s 3.66 seconds between them where the gap to Hamilton is a mighty 11.8 seconds. Lap 2653: Vettel, at last, comes in, and having failed to land a blow on the leaders, is now in fifth, behind Verstappen, who made his stop in the 20th lap. Let’s see if that can be the battle to provide entertainment. The race at the front is turning into a procession. Lap 2453: In goes Bottas, who then concedes a place to Vettel, but stays ahead of Leclerc. Hamilton continues to be the quickest on his tyres but here comes the change, which takes just 2.2 seconds, and he comes out of the pit lane and still ahead of Vettel and Bottas. If this is a one-stop strategy, then the race is his, barring someone letting Mahaveer Raghunathan loose in the second half of the race.

I wanted to build a partnership with Babar Azam – it was not easy but we did well.”South Africa are mathematically gone, although they could still have a say in who makes the semi-finals. Their remaining matches are against Sri Lanka and Australia. Pakistan have three must-win games - just the way they like them - against New Zealand, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. If they win all three they will pick up 11 points, which could be enough to finish above England or perhaps New Zealand. If England lose to Australia at Lord’s on Tuesday, things will get very hairy. 50th over: South Africa 259-9 (Phehlukwayo 46, Tahir 1) Andile Phehlukwayo goes down swinging, taking 11 from Amir’s final over. But Pakistan win the game comfortably to keep their World Cup hopes alive. It’s on! (Possibly.)This is a stunning old-ball spell from Wahab. He gets his first third wicket with a Wasim Akram tribute that is angled in from around the wicket and straightens to hit off stump. It was too good for Allan Lamb in 1992, so it was bound to be too good for Lungi Ngidi. 48th over: South Africa 246-8 (Phehlukwayo 34, Ngidi 1) South Africa need 63 from 12 balls. Not even in Stick Cricket could they win this. 47th over: South Africa 239-8 (Phehlukwayo 28, Ngidi 0) Imagine if Australia beat England on Tuesday and Pakistan beat New Zealand on Wednesday. Should that happen, there will be what I believe the young folks describe as “scenes”.Wahab gets his second wicket with a low, reverse-swinging full toss that thuds into Rabada’s middle stump. Not for the first time in this tournament, South Africa are going down with a whimper. They’ve been almost bewilderingly poor.46th over: South Africa 237-7 (Phehlukwayo 28, Rabada 2) Mohammad Amir concedes his first boundary of the day from the penultimate ball of his eighth over, when Phehlukwayo whaps a low full toss to cow corner. He top-edges a hook for four off the next delivery as well. South Africa need just 72 from 24 balls. Wahab Riaz joins in the fun, bowling Morris with a blistering leg-stump yorker. Pakistan are heading for an emphatic victory.44th over: South Africa 221-6 (Phehlukwayo 15, Morris 16) Phehlukwayo heaves a slog-sweep for four off Shadab, who finishes a fine afternoon’s work with figures of 10-1-50-3. South Africa need a deluxe Brathwaite, or 88 from 36 balls. 43rd over: South Africa 213-6 (Phehlukwayo 9, Morris 14) A bit of defiance for Morris, who cuts Afridi for four before check-driving a gorgeous straight six. Sixteen from the over.“Yet again SA’s batsmen fail to impose themselves on a bowling attack,” says Richard Mansell. “They’ve been pitiful this tournament. The team has barely threatened any of its opponents.”I suppose nobody can accuse them of choking this time.. They haven’t been in a position to do so. It’s been a desperately disappointing tournament for them, one that will surely end a few ODI careers.42nd over: South Africa 197-6 (Phehlukwayo 3, Morris 3) Phehlukwayo survives a big LBW appeal after missing a reverse sweep at Shadab. He was hit on the full and it looked very close Joel Wilson said not out.Another one gone! Miller makes room to blast Afridi through the off side. He misses, Afridi hits with a slower ball, and South Africa are heading for another heavy defeat.40th over: South Africa 189-5 (Miller 30, Phehlukwayo 0) So, South Africa are officially out of the World Cup, and Pakistan will enter Wednesday’s game against New Zealand in Cornered Tiger mode. If they win their last three matches they may yet sneak into the semis ahead of England or even New Zealand.David Miller has an LBW decision overturned on review. He tried to sweep a googly from Shadab and was given out, but reviewed it instantly. Replays showed why he was so confident: there was a slight underedge onto the pad.Pakistan have taken a catch! It was a smart, aggressive move from Sarfaraz to bring back Shadab at a time when South Africa had to take so many risks, and he struck with his fourth ball. van der Dussen sliced a big shot high in the air towards cover, where Hafeez just about held on.39th over: South Africa 186-4 (van der Dussen 35, Miller 29) Miller has given this South African innings some belated urgency. The required rate is surely too high, though. A fine over from Wahab, including a couple of terrific slower balls, pushes it above 11.38th over: South Africa 182-4 (van der Dussen 33, Miller 27) A big over for South Africa - 14 from it. Miller lashes Shaheen through the covers for four, and then van der Dussen clouts a mighty six over midwicket. South Africa still have an outside chance, although they need almost 11 an over.37th over: South Africa 168-4 (van der Dussen 26, Miller 21) Both South African batsmen are dropped off consecutive Wahab deliveries! Oh, Pakistan. The keeper Sarfaraz put down a fairly simple chance to catch van der Dussen, and Amir dropped an even easier one at third man to dismiss Miller.“While we’re on the topic,” says Abhijato Sensarma, “Mickey Arthur always looks like he’s just seen Vince edge another one to second slip.”I hope they had a camera on him during that last over.36th over: South Africa 163-4 (van der Dussen 23, Miller 19) Shaheen Afridi returns to the attack and almost picks up van der Dussen, who walks across, misses, and is lucky that the ball sneaks past his leg stump.35th over: South Africa 160-4 (van der Dussen 23, Miller 17) Wahab replaces Imad Wasim and is biffed through extra cover for four by Miller. His groin injury doesn’t seem to be affecting him too much. His power hitting is South Africa’s best chance of an unlikely victory. They need 149 from the last 15 overs.“How good has the renaissance of Amir been?” says Andrew Hurley. “I know there have been many impressive fast bowlers in the World Cup, but Amir has generally been bowling at the other end to a bowler leaking a lot of runs, so perhaps for that reason (if stats alone don’t show it?), I would have him slightly ahead...”Yes, agreed. Amir, Shakib and Williamson have been the biggest stars so far, in my etc. That said, I’m hopelessly biased when it comes to Amir.34th over: South Africa 152-4 (van der Dussen 21, Miller 11) A nasty lifter from Amir is taken on the glove by van der Dussen. Amir has bowled two high-class spells: 4-1-9-1 and 3-0-10-1.33rd over: South Africa 150-4 (van der Dussen 20, Miller 10) Miller, on the run, drives Imad’s first delivery over the top for four. Imad finishes a useful spell with figures of 10-0-48-0, and South Africa are running out of time. They need 159 from 17 overs.“Dear Rob,” writes Renuka Dhinakaran. “My poor husband Anand, a frequent OBO commentator, has gone through a day of Lego workshop and gym show week with our kid while the Pak v SA match has been happening. He didn’t snarl as he usually would have and I’m grateful to OBO for that. This also seems to be a good time and place to tell him that he has to take the trash out.”32nd over: South Africa 143-4 (van der Dussen 19, Miller 4) Mohammad Amir drops Miller off his own bowling! He clasped the ball in his right hand but it fell out when his elbow hit the ground. That would have put him out on his own as the leading wickettaker in the tournament. He has a big appeal for caught behind turned down later in the over when Miller tries to hook. Amir is desperate to review but Sarfaraz turns him down both have apparently forgotten that Pakistan have already used their review. Not that it matters - there was nothing on Ultra Edge.31st over: South Africa 140-4 (van der Dussen 18, Miller 2) “Who has been the most frustrating cricketer to watch this World Cup?” says Tuvic Tuslow. “For me, it’s Markram he’s the Proteas James Vince - looks perennially good, but gets out too soon, too often.”I think the James Vince Award for most frustrating cricketer at any tournament should go to James Vince, even when he’s not playing.30th over: South Africa 138-4 (van der Dussen 17, Miller 1) “Hi Rob,” says Jon Salisbury. “Am I not getting something or are these ‘phases won’ stats (like the day’s pie-charts for Tests) a useless gimmick subjective at best and shows no real feel for the game.”I’m not a fan, but I suspect they enhance the viewing experience for millions so I’m loath to go the full Bill Murray on them.Mohammad Amir is wonderful. Pakistan needed a wicket he delivered it with the third ball of a new spell. du Plessis clouted a cross-seam delivery miles in the air, and Sarfaraz waved everyone away before taking the catch. Amir has his 15th wicket of the tournament, a spectacular personal performance in a hitherto losing team.29th over: South Africa 133-3 (du Plessis 61, van der Dussen 15) South Africa need 176 from 21 overs. Hmm.“Although she’s proudly Australian, and tribal, Ashleigh Barty’s also one of our own,” says John Starbuck. “Some of her family (on her Mum’s side) are still in Nottingham and she played for quite a while at the West Bridgford Tennis Club, not far from Trent Bridge. Well done her!”28th over: South Africa 130-3 (du Plessis 60, van der Dussen 13) van der Dussen ks Shadab straight back over his head, and the ball just evades the stretching Amir as he runs round the boundary. To compound Mickey Arthur’s visible frustration, the ball bounces up onto Amir and over the boundary for four. du Plessis completes a good over for South Africa – 12 from it – with a lusty slog sweep for four.27th over: South Africa 118-3 (du Plessis 55, van der Dussen 6) Still no boundaries for South Africa – the last was in the 19th over – but they are at least in a rhythm of scoring from most deliveries. It might be time to bring back Mohammad Amir for a couple of overs.26th over: South Africa 112-3 (du Plessis 51, van der Dussen 4) The captain du Plessis drives Shadab for a single to reach a dogged fifty from 66 balls. There’s a single from every delivery in that over.25th over: South Africa 106-3 (du Plessis 48, van der Dussen 1) Pakistan are squeezing the life out of South Africa. The last six overs, all bowled by Shadab and Imad, have brought two wickets and only 16 runs. Well, that was odd. du Plessis tried to force Imad off the back foot, prompting a huge appeal for caught behind from Sarfaraz and then an instant review. But there was nothing on Ultra Edge, so du Plessis survives.Sarfaraz is certain this is out.24th over: South Africa 103-3 (du Plessis 46, van der Dussen 0) A wicket maiden from Shadab, and this has has the feel of a matchwinning spell from Shadab: 5-1-17-2.Markram has gone, cleaned up by a lovely flipper from Shadab. It may have kept a little low, too, and Markram was left looking pretty silly as he tried to cut a ball that skidded on to hit the stumps.23rd over: South Africa 103-2 (du Plessis 46, Markram 7) A slightly better over for South Africa, but still only five from it. Faf du Plessis hasn’t hit a boundary since the 12th over.22nd over: South Africa 98-2 (du Plessis 43, Markram 5) Just three singles from the over again, this time Shadab the bowler. South Africa need 211 from 28 overs, and you would be unwise to stake your mortgage on them.21st over: South Africa 95-2 (du Plessis 42, Markram 3) Imad Wasim returns, a logical tactic with a new batsman at the crease. Sarfaraz will want him and Shadab to hurry through a few cheap overs, the old Combined Universities 1989 tactic. Three singles from the over."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c40283a42d310540820cc0be2adb62881b1b99/562_185_3346_2007/master/3346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d91ff7e164a883fcfe14233a089db1","title":"after dark review finborough london","story":"Finborough, LondonDion Boucicault’s convoluted melodrama is elevated by the earnestness and imagination of Phil Willmott’s canny revival“Spare me the theatricals,” pleads a character in Dion Boucicault’s 1868 Victorian melodrama. Since the play includes forged cheques, lost fathers, music-hall medleys and suicide bids before advancing trains, it is advice that Boucicault himself hardly heeded.But although, as drama, the piece is palpably absurd, it is put across with great panache by director Phil Willmott and his 12-strong cast.Boucicault has lately enjoyed a mini-boon, with revivals of London Assurance and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ version of An Octoroon. After Dark is not in that league, hinging as it does on a beleaguered aristocrat’s need to desert his common-law wife and marry a cousin in order to claim his inheritance. The plot is convoluted and the characters paper-thin. The real interest lies in Boucicault’s vision of the teeming tumult of the London streets populated by penniless Crimean veterans, crooks and thieves, and hymn-singing harbingers of the Salvation Army. We’re reminded that in 1868 the London Underground was still a thrilling novelty.Willmott and his designer, Hannah Postlethwaite, cleverly evoke all this through smoke, lights and two rotating brick arches. The cast play with hand on heart rather than tongue in cheek and there is especially good work from Toby Wynn-Davies as a bent lawyer, Victoria Jeffrey as a malapropistic music-hall queen who talks of “a case of mistaken adultery” and Jemima Watling as the hero’s abandoned wife seeking a watery grave. This may be a ripely preposterous piece of popular theatre but it is done with a fine, unpatronising flourish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b9f95179b78fadcf6c75fc898fde188bc98942/0_264_4801_2881/master/4801.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f5e9149fff3c4477f26fc82ba87666","title":"artistic directors shaking up british theatre lynette linton suba das tarek iskander","story":"Our critic reflects on the exciting developments sweeping our stages and below, some of the top new recruits share their stories and ways of workingBritish theatre is in the process of a massive change. More far-reaching than any I have seen in more than 20 years as the Observer’s drama critic. Accelerating. Overdue. Irrevocable. Welcome.There used to be a template for the artistic directors of theatres. A template about as restricted as candidates for the Tory party leadership. White and male. Obviously. This was so continuous with the default position for power in Britain that for ages it went unremarked. Not any more. At the press conference to announce his opening season as artistic director of the Donmar in April, Michael Longhurst was asked if, as a white man, he now found himself in a minority among new appointees. Yes, he said. “Quite rightly.”The shift from all-maleness has come in spurts, since the beginning of the 2000s, when Gemma Bodinetz took over at Liverpool, and Vicky Featherstone headed up the new National Theatre of Scotland. The end of the whitewashing of British theatre (or, rather, the beginning of the end) came later – but is moving more decisively. Last year was crucial: a series of appointments of people of colour reordered the alphabet of artistic directorships. From Justin Audibert to Matthew Xia.A look at London’s Young Vic, where Kwame Kwei-Armah took over last year, demonstrates what a difference a new theatrical head can make. His task looked hard: his predecessor, David Lan, had run a superb theatre. But Kwei-Armah has already proved there is another kind of superb. His programming has been distinctive and bold, mashing up text with music (a carnival Twelfth Night) triumphantly casting black actors in parts previously considered the realm of white performers (Death of a Salesman), putting on work that merges dance and installation art (Bronx Gothic). The atmosphere in the bar is galvanising. A couple of years ago, the actor Janet Suzman claimed that “theatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it”. The Young Vic is a living refutation of this. As is Stratford East, a theatre reignited by the dynamism of its new artistic director, Nadia Fall. Fall says: “Diversity is not our endgame. Our endgame has to be quality of work.” So no plays about her “strict Asian” upbringing – any more than Nicholas Hytner’s National Theatre was heavy with dramas about being Jewish in Manchester. Rather, she has brought a buoyant internationalism – and a fresh emphasis on inventive design. Female designers have been in the vanguard of those remodelling the theatre and its workforce: Rosie Elnile and Joanna Scotcher have made Stratford glow.In bringing new looks, new sounds, new subjects to their theatres, the new directors will expand possibilities and audiences – especially if they keep an eye on ticket prices. In the interviews with the new artistic directors that follow, I was particularly struck by what HighTide’s Suba Das says about reaching out to choreographers and tapping into love of standup. It is hard, though, to guess what changes will be wrought: if we knew what the next thing was it wouldn’t be new. The encouraging thing is that as one barrier is tipped over it nudges the next. The Donmar’s 2012 all-women Shakespeares were a turning point. The publicity was about their femaleness but the productions were Trojan mares, shifting the norm: they featured more black, more brown, more short and more round bodies – and more non-RP accents. We saw talent of which the stage had been starved. We’ll see more under these new bosses. Perhaps we’ll even have many more people of colour as theatre critics.Lynette Linton, 29, was born in Leytonstone, east London, and had early ambitions to be a screen actor. Theatre didn’t appeal to her at first, but after joining the National Youth Theatre in her early 20s and receiving encouragement from director Rikki Beadle-Blair, she turned her attention to writing and directing for the stage. Sustained by a job at John Lewis – she worked in the Oxford Street food hall and edited the retailer’s in-house magazine – Linton wrote her first play, Step, which was staged at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2013. She went on to direct work for the Gate theatre and the Donmar, where her production of Lynn Nottage’s Sweat garnered five-star reviews last December (it transferred to the West End earlier this month).The Bush theatre, in an “incredibly multicultural” area of west London, is renowned as a champion of new writing talent – it premiered early work by writers such as Stephen Poliakoff and Conor McPherson – and as a magnet for erse audiences. Taking over as artistic director from Madani Younis, who is now at the Southbank Centre, Linton is determined to connect with local communities and open up the building even more to younger audiences and creators. “When I was 15, I wasn’t a theatre person,” she says, “so what can I do to make sure 15-year-olds now feel like they are theatre people?”What three words sum up your theatre?Bold, fresh and west-London (we can pretend that’s one word).Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatre-going type…Do you watch Netflix? Do you go to the cinema? If so, just come a little bit further down the road and see a story live. Because it’s all storytelling. And the liveness of theatre is so exciting.What single thing would improve British theatre?Understanding that community work and “professional” work on the stage are the same thing. The community should be feeding the work on the stage, and vice versa. I always have an open rehearsal room. I invite young people to sit in and learn and be part of it and give their opinions. Who are you making it for otherwise?What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?My White Best Friend at the Bunker. It was reacting to events happening that week, and it made me think a lot about theatre’s responsibility to respond to current events.What can’t you live without at work?Yorkshire teabags. That was the first thing I changed at the Bush – they had PG Tips and I was like, “What is this?!” I have five cups a day if I’m in rehearsal it’s worse. My tea is very specific. It’s no sugar, incredibly strong, maybe two drops of milk. You have to put the milk in before taking the teabag out, otherwise it loses its taste. That’s very important.What books are on your bedside table?I have just reread Small Island by Andrea Levy, and I’m about to start Natives by Akala. I saw the production of Small Island at the Olivier and I love Andrea Levy’s writing, so I wanted to spend some more time with the book.Hamilton or Hamlet?Hamilton. It’s one of the best things in years. It’s stunning.Who would be your dream person to work with – dead or alive?James Baldwin. He is one of my biggest inspirations and I remember reading his books at university, Giovanni’s Room and Another Country specifically. He made me see the world differently.What should we come and see at your theatre?Strange Fruit by Caryl Phillips (until 27 July). It’s part of our Passing the Baton scheme, where we revive a work by an artist of colour that should be seen. It’s going to be a phenomenal show. KFIt is quite possibly the most coveted job in British theatre: running London’s Donmar Warehouse, the boutique Covent Garden theatre that consistently punches above its weight. Following in the footsteps of Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage and Josie Rourke, Michael Longhurst has a huge task ahead of him but the 38-year-old seems unfazed.“And we’re off!!!! C’mon down,” he tweeted as he launched his first season in early April under the banner “important stories thrillingly told” and with an air of getting straight down to business.Born in Bromley in 1981, Longhurst studied philosophy at Nottingham University before training as a theatre director at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London. He made his name with Nick Payne’s Constellations, which transferred from the Royal Court to the West End in 2012. Since then his hits have included Amadeus at the National Theatre, They Drink It in the Congo at the Almeida and Caroline, Or Change at the Chichester festival theatre, then in the West End.His mission is “about making sure the most relevant and important stories are hitting our stage”, he says. “We have programmed lots of new writing and revivals that resonate with where the world is at the moment.” They kicked off last week with David Greig’s prophetic Europe, which explores our complex relationship to the continent. “It’s the 25-year anniversary of the play and it reads like it was written yesterday,” Longhurst says.What three words sum up your theatre?Tiny magical warehouse. It’s a miraculous space – 251 seats in the heart of Covent Garden, and the intimacy just makes for this incredible live experience. It’s always described as an actors’ church because you can see the whites of the eyes and the beads of sweat, and that makes for an electric connection.How would you describe your current audience and what will you do to attract new audiences?The current audience is very loyal and generous and they are up for an eclectic mix of work. In terms of new audiences, we will be continuing the Young+Free scheme, giving free tickets to people under 25, and we’re introducing Donmar Daily Release, which means holding back tickets so that 40 can be released every day for a show one week away. This allows people who can’t book in advance to get access to tickets.How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type?I would say that theatre mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form. It is the best way to receive a story today. The days of wobbly french windows and French farces are behind us. Theatre is in a time when it is using its form boldly to tell really exciting stories, and there is nothing like the live event of it.Is British theatre for all?Historically, it hasn’t been. I think it is waking up fast and that has to do with artists and directors being accountable for who is represented on our stages and who gets to make and tell those stories.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?Death of a Salesman at the Young Vic left me weeping. Wendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke were amazing. It’s an astonishing play about the hope that parents have in their children and the desire to please parents that children have. That shifting axis of expectation is heartbreaking and the African American lens that Marianne Elliott’s production put on it made me see the play afresh.Who or what first got you into the theatre?I loved panto as a child. Later, it was my English teacher, Mrs Withers, and my drama teacher, Tom Band, at St John Rigby school in Bromley who ignited my passion. It’s devastating that arts subjects are falling off the curriculum.Do you have a mentor or role model?Dominic Cooke has always been a guiding hand and light for me. He gave me big breaks early on in my career at the Royal Court and sage advice on making art and, now, running companies.What are the top three personal skills that you need as an artistic director?Stamina, stamina, stamina. As a freelance director I could obsessively enter the bubble of making a show. At this moment, when I am in rehearsals the building still needs attention and support and funding. Those things don’t go away while you actually make the art.Favourite art form other than theatre?Impossible to answer. But I do love an art gallery. I think plays are kinetic sculptures. I love the design process of the shows: it’s fascinating and magical to me.Hamilton or Hamlet?I’d like to direct both.Who would be your dream actor to work with?There are so many actors I have as crushes it is hard to name just one, but Billie Piper, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed – call me. LO’KSuba Das was born in 1984 on a council estate in Ashington, near Newcastle, the son of immigrants from rural India. Twice a week his father, a restaurant worker, would take Das and his twin, Deba, to the library, instilling in the brothers a love of learning that helped propel them to scholarships at Newcastle Royal grammar school and then to Cambridge University. After a postgraduate directing course at Birkbeck College, London, Das started out as assistant director at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, going on to direct at Nottingham Playhouse and the Young Vic, among other venues. Most recently, he was associate director at Curve Leicester, where he oversaw the development of new work. His credits at Curve included Wipers by Ishy Din and Pink Sari Revolution by Purva Naresh.Das made his opera debut in 2017, directing the world premiere of Ravi Shankar’s Sukanya for the Royal Opera. Last spring he joined HighTide, the Suffolk-based theatre company and charity dedicated to discovering and launching new playwrights, which produces festivals in Aldeburgh, Edinburgh and, from 2021, also in Lowestoft. His first major challenge was Waltham Forest council unexpectedly withdrawing its funding for this summer’s HighTide festival in Walthamstow, which meant it had to be cancelled. “It was disappointing but, in truth, a sign of the times,” Das says. “We can no longer rely on traditional sources of funding like local authorities. We need to look for new ways to raise money and new ways of reaching erse audiences.”Why is new writing important?We look to art to help us understand ourselves and our world, and new, normally unheard and marginalised voices enable us to look at life from unexpected angles. We are in tumultuous times where we are having to ask ourselves who we are as a society and who we are as people. Theatre needs to be part of that. I’m interested in developing not only new playwrights but spoken word artists, choreographers and physical theatre-makers, too.What single thing would improve British theatre?An understanding that ersity, a word that gets chucked around in an affirmative-action kind of way, actually makes great business sense. The more different types of people you can attract the better.What are the top three skills you need as an artistic director?Generosity, because leadership is about what you are comfortable giving away. Flexibility, because, Lord knows, your diary will change on a day-to-day basis. And fiscal prudence.What books are on your bedside table?Playwriting by the late, great dramatist Stephen Jeffreys, which is the most astonishing analysis of the craft ever. He was a genius on structure and character, the nuts and bolts of it, the practical as well as the ethereal. And Beloved by Toni Morrison, the most important book I have read.How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type?I would say that if you love going to standup comedy, you love going clubbing, you love going to cabaret and you love going to a gig then, actually, you love theatre. LO’KCharlotte Bennett and Katie Posner, who take over as joint artistic directors at the London touring theatre company Paines Plough in August, met while directing separate plays at York Theatre Royal 10 years ago. Bennett, who grew up in Leeds, had just started her own company, Forward Theatre Project, while Posner, a Londoner, was working for York’s Pilot theatre. “Over time, we became artistic mentors to each other,” says Bennett. “And because we were both working with touring companies, we had lots of big chats about the joys and difficulties of that.”A decade on, with Bennett heading up the new writing department at Soho theatre, and Posner directing shows around the country on a freelance basis, both women had their eye on the top job at Paines Plough. When it came up, they decided to pool their strengths rather than compete.Their mission at the 45-year-old company, which focuses entirely on new writing and has worked with writers such as Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Enda Walsh, Abi Morgan and Mike Bartlett, will be “championing the unheard and reaching the overlooked”, according to Bennett. Posner adds: “It’s about finding exciting artists who wouldn’t necessarily define themselves as playwrights, and telling stories in unique and brilliant ways to make the industry wake up.”What three words sum up your theatre?KP Everywhere, unafraid, immediate.Sell theatre to someone who says they’re not the theatre-going type…KP There’s no one size fits all. You just have a conversation with them. “What do you enjoy? What excites you?” I directed a play about football for Northern Stage, and we’d go hang out in pubs in Newcastle and chat to people about what we were doing – and we genuinely saw such a different audience as a result.What single thing would improve British theatre?CB Placing more value on arts in education. With arts subjects going out of the curriculum in schools across the country, it’s sending a message to young people that the arts are not an important part of their lives or career prospects.Which theatre, Britain or beyond, do you most like going to and why?CB Live theatre in Newcastle, because it was born out of a working-class arts movement in the city. There’s no room for ego or pretension, and there’s a real honesty in geordie audiences. Before Margaret Thatcher died, I did a show that contained a quote from her last day in office, saying: “I feel very happy that I’m leaving the country in a better state.” Every night, the audience shouted back: “Fuck off!” It was amazing.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?KP It’s the same for both of us: Misty at the Bush theatre. Arinzé Kene is incredible. Walking into that space and having a visceral reaction to something that grappled with form in an innovative way, it blew our minds.KP The first play I ever fell in love with was Jim Cartwright’s Road. I thought, this has real people, beautiful storytelling and heart-wrenching drama. It all made sense from there.Best production you’ve seen?CB Ruined by Lynn Nottage, directed by Indhu Rubasingham in 2010. I was an usher at the Almeida, so I saw it a lot of times. It was so funny and vibrant and beautiful but also completely devastating and heartbreaking and difficult. It will stay with me for ever.What can’t you live without at work?KP Laughter. If you’ve had a terrible day and things are hard, but you can still have a laugh, then it’s OK.What’s your other favourite art form, and does it feed into your work?CB Books and music. When I listen to music it helps me think about scenes or feelings in scenes.KP Music and sound are a major part of how I make work. The world is never silent, so I’m always working to find ways of integrating sounds and music on stage.Who would be your dream colleague or actor to work with?CB Joan Littlewood, the mother of modern theatre. She was always looking for what was modern, fresh and original.KP Maxine Peake. We just saw her in Avalanche and we love her. KFSean Foley is a proud Brummie, so becoming artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre means coming home. It also means he is deeply aware of the importance of the Rep and its 1971 building in the cultural life of the city and the nation. “It’s a historic theatre, the first in the UK to be based in its own building,” he says. “Pre-National Theatre, it was the place Olivier wanted to go and be seen he trained here along with John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, Paul Scofield – that’s quite some heritage.”Foley made his name as a writer, comedian and actor before turning to directing. He co-founded the Right Size with Hamish McColl, and their stage shows The Play What I Wrote and Do You Come Here Often? became long-running West End and Broadway hits. Other directing credits include Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense, which won an Olivier award in 2014, The Ladykillers, Ducktastic and the unloved X Factor musical I Can’t Sing!. He also directed the 2016 comedy film Mindhorn.His predecessor at the Rep, Roxana Silbert (now at Hampstead theatre), left the company in a strong position, having won praise for her promotion of ersity, championing of accessibility and continued nurturing of new writing. Stepping into her shoes is “a massive challenge”, says Foley.What is your current audience like and how will you attract new ones?They are Brummies, so they’ll be smart, self-deprecating and surprisingly sophisticated. Birmingham people have an amazing dry sense of humour they’re very generous, too. Birmingham has the most youthful demographic in the UK and is actually the most erse city, eclipsing even London. Yet, essentially, theatre is still a middle-class sport. It’s less well-funded than it used to be, but there’s nonetheless a lot of public money going into theatre, and the end results are only reaching a very small proportion of people. So that should change. And changing it is really about making shows that can appeal to a wide demographic and genuinely engage the local population by doing what theatre has done since time immemorial: telling stories that people can relate to in an exciting way.Which theatre in Britain or the rest of the world do you like going to?I really enjoyed St Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, recently. The vibe was great, there was a very mixed audience, and the show was superb. It was The B-Side by the Wooster Group, which consisted of three actors telling the stories behind an album of chain-gang songs and singing them. It was incredibly moving.Who or what got you into theatre?When I was at Oxford University in the mid-80s, I could not get on with any of the drama societies, so I ended up joining the Oxford Youth Theatre. The people who were running it happened to know this bunch of crazy cats who had just come back from a theatre school in Paris and set up their own company with an extremely pretentious name: Théâtre de Complicité. To get free rehearsal space they were giving workshops. I went to a couple and thought, Ah‑ha, this is different.Do you have a mentor or a role model?Kenneth Branagh has been a massive influence. He directed me in The Play What I Wrote and I’ve worked with him many times since then and learned a lot from him about leading creative projects. He is a brilliant leader.What can’t you live without at work?Coffee and bananas, not necessarily in that order.What’s your other favourite art form and does it feed into your work?Film is a big love of mine. One of my heroes is Billy Wilder. He understood the importance of rhythm, pace and storytelling, all of which are essential elements in the way I direct, especially with comedy.What books are on your bedside table?A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood because I am reading it with my book club The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin by David Nobbs because I am trying to make a musical out of it for the Rep and Lowborn by Kerry Hudson because it feels absolutely of this moment.Who would be your dream actor or directing colleague to work with?Buster Keaton and Joan Littlewood.Hamilton or Hamlet?This is a naughty question because you’re asking me to choose between an apple and an orange. The obvious thing to do would be to choose both but I’m not going to do that. I’m going to say Hamlet‑ton. LO’KBorn in Sunderland to Egyptian parents, Tarek Iskander lived in Kuwait between the ages of five and 17, returning to England at the outbreak of the first Gulf war. His introduction to theatre came late. He was working as a management consultant at the NHS when, after accompanying his then partner to an audition, he ended up as an extra on Deborah Warner’s 2005 production of Julius Caesar at the Barbican. “Watching one of the best directors in the world, I thought: I could really do that,” he recalls.Iskander went on to co-found the Yard theatre in east London, where he directed two of his own plays including Qudz, “a show very close to my heart about Iraq and the Middle East”. He could only afford to quit his NHS job four years ago, going on to serve as interim director for theatre at Arts Council England. BAC, where he is now artistic director and chief executive, has been staging experimental theatre and testing out works in progress (what it refers to as “scratch” theatre) at its sprawling Victorian premises near Clapham Junction in south London since the 1970s. Iskander has been a regular there for years. “It was a place that always surprised me, where I could see the artists I was most excited about and never really knew what I was going to get,” he says.What three words sum up your theatre?Surprising, unpredictable, pioneering.What single thing would improve British theatre?Having more exchange and dialogue with international work. We are absolute leaders in some areas, such as inclusiveness and ersity, but we would benefit from further exchange, especially around artistic practice. It can come from anywhere – we’ve learned a lot by working with our colleagues in favelas in Brazil – but you have to engage with the world in order to benefit from that expertise.What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?Selina Thompson’s Salt has haunted me ever since I first saw it in Edinburgh, and it moved me deeply when I saw it again recently – it’s a remarkable piece of dialogue and conversation.Top three skills you need as an artistic director?You need to be open to possibilities wherever they arise, willing to make tough decisions when necessary, and engaged with what’s happening in the community around you.What can’t you live without at work?Caffeine. It starts with a cappuccino, then becomes really, really strong black coffee by late afternoon.What’s your favourite art form aside from theatre?Recently I’ve really started to get into dance, much more than previously, so I’m finding myself constantly going to dance performances.What books are on your bedside table?I’m reading quite a lot of David Mitchell – most recently Number9Dream, which I think is my favourite of his – and Ben Okri, his poems rather than his novels. Next up is Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel.Hamilton or Hamlet?Hamilton, because it’s fresh.Who would be your dream colleague?Benjamin Zephaniah, either performing or developing a piece of work, a story that we could really get our teeth into. I’m interested in his focus on ecology and vegetarianism.What should we come and see at your theatre?One by Bert and Nasi (30 September-19 October).

Somnium is the story of their romance and partnership – not the bit you might know from the tabloids (last year Katya was pictured snogging her Strictly partner Seann Walsh outside a London pub) but a tale of love, ambition and being proud to be different.Neil choreographs and directs the show, with music direction and costumes by Katya. It’s an easy watch, dashing by at swift pace with a cut-and-paste soundtrack of pop songs.The opening group scenes ooze with the pleasure of two bodies connecting, revelling in motion together, and there’s great chemistry between the Joneses. The inventive choreography pulls in influences from everywhere: contemporary, commercial, hip-hop, MC Hammer, even the floss, as well as jive and Latin – all shot through with punchy attitude.Actor Charles Venn narrates in detail, playing the couple’s former teacher. His self-regarding, plummy-toned delivery jars at times but it’s a useful device in that it leaves no work for the audience. There’s plenty of stage time for the excellent supporting dancers, including the whoop-inducing power moves of B-boy Chris Arias, but the best bits inevitably come from the leading couple. Neil in particular is a fantastic dancer, with a still strength at his core and energy whiplashing out from the centre. There’s a sense of heat building inside him, a heart-bursting swell, and he shows great swagger when partnering Katya, who is a dancer of clean, clean lines but molten in his arms.Somnium has a bit of everything: cheese, comedy, silliness, gimmicks (a UV routine!), an earnest message. Only a couple of scenes fall flat (the fey fashionistas feel like a bit of a throwback in these enlightened times). It’s quite slight, but packs in some great dancing, especially when the electricity erupts into fast, fierce group numbers. It is fun to see dance that goes all out to entertain, where the performers look like they’re having the time of their lives and really, really want you to feel the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a791ae81beee4fb57f028341c8d4e9494b86d0db/709_683_2002_1201/master/2002.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1666fdc81d25cdc3bf15829939c4408b","title":"send us a tip on enjoying lakes in the uk and europe for a chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Lakes can be quiet beauty spots, a hive of fun activities or great places for hiking, swimming and sailing.

Plus train reservationsThe sight of a gleaming railway snaking over an Alpine pass or hugging a lake has long inspired travellers, and both are well served by rail routes. This itinerary weaves from France through Switzerland to Austria, with spectacular views that will glue you to the train windows.At Lausanne, be sure to take an early morning dip at Plage de Pully, watching the sun rise over the Alps as you swim. Heading onwards, skirt Lake Geneva to the beautiful town of Annecy, and take the chance to paddle a canoe to La Cuillère à Omble, a restaurant at the lake’s southern end, serving local freshwater fish.Eastwards, at Chamonix, take the cable car to the top of the Aiguille du Midi for lunch at the self-service cafeteria of Le 3842 Restaurant, named for its lofty altitude. The journey onwards to Zermatt takes in magnificent scenery as the train hugs the mountainside. The stylish Swiss resort has wonderful hiking terrain, overlooked by the Matterhorn.At Lucerne, explore the cobbled alleys of the Kornmarkt and dine at the intimate, candlelit Grottino 1313 restaurant. From there, plunge onwards through the Arlberg valley to St Anton, home to some exhilarating ebike routes, after which you can take a deserved dip at the Arlberg Well spa. Continue east to lakeside Zell am See, where activities include paddleboarding, wakeboarding and waterskiing. Three times a week the free Magic Lake Show lights up the water.The route home stops at Innsbruck, with its space-age funicular and gondola to the top of the Nordkette, at 2,256 metres, with a jaw-dropping view. Explore the historic old town and the Imperial Palace, with its opulence of the Habsburg dynasty.Next, travel to Bern, whose old town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1983. The city is also home to the Einstein Museum. Thun makes for a scenic 20-minute side trip. Fast TGV and Eurostar trains will then speed you home.Journey times for all five itineraries can vary depending on date and time of departure. These recommendations are for faster connections, though not necessarily the fastest possible, and generally leaving in the morning on weekdays.

This itinerary widens the route, ning Barcelona and on through scenic French and Italian Riviera coastline to Rome, and then home via Switzerland.On your first evening, in Toulouse, admire the grand architecture of the Place du Capitole before drinking in the nightlife in the Carmes neighbourhood, starting at Chez Vincente bodega. From here there’s a choice of routes to Barcelona: a fast train via Perpignan or Narbonne, or the longer but much more scenic regional train via Latour-de-Carol with a change at the Spanish border (no reservations needed or available, three connecting trains each day). Between Latour-de-Carol and Toulouse, sit on the left to get the best views. Once in the Catalan capital, check out the Museu d’Història de Barcelona.

En route to Bergen, on the west coast, the train climbs to over 1,200 metres: you cross a mountain plateau called Hardangervidda and see waterfalls, cliffs and chasms. A sleeper takes you to Lillehammer, a pleasant lakeside town, and then it’s on to compact, wonderful Trondheim, founded in 977 AD. Take a boat trip to the island of Munkholmen – formerly a fort, monastery and second world war anti-aircraft gun station.Back into Sweden, pause for lakeside relaxation in Östersund and visit Jamtli, its historic open-air museum. A must-visit in Stockholm is the Vasa Museum, home of a ship salvaged in 1628 and majestically preserved. For hipster vibes, scoot over to Södermalm, an island within the city, and seek Bar Agrikultur in Nytorget.Speed back to Copenhagen and then on to Hamburg. Get up early for Altona fish market, which sells everything from sea creatures to fifth-hand junk – it’s a wholesome recovery after a big night out in the Reeperbahn district, perhaps.

European sleeper trains can cover vast distances overnight, so sleep to Ljubljana and wake up in a city whose grand central streets are beautifully car-free. Head up Ljubljana castle and then dine out at the Cankarjevo nabrežje, a riverside walkway lined with eateries.Your next train eastward is to Zagreb, with its beautiful Gornji Grad quarter, and Museum of Broken Relationships. Then sleep your way to Belgrade, a city brimming with culture and pedestrianised districts. Once in Niš, in southern Serbia, be sure to spend time at Holy Trinity cathedral, a curious mix of Byzantine, Islamic, Renaissance and baroque styles, replete with intricate frescoes.Onwards overnight into Bulgaria, via Sofia, you’ll alight at Plov, the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe. Eight thousand years after being founded, the city is 2019 European capital of culture. Don’t miss one of the best-preserved amphitheatres in the world.

The historic centre, Sultanahmet, is a fabulous stew of wonders, such as the glorious Blue Mosque, with its 260 stained-glass windows.On the return journey westwards, Veliko Târnovo in northern Bulgaria makes a good stop, not least for its wonderful handicraft market, Samovodska Charshiya. The train then heads north to Bucharest, home of the vast Palace of Parliament, the world’s largest legislative building.

This trip s eight countries – a massive dollop of European culture in one tour. Set out to reach Bordeaux before the sun sets, to celebrate the start of your trip with a glass and some charcuterie at wine bar La Ligne Rouge, overlooking the Garonne river, before an evening stroll along the Pont de Pierre, which was commissioned by Napoleon.Then it’s over the Spanish border to San Sebastián in the Basque country, for pintxos and the splendid seafront walk between La Concha and Ondarreta beaches. Next, venture south to Madrid, where restaurant Mercado de la Reina is the spot for generous portions of elaborate tapas. A fast AVE train will whisk you to Barcelona, to explore La Boqueria, the epic food market, and the architecture of the Gothic Quarter.Travel back over the border to Lyon, to stroll around the fountained Place des Jacobins and visit the Musée Miniature et Cinéma, a must for film lovers.In Turin, less than four hours away, cobbled Via Borga Dora has vintage clothes boutiques and a weekend flea market. Florence, spiritual – and physical – home of so much Renaissance art, needs no introduction. Tour wonders like the Duomo cathedral, and enjoy wine, pasta and other regional specialities at the Coquinarius restaurant.The comfortable NightJet sleeper train network connects Florence with pretty Salzburg. A network of ice caves 50km away in Werfen is a worthwhile jaunt.Prague, six hours’ ride to the north, is something of a Gothic fairytale. Check out picturesque park Petřínské Sady, Old Town Square and Prague Castle, which dates back to 870 AD.Travel overnight to Kraków, a city that – as well as epic historical sites – has a buzzing bar scene and hip hangouts such as Forum Przestrzenie on the banks of the Vistula. Further north, in Warsaw, admire the view over the city from the 30th floor of the Palace of Culture and Science.Time your overnight journey to Berlin to arrive on a Sunday, and head straight to Mauerpark for the bonkers outdoor karaoke – which attracts an audience of thousands from 3pm.At your final stop, Brussels, try the mussels at family-owned Chez Leon, and a final night out at Café Delirium, with its 2,004 beers.

Yes, that. What’s taking you so long?Perhaps you need to reply to an important-but-not-urgent work email, or pay an overdue utility bill. These tasks are straightforward enough, so why does alphabetising your books seem preferable instead?Procrastination is the pits. It leaves us feeling guilty and self-loathing. When contemplating, say, getting round to finally sorting out that life insurance quote that’s been on a Post-it note on the fridge for nine weeks, why does scrubbing the shower grouting with a toothbrush suddenly become more pressing?It cannot be that, as a species, we are inherently bone idle and appalling at managing our time, because the tasks we engage in rather than the ones we need to do often require focus and physical labour. In fact, laziness has very little to do with procrastination, which is, in simple terms, a form of self-punishment.Procrastination is not just about delaying. It is about engaging in something we know in our gut to be unhelpful – a painful level of self-awareness. We know that we’re avoiding what we need to do, which feels awful enough, but also that doing something else instead is not a great idea either. But we go ahead and do it anyway.The pattern is irrational. Yet when we start to consider how we feel, things become a little clearer. Procrastination is usually a habit rather than a one-off occurrence. It is unfair to label it as a character flaw (although it may be perceived as such by those close to us). Rather, it is an inability to manage uncomfortable feelings associated with a task.Particular jobs such as cleaning the toilet or unblocking the bath plughole are universally revolting because they involve matter we instinctively know could contaminate us. We’re wired to find them disgusting as a form of protection. However, deeper negative emotions – such as frustration, boredom, anxiety, resentment, confusion or insecurity – may be connected with other, less grimy tasks.If I am sitting in front of my computer trying to write a cover letter for a new job, I might start thinking: “I sound like a fool, they will surely think I sound terrible.” Replacing the task with something monotonous and engaging, such as vacuuming the stairs, is a way for me to cope with those difficult emotions.Research shows that procrastination can be explained as something we engage in as an urgent self-soothing technique, but the comfort is fleeting at best – once we start thinking about what we’re doing, more stress creeps in. There’s even a scientific name for this thought process: procrastinatory cognitions. In turn, this makes us procrastinate even more. We reward ourselves for procrastinating, while the negative emotions surrounding the task remain, as well as self-blame.Particular areas of our brain involved with self-perception interpret the tasks we’re procrastinating over as, essentially, not our problem – in the long-term, at least. As humans we aren’t wired to prioritise long-term needs. From an evolutionary perspective, we prioritise providing for ourselves in the present, because our ancestors never knew what was (or wasn’t) around the corner.So what can we do? Looking in the mirror and saying, “Stop procrastinating NOW” probably won’t work. Time management apps will only get you so far. Really, we need to think about the root cause of why we’re procrastinating. Identifying that it is about emotion rather than efficiency is a good start.Practically speaking, we can make our procrastination activities harder to do. If you habitually turn to social media, try deleting the apps from your phone and creating new, elaborate passwords. If you throw obstacles into the procrastination cycle, it takes longer to feel the reward and changes how your brain perceives the value of something – such as checking social media.Ultimately, loosening the grip of this existential habit comes down to self-compassion. Re-evaluate your tasks by creating a new “evidence base” for when you have done similar things well. Imagine the positive outcome. How will you feel in yourself? How will you – or others – benefit? Try writing that down. Presenting our inner dialogue to ourselves can be very powerful.Another potentially helpful technique is “defusion”. When the urge to procrastinate strikes, set an alarm for three minutes on your phone. Close your eyes. Bring your awareness to what is happening in your inner world – your thoughts about procrastinating (are they streams of words or images?) and the feelings in your body: where do you feel them? Are they familiar? Start noticing the way you’re interpreting what the thoughts and feelings around procrastination mean to you, and how that affects you in that moment. When the alarm goes, you may see your urge to escape your feelings for what it is.There is a robust evidence base to show that mindfulness exercises, if practised regularly, can improve our ability to accept and tolerate negative emotions without engaging in avoidance or actions that bring short-term relief. It might take a little time, but change is entirely possible. Your books can go unorganised for a while yet.For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27545df4a799ca5d58345fdcc6e134d6c5b400f6/0_72_5896_3537/master/5896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f885e0046d222324369e3d3b876017d","title":"chris boardman at odds with dft over zebra crossings in manchester","story":"Olympic champion told to shelve plans to paint simple crossings on 20,000 side streetsIt is a disagreement between two extremely determined opponents: one a gold medal-winning Olympian and the other a government department suspicious of attempts to challenge its road painting orthodoxy.Chris Boardman, the walking and cycling commissioner of Greater Manchester, wants to paint zebra crossings on 20,000 side streets in the region at a cost of £300 each. He believes the crossings – widespread across much of Europe as well as at supermarkets, stations and airports in the UK – will help pedestrians make local journeys more safely.But the Department for Transport (DfT) says he cannot, because under UK law zebra crossings have to be wired to the electric mains and have belisha beacons and zigzag markings, which cost £30,000.Boardman, who won gold in the velodrome at the 1992 Olympics, wants bargain zebras as an integral part of his “Bee Network” – a fully joined-up cycling and walking network covering 1,800 miles in Greater Manchester.He has estimated the cost of the network at £1.5bn but so far has been given only £160m, which he does not want to be eaten up buying belisha beacons.He argues that his crossings simply reinforce a little-known legal right of way for pedestrians when crossing side roads and that motorists would instinctively know to stop, belishas or not.“These crossings enforce a right that everybody has forgotten about,” Boardman told the Sunday Times. “The law is this: that when you put a foot on the carriageway, you have the right of way. But people don’t do it, because there is no point being in the right, while at the same time being in hospital after getting run over. I would like to see thousands of zebra crossings in Manchester.”A trial recently began, commissioned by Transport for Greater Manchester and conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, which Boardman hopes will prove his zebras are safe. Initial results suggest they make crossings safer for pedestrians and are therefore “legally robust and responsible”, he told the .Last year, the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) wrote to the DfT to recommend that the “traffic sign regulations and general directions” is updated to authorise the use of side road zebra crossings without the need for beacons or zigzag lines.“Crossing side road junctions in the UK is stressful. There is an assumption that turning traffic will not give way and will rarely indicate, so people must either grit their teeth and accept whatever fate brings them or move away from their desired line to a distance where they feel they could react quickly enough to avoid an approaching car. This issue is exacerbated for those with disabilities and those with small children,” the GMCA wrote.Last June, Boardman’s team painted an “implied zebra“ on a side road in Salford, supported by the local council. Officers monitored how the crossing was used and confirmed it worked, said Catriona Swanson, who was the borough’s cycling officer at the time. But the DfT ordered the council to paint over it after a few months, according to Brian Deegan, Boardman’s technical adviser.Implied zebras are already common on private property. There is one at Manchester’s main station, Piccadilly, which is owned by Network Rail. Last summer, the stripes were painted in rainbow colours to celebrate Pride, the LGBT festival.A DfT spokesman insisted the government was not at odds with Boardman and said: “Zebra crossings are designed to ensure the safety of all road users – beacons are necessary for visibility, while zigzag markings prevent parked cars blocking the view of pedestrians and cyclists.“We will always put safety first and any potential regulation change would need to be based on robust research and supported by off-road trials.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ef98cac882e51e4cbd91f1160e8c7182856c94/654_1451_2613_1568/master/2613.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d074a4120e31cd0506d7ca17d896c6","title":"communist party usa chicago cpusa convention","story":"In Chicago, an American party derided and feared for 100 years looked eagerly to a brighter futureAs the Communist party USA kicked off its 100th anniversary celebration, Jarvis Tyner called for delegates and guests at the national convention in Chicago to “set the record straight” about one of American politics biggest historical bogeymen.“The truth is the communist party isn’t out to hurt you,” Tyner, vice-chair of CPUSA and its candidate for vice-president in 1972 and 1976, told a large and erse crowd. “It will set you free.”The remarks, met with applause, came on the first day of CPUSA’s 31st national convention – and at a moment in American politics in which democratic socialism and progressive ideas are increasingly finding a home in the mainstream of the Democratic party.Communists from across the US, along with international delegates from Germany, Canada, Venezuela and elsewhere, sought to send the message that their party has been the most consistent champion of those ideas, has been on the right side of some of the most consequential ideological battles of the last hundred years, and is ready to continue the fight into its second century.“We are a party of action,” said Chicago activist Pepe Lozano in an opening address on Friday. His father, Rudy Lozano, was an aldermanic candidate in the city in the early 1980s who rallied Mexican and Puerto Rican voters to support Harold Washington, the first African-American mayor. The elder Lozano was shot dead in 1983 in what supporters say was an assassination.“We are united,” Lozano said. “We are determined. We are raring to fight.”Communism has long been regarded with fear in the US, viewed as antithetical to American values and democracy. The US spent much of the 20th century in battle against it, seeking to contain it in Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere, hot wars fought as part of the cold war with the Soviet Union.Decades were spent attempting to root out communism at home, including during the first red scare following the first world war and the second red scare of the 1940s and 1950s, in which Senator Joseph McCarthy led “investigations” to out suspected communists in government and public life. Accusations of communism, as well as socialism, continue to be leveled by conservatives against mainstream liberal politicians, including Barack Obama.But there is also a long history of communism and radical leftwing politics in America, as leaders and attendees pointed out in Chicago.“The story of our communist party is inextricably intertwined with the development of the American working class and building its labor movement,” Lozano said. “Our roots are in the profound American struggles for democracy.”Lozano cited party support for the civil rights and anti-war movements, for battles against police abuse and mass incarceration, and for drastic action to combat climate change including the Green New Deal proposed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the faces of the young democratic socialist movement within the Democratic party.To attend the CPUSA convention is in some ways to encounter familiar concerns and ideas. Attendees were animated by issues that 2020 presidential hopefuls have pushed to make part of the Democratic platform, including plans to address climate change, inequality and hawkish foreign policy – as well as opposition to Donald Trump, who has sought to “ide working people”, attendees said.“Our job as communists is to unite people,” Ismael Parra, from Los Angeles, told the .“We’re talking about people being joined together,” said Tere Gonzalez, also from LA.Mainstream liberals would have found other elements of the convention less familiar. In a student center on the campus of University of Illinois Chicago, in a large hall past a Dunkin Donuts and a PNC bank, attendees invariably greeted one another as “comrade”. A few wore apparel bearing a hammer and sickle.The convention began with the entire crowd enthusiastically singing This Land Is Your Land, Woody Guthrie’s classic folk song. And while even some of the most progressive mainstream politicians, Elizabeth Warren among them, have bristled at the “socialist” label, it can be striking to hear Americans openly discuss their support for communism.“Nobody is better at beating red-baiting than the reds,” Tyner joked, suggesting the Communist party could best defeat Republicans in 2020.While Tyner suggested during his speech that the party has differences with Ocasio-Cortez and others of the new wave of democratic socialists, that surge of progressive energy appeared to have emboldened the party and attracted new interest.People’s World, the news outlet affiliated with CPUSA, has seen increased readership this year, editor-in-chief John Wojcik and managing editor CJ Atkins told the convention. Several guests were not members of the party, but at the convention to learn more about it.Timothy Faye, who is not a communist but is interested in leftist causes, came to Chicago from Rhode Island. While many older Americans may have a negative view of communism, he said, younger people like him may be more open to its message.“There’s a leftward shift among young people,” Faye told the . “It’s a reflection of the economic environment people are in.”The party seems to see an opportunity to build.“Together, we will win,” Lozano said, concluding his speech. “Our victory is inevitable. Viva the Communist party USA!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900fa41ef8cfefe8ef7e28288f6544e817159ee0/0_583_4428_2657/master/4428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a473f4b2371cd5058b29cee2cabf14d3","title":"erdogan faces scrutiny once more as istanbul goes back to the polls","story":"Embarrassment for president as AKP lose Istanbul to CHP party’s Ekrem İmamoğluTurkey’s ruling party in Istanbul’s controversial mayoral election re-run has conceded defeat, handing the nation’s beleaguered opposition a victory that will have dramatic consequences for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s grip on the country.The ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) candidate and former prime minister Binali Yildirim admitted he had lost to the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) candidate Ekrem İmamoğlu in televised remarks just two-and-a-half hours after polls closed on Sunday evening, congratulating his rival and imploring him to serve Istanbul well.Sunday’s rerun, in which at least 10 million people were eligible to vote, was seen as a test for Turkey’s fragile democratic standards and Erdoğan’s political future.The swift concession by Yildirim, an Erdoğan ally, has saved the AKP the embarrassment of watching live results trickle in on Sunday night but will now lead to intensified power struggles between factions inside the ruling coalition.Turkey’s opposition, meanwhile, was jubilant at the initial results. Cars honked incessantly in liberal neighbourhoods and strangers shook hands and congratulated each other on the win. İmamoğlu’s voice echoed from public television screens and from inside cafes.İmamoğlu first stunned the country after a narrow win in local elections held on 31 March, a rare defeat and personal blow to Erdoğan in his beloved hometown.However, after weeks of AKP appeals, Turkey’s electoral board upheld one of the ruling party’s complaints regarding ballot counting and annulled İmamoğlu’s victory – a decision that sparked international outrage.“I’m not happy I’ve had to come vote again,” Aysun Coç, 53, said after casting her vote on Sunday morning. “İmamoğlu will win again with an even bigger margin this time. So what, they will make us do another vote next month?“The government will have to accept the result this time. If they don’t, we are ready to protest in a big way.”Yildirim, worked hard to close the gap of 13,000 votes, reaching out to the party’s base in working class and conservative neighbourhoods who punished the government for Turkey’s economic crisis by staying away from the voting booth in March.İmamoğlu, a previously anonymous local administrator was embraced by voters across the city in March for a platform that focused on bringing people together across the city’s highly polarised religious, class and ethnic ides.He painted his new campaign as a battle for the future of Turkish democracy itself.“Today our people will make the best decision … for the sake of our democracy, for Istanbul and also for the legitimacy of all future elections,” he told reporters after voting on Sunday morning.Erdoğan returned to his hometown from capital Ankara to cast his vote. “I believe the thinking voter will make the best decision for Istanbul,” he told hundreds of supporters who greeted him near his residence in Üsküdar, on the Asian side of the Bosphorus.“If İmamoğlu wins again, there’s going to be a chain of serious changes in Turkish politics,” journalist and writer Murat Yetkin told Reuters earlier on Sunday.“It will be interpreted as the beginning of a decline for AKP and for Erdoğan as well,” he added, noting that the president himself had called the local elections “a matter of survival”.Rumours are already circulating in political circles that the second defeat could trigger a snap national election as Erdoğan seeks to oust increasingly fractious elements in his current government coalition.Former president Abdullah Gül, who has been openly critical of the decision to rerun Istanbul’s mayoral election, caused a stir on Sunday by telling reporters “God willing everything will be fine”. The phrase’s similarity to İmamoğlu’s slogan – “Everything will be fine” – led to speculation the former Erdogan ally had cast his ballot for İmamoğlu.Across the city on Sunday, both AKP and CHP voters were united in their desire to avoid further political turmoil after polls closed at 5pm.“Clearly there is some funny business going on here but I don’t know what,” aid 65-year-old AKP voter Cihat Içyumaz, who, like many Istanbullus, cut short his summer holiday to come home and vote.“For me, chaos after this round of elections is the scariest outcome. I just want the candidate who is best for Istanbul to win.”Preliminary results are expected late on Sunday evening, but official results could still be delayed several days as cross-party officials painstakingly monitor the vote counting process.After heavy criticism of official news agency Anadolu’s handling of the 31 March election results – during which the live TV feed stopped several times as the opposition began to make gains – private ANKA news agency and Fox TV in Turkey announced they will also broadcast the live vote count.The Council of Europe, a France-based human rights organisation, deployed a team of monitors across Istanbul to observe Sunday’s election.Additional reporting by Gökçe Saraçoğlu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a61c4168e97a66454186863808e7fe43acb754c/0_446_5944_3567/master/5944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94c21db4f08a1856bb79534bab69fe60","title":"paris prepares pools parks and cool rooms for predicted heatwave","story":"French capital still carries trauma of 2003 heatwave, when morgues ran out of spaceParis pools will host night swimming, large parks will stay open all hours and special “cool rooms” will be set up in town hall buildings as French authorities fear for residents’ health during the anticipated European heatwave.The French capital still carries the trauma of the 2003 heatwave, which caused many thousands of deaths in France and so many deaths in the Paris area that morgues ran out of space.Elderly people and those living alone without contact with neighbours are a particular concern as the city increases emergency planning. There will be special phonelines, and “cool rooms” will be available between 2pm and 6pm across the capital.The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said on Sunday that as many as eight major swimming pools would stay open after 10pm and swimming would be allowed in the canal basin at La Villette. She also said three temporary outdoor pools would be set up for in highly populated, lower-income areas of the city, which would be free to use.Paris has relatively little green space and has been working for years on how to “green up” and introduce more plants in order to counter the heat held by stone and concrete. Hidalgo told the Journal du Dimanche that 13 large parks would stay open all night during the anticipated heatwave because the temperature there would be one or two degrees lower than in the rest of the city. She said five more parks would be added if the heatwave continued.The city’s growing homeless population, which includes high numbers of migrants who sleep rough in groups of tents under bridges or by roads, is also a particular concern. Hidalgo said 5,000 reusable flasks of water would be distributed to people living on the street, and more than 1,000 drinking fountains added across the city. Aid workers would increase their rounds of the city to check on rough sleepers, she said.The homeless help centre at La Chapelle, an area with large numbers of undocumented migrants and refugees sleeping rough, “would stay open seven days a week, with a capacity for 400 showers a day”, she said. Campaigners have long complained that not enough year-round support is available for the city’s homeless.Hospital emergency rooms in Paris are braced for an increase of patients just as many have led strike action over insufficient resources."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Rain comes as Europe is set to experience a potentially record-breaking heatwaveSecond person injured and rally is cancelled after incident on the Fanad Head loopArrests made for public order, misuse of drugs, and dangerous driving offencesTessie Carroll leaves \u0026lsquothe Tuggers\u0026rsquo market after 60 years selling clothes and bric-a-bracDublin City Council has put forward a plan for a \u0026euro10m traffic-free College Green plazaMan dies after vehicle set alight in incident with a truck near Clogh on the M11Legislation to limit payments placed producers at competitive disadvantage \u0026ndash unionBritish chef in Spanish court over alleged murder of Irish father-of-two John PenderGreenway along old railway could attract up to 250,000 visitors and boost local tourismVictim was targeted by man on Facebook and believed relationship had developedSeizure of almost 40kgs of cannabis herb is biggest drugs find in Cork so far this yearThree men from ages 28 to 49 and 28-year-old woman arrested in LisburnAnthony Moynihan (54), detained on foot of bench warrant, given 7-year sentenceResidents in Clontarf evacuated as Army bomb disposal unit called to sceneFishermen moved from harbour in 2008 due to redevelopment seek return to facilitiesPostmortem due on 57-year-old man, believed to be retired gardaNumber of penalty points issued for speeding dropped nationally over three-year periodMan in his 30s remains in custody over killing of 56-year-old William Delaney"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3934928.1561299339!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"college green traffic ban for three summer sundays to test plaza plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA architect’s image of the proposed College Green plaza.College Green in Dublin city centre will be traffic-free for three days this summer, the business representative group Dublin Chamber has confirmed. In a tweet it said College Green, the area in front of the Bank of Ireland would be pedestrianised on Sunday July 21st, Sunday July 28th and Sunday August 4th. The aim is to test the popularity of a car free plaza at College Green. A programme of family events are planned on these days to encourage people into the city centre. The council is expected to reapply for permission for the plaza in the coming months. The board last November rejected the pedestrian and cycle plaza scheme due to concerns about the “significantly negative impacts” it would have on bus transport and traffic in the city.The council intends to lodge a fresh application to the board by the middle of this year. However, its head of traffic management Brendan O’Brien said it was unlikely the plaza proposals would change.“An Bord Pleanála themselves in their judgment, and in the inspectors report, found the plaza was a good idea. Architecturally there were no real issues with it,” he said. “The issues were the knock-on consequences of the plaza rather than anything to do with the plaza itself.”In its ruling last November the board said “the principle of the proposed development is acceptable” and that it would produce a “quality public realm” and would “facilitate improved appreciation of the architectural and cultural heritage of this important site”.However, it would not give permission because of the traffic implications for the city, particularly on buses.The board said there was “uncertainty” about the potential effects on the bus system, but they were likely to be “significantly negative in the light of the scale of rerouting of buses proposed, the critical importance of bus transport to the city, and its future role in facilitating modal shift from public car usage, in line with national policy”.It criticised the traffic analysis done by the council and was not satisfied it was “sufficient to accurately quantify the traffic impacts of the proposed development and the magnitude of those impacts”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3934942.1561304561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to impose new sanctions on iran as early as monday","story":"Iranian politicians chanted Death to America! during a parliament session on Sunday, June 23rd amid escalating tension with Washington following the downing of an unmanned US drone. Video: ReutersThe United States will unveil new sanctions on Iran as early as Monday, US national security adviser John Bolton has said, warning that Iran should not “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.Speaking alongside Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu during a visit to Israel, Mr Bolton noted that President Donald Trump had just stopped the strikes from taking place “at this time”.“As President Trump said on Friday our military is rebuilt, new and ready to go,” he said.Mr Bolton was speaking days after Mr Trump abruptly called off planned air strikes on Iranian targets that had been planned as retaliation for a shooting-down of a US naval drone in the Persian Gulf region last week. US media also reported that the US launched a cyberattack on Iran’s weapons systems on Thursday, disabling the computer systems that control missile launchers though there was no confirmation from the White House.Mr Bolton’s comments in Tel Aviv were seen in part as efforts to reassure US allies in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, that the United States will remain tough on Iran, despite aborting a planned air strike. His threat of new sanctions echoed warnings from Mr Trump over the weekend that new sanctions were imminent.Mr Netanyahu said he welcomed the prospect of further economic pressure on Iran, adding that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal had only served to give the country more cash, arguing that “tens of billions of dollars” had poured into Iran’s coffers.Mr Trump was asked on Saturday as he left the White House for Camp David if he still had confidence in Mr Bolton, who is well-known to have hawkish views on Iran and previously advocated regime change. “I do,” he replied. “John Bolton is doing a very good job but he takes generally a tough posture,” he said, adding: “ultimately I make the decision”.Mr Trump warned in an interview with NBC that war with Iran would be “obliteration like you’ve never seen before.” But he struck a more conciliatory tone in his comments to journalists on Saturday as he departed for Camp David, claiming that he could help “make Iran great again” if Tehran co-operates.NegotiationsMr Trump suggested that he could be open to negotiations with Iran. “We’ll start all over. We could have a deal with them very quickly. It’s up to them,” he said. He dismissed the 2015 nuclear deal struck by president Barack Obama and other international powers, arguing that it would have allowed Iran to legally build a weapon in a number of years and did not allow full inspection rights.“We’re not going to have Iran have a nuclear weapon. When they agree to that, they’re going to have a wealthy country. They’re going to be so happy, and I’m going to be their best friend. I hope that happens . . . but it may not.”He said that, as a New Yorker, he knows a lot of Iranians, describing them as “very smart, very ambitious”.“I come from New York City. We have a lot of Iranians and they’re great people,” he said. “I have many friends who are Iranians. I don’t want to kill 150 Iranians,” he added, referring to his decision not to sanction military strikes on Iran after he was advised that 150 people might be killed. He again defended that decision, repeating his view that a military strike would have been disproportionate to the shooting-down of an unmanned US drone.“We want to be proportionate. We’re getting lot of praise for what I did,” he said. “We have plenty of time, we have plenty of time.”He also said that Iran was wise not to shoot down an American aircraft carrying passengers, following claims from Tehran that it refrained from shooting down a second aircraft last week.The president also dismissed suggestions that the ongoing standoff between Washington and Tehran was about oil and keeping access to the Straits of Hormuz, a key thoroughfare for oil tankers.“We are the number one oil producer – oil and gas – in the world by far,” he said. “We don’t really need the straits anymore. The biggest beneficiary of the straits is China. Ninety-one per cent of their energy comes out of the straits,” he said, adding that Japan and Indonesia also benefit. “We are doing them a very big service.”The UN Security Council which includes China and Russia as members, is expected to discuss Iran on Monday at the request of the US. Mr Bolton is also due to meet with Russian officials to discuss the situation in the Middle East, including in Syria."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeJihadi Jack feels \u0026#39guilty\u0026#39 for his parents\u0026#39 convictionBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionJeremy Hunt woos Scottish Tories with visit to 99-year-old great-aunt and pledge to stop indy ref twoCharity watchdog investigating claims of sex cover up by charity run by new Oxfam boss Environmentalist who removed tonnes of plastic from beaches quits, saying we\u0026#39re \u0026#34losing the battle\u0026#34 Comment: We all love a character in politics – that\u0026#39s why, despite his transgressions, Boris is still the frontrunnerJeremy Hunt: Boris Johnson could disappoint people very quickly if he gets into Number 10GP who \u0026#34involves his Christian faith\u0026#34 with patient consultations investigated by by medical watchdogBoris Johnson is warned of \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 after polls suggest gap closing - as Jeremy Hunt ally calls on frontrunner to \u0026#39explain\u0026#39 flat rowTwo men targeted in an “appalling” homophobic knife attack by young boys as charities call for \u0026#34action\u0026#34Nasa\u0026#39s Curiosity rover detects methane in latest hint at life on Mars Watch: Terrifying cliff ing championships held on stunning island in the AzoresUS \u0026#39conducted cyber attacks on Iran\u0026#39 in response to drone downingEthiopia foils coup attempt after military chief shot dead by bodyguard in his homeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this. You\u0027d say I\u0027m insane.  Letts faces being barred from returning to the UK under rules that allow Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, to strip him of his citizenship provided it would not make him stateless.   I\u0027ve repented from what I did, and it\u0027s not important in a sort of legal sense, but that\u0027s why I left. I realized what I did was wrong, religiously and also in a moral sense, he added.There\u0027s a feeling of stress and there\u0027s a feeling of regret.

usually by someone who grew up in them - is the top most preference of tourists who visit the countryDharavi, which is the largest slum of Asia, won the top position on the Top 10 Experiences list in India and also made it to the \u002710 Travellers’ Choice Experiences 2019 in Asia\u0027 list.Slum tours around the world have become more and more popular in recent years and are the source of much discussion over their ethics.Critics claim they are exploitative and poor areas are even cleared out or ‘sanitised’ by police before tourists visit, meaning those who live in these areas are forced to go along.Proponents however say any responsible tour is carried out by proud residents who show that their home is more than a slum and promote the enterprise and ingenuity within them.Dharavi for instance recycles much of Mumbai’s waste plastic and paper, and is home to various craft industries - meaning tourists can contribute to an economy far away from the temples and palaces on the usual visitor trail.While Dharavi topped the list for the experiences in India, it was followed by a \u0027bike tour of Old Delhi\u0027 and a \u0027private day tour of Taj Mahal and Agra Fort by a superfast train\u0027 on the second and third position respectively.On the Asia list, Dharav, which is home to more than 1m people and featured in the film Slumdog Millionaire, bagged the 10th rank after \u0027full-day group Angkor Wat Tour from Siem Reap in Cambodia\u0027 and enjoying the \u0027Krabi Sunset Cruises at Ao Nang, Thailand\u0027.In the Asia list, while the \u0027Ubud tour with Jungle Swing in Indonesia\u0027 bagged the top position, the \u0027faster than skip-the-line experience at the Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St. Peter’s Basilica Tour in Rome, Italy\u0027 topped the World category.Boris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionJeremy Hunt woos Scottish Tories with visit to 99-year-old great-aunt and pledge to stop indy ref twoCharity watchdog investigating claims of sex cover up by charity run by new Oxfam boss Environmentalist who removed tonnes of plastic from beaches quits, saying we\u0026#39re \u0026#34losing the battle\u0026#34 Comment: We all love a character in politics – that\u0026#39s why, despite his transgressions, Boris is still the frontrunnerJeremy Hunt: Boris Johnson could disappoint people very quickly if he gets into Number 10GP who \u0026#34involves his Christian faith\u0026#34 with patient consultations investigated by by medical watchdogBoris Johnson is warned of \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 after polls suggest gap closing -

The detection of methane hints at an even greater discovery - life on Mars - as the gas is often generated by microbes underground known as methanogens,which can survive without oxygen.Given this surprising result, we’ve reorganized the weekend to run a follow-up experiment,  wrote scientist Ashwin R. Vasavada  in the email published by the New York Times.It is not the first time Nasa\u0027s robot has detected methane levels on the planet, and scientists are still not sure whether the gas is caused by living microbes. This is because geothermal reactions, with no biological life involved, can also create methane. When Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 it could find barely any traces of methane, with less than one part per billion in the atmosphere. Then in 2013 the rover detected a sudden increase in methane levels, with seven parts methane per billion, which endured for several months and then vanished. The most recent discovery of Methane is 21 parts per billion, three times higher than the spike in 2013. Scientists are also not ruling out the possibility that the methane was not recent, having been trapped underground for millions of years, and only now is gradually emerging through cracks in the surface. Thomas Zurbuchen, from Nasa\u0027s science mission directorate, advised people not to jump to any conclusions about the methane detection in a message on Twitter. While increased methane levels measured by Mars Curiosity are exciting, as possible indicators for life, it\u0027s important to remember this is an early science result, he wrote. To maintain scientific integrity, the science team will continue to analyse the data before confirming results.Jihadi Jack feels \u0026#39guilty\u0026#39 for his parents\u0026#39 convictionBoris Johnson v Jeremy Hunt: Tory leadership candidates\u0026#39 Brexit views, policies, team and key supporters comparedCzechs turn out for biggest protests since the end of Communism Erdogan\u0026#39s party loses controversial re-run of Istanbul electionJeremy Hunt woos Scottish Tories with visit to 99-year-old great-aunt and pledge to stop indy ref twoCharity watchdog investigating claims of sex cover up by charity run by new Oxfam boss Environmentalist who removed tonnes of plastic from beaches quits, saying we\u0026#39re \u0026#34losing the battle\u0026#34 Comment: We all love a character in politics – that\u0026#39s why, despite his transgressions, Boris is still the frontrunnerJeremy Hunt: Boris Johnson could disappoint people very quickly if he gets into Number 10GP who \u0026#34involves his Christian faith\u0026#34 with patient consultations investigated by by medical watchdogBoris Johnson is warned of \u0026#39complacency\u0026#39 after polls suggest gap closing -

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s just done so again.People who want a second vote on Brexit should go and live in North Korea, he said. Meaning that they had no time for democracy.Gallagher — like almost every bloody pop musician — backed Remain in the ­referendum. But he said: “There’s only one f***ing thing worse than a fool who voted for Brexit. That’s the rise of the c***s trying to get the vote overturned.”His message, then, to the relentlessly moaning Remainers who have tried every trick in the book to get that democratic decision overturned is: Don’t look back in anger — get on with your lives and let Brexit happen.As we decided it must.And here’s the thing. I suspect most Remainers think exactly the same. The people I know who voted Remain were saddened by the referendum result and they wished we’d all voted dferently.But they all believe that the vote must be upheld. And there should not be a second vote.And when I talk to them, they don’t call me a Nazi or a fascist for voting Leave.They don’t suggest I’m too thick to be allowed to vote or that I hate all foreigners.They just agree to dfer on that simple issue of in or out, and there’s no bad ­feeling at all.This is the thing. The politicians and commentators insist Brexit has ­brutally ided the nation. That the wounds will take a long time to heal. That we’re all at each other’s throats. The .million versus the .million.It’s not so at all. The only real ide is between the four or five million Remain voters who simply won’t have it — and the rest of the country.A lot has been written about the people who voted Leave — most of it codswallop.“It was just the poor and the left-behind, the uneducated and the ­xenophobes.”The statistics simply don’t bear that out.People of all walks of le, all levels of education, all ages and all ­backgrounds voted Leave.This is not, however, true of that hardcore of Remainers, between a quarter and a third of that million, who demand we run the vote again.They are insulated from the normal world. When they say they don’t know anyone who voted Leave, they’re telling the truth.They work in professions where ­virtually nobody voted Leave.In our ­universities , in schools , and among luvviesand scientists .And the BBC — I don’t have figures for the BBC but I would guess it’s close to  per cent for Remain.This is the real ide. Between a ­liberal middle-class elite who simply do not understand the hopes and aspirations of the rest of us. And react with absolute fury when they don’t get their own way.When Brexit is over, one way or another, that liberal elite will still be with us, utterly out of touch with the rest of the country.That’s the ide that matters today. A small minority determined to inflict their liberal policies upon the rest of us.THE BBC shoved an imam from Gloucester on to its Tory leadership debate programme and has now had to apologise.Abdullah Patel asked questions of the candidates about anti-Muslim bigotry in their party. Turns out he’s been accused of plenty of bigotry himself.A whole bunch of social media posts from Patel attacking Israel and praising Corbyn were uncovered. There were “Zionists” hiding behind the Holocaust, a suggestion that Israel should be transported to the centre of the US and so on. The usual stuff.None of it surprised me – and he’s not alone in pushing this view. Is it any wonder anti-semitism is now so entrenched in the Labour Party, and in our country Bob lived in Zimbabwe. Bob was standing in the middle of a road at night when a car hit him.The car cartwheeled, killing both of the people in it. They were rhino-horn smugglers – scumbags who kill rhinos so the valuable horns can be sold in powder form to sad Chinese men who can’t get a stfy.Anyway, Bob’s now dead. But his le was not given in vain.Thank you, Bob.THE latest social media trend is the bubble-tea selfie. Japanese girls take photos of themselves with a carton of the sugary drink nestled between their baps.Nope, I don’t know why.The craze is spreading west, too.People have been seen doing it in Thailand and Vietnam.Will it reach here Well, it’s got to navigate its way through Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia – so I wouldn’t bet on it.THE Breakthrough Listen Project was a massive scheme using millions of computers.It was dedicated to finding intelligent extra-terrestrial le. It has found . . . nothing. Just light year after light year of utter silence.I think it’s time we accustomed ourselves to the fact there’s nothing out there and we’re all alone. The rest of the universe is cold, silent and devoid of intelligent le. Just like Canada.IT’S a shame to see Rory Stewart crashing out of the Conservative leadership race.Not because I agree with him about anything – I don’t. I’d just thought it was high time we had a PM whose real Christian name is Roderick.If people called Roderick ran the country we wouldn’t be in the mess we are now.Sure, Mr Stewart doesn’t use “Roderick”.He’s shortened it to “Rory” in order to sound more dashing and maybe a bit Celtic. Big mistake.Be proud of your given Christian name, Roderick Stewart. It means great ruler. Rory, I think, just means drunk Glaswegian eating a pie.THE bigger and richer charities get, the less likely they are to do the job they were set up to do. The RSPB is a case in point.It’s very rich indeed, with mugs like me paying for its upkeep each month.Incredibly, this organisation has flogged part of a crucial nature reserve near Middlesbrough – so a huge power station can be built on it. What possible right do they have to do that The RSPB says the Saltholme reserve is not one of high ecological signicance. But it was home to some of the UK’s most endangered birds. Not for much longer. At least the RSPB made a fast buck.HAVE you seen Joe Hart’s new tattoo  Christ help us all.It looks like half his torso has been draped in a torn bin liner.Joe doesn’t care what other people think of it – fair enough.But remembering his performances in goal for England, I wondera dferent sort of tattoo might have been more helpful. On one wrist the words: “Stand in the centre of the goal when facing a free kick, you idiot.” And on the other: “Have a go at catching the ball from time to time.”THE oldest woman in Europe has died at the age of .Italian Giuseppina Robucci credited her long, long le to avoiding alcohol.A week ago, however, the oldest woman in the UK died.

It will be a shiny new global currency for the st Century, taking on the dollar and the Pound.But I’m not fooled. I think we all know what Facebook is really up to.This is yet another way to harvest data about our financial habits which it can then use for targeted marketing. Critics are already calling it the “most invasive and dangerous form of surveillance ever designed”.Collecting and exploiting information about us is, after all, the whole reason for the company’s existence.Years ago it was basic stuff, like quizzes asking, “What kind of personality type are you ”Fill that in and you are practically begging to be ­targeted in marketing and ­political campaigns. But handing over our spending details is quite another matter.This may be spun as ­connecting the world and ­revolutionising payments but it is really all about tapping the modern-day version of oil — the wells of data.Facebook already knows who you are. Accept Libra and it will know what you are buying, who you’re paying and how much you have.Will it be regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority, as banks are in this country  Certainly, the company has not shown much desire for regulation so far — of which more later.But what do we know about how trustworthy, secure or morally sound this would-be money broker is The Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data from million users was shared with political consultants, led to a fine of £, by ­Britain’s Information ­Commissioner’s Office.Last September the company admitted that data from million of its users had leaked due to a security flaw.In  it failed to stop the live broadcast of the torture of a disabled man in Chicago. It has also refused to take down neo-Nazi content.Facebook is under criminal investigation by US prosecutors who are looking into data-sharing deals with, among other, Amazon and Apple. It has been caught out farming data from apps whose users might have been unaware they were feeding information to Facebook.The company was found to be harvesting the dates of female users’ periods via an app which tracked ovulation.Facebook has also been accused of doing little to protect ­vulnerable children from ­promotions of self-harm. British father Ian Russell has directly linked Facebook-owned Instagram to the suicide of his -year-old daughter, Molly.Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg refused to attend the UK ­Parliament’s committee on ­disinformation and “fake news” last year, amid concern the social media giant is ­positioning itself as a news publisher but without ­compliance with any of the regulation or laws governing traditional journalism.The  has been blamed for spreading hatred. In March this year an ­Australian white supremacist live-streamed on Facebook his massacre of  people at two New Zealand mosques.It has further been accused of putting IS terrorists in touch with each other via its “suggested friends” application.When challenged as to why it does not do more to tackle ­terrorism, it falls back on the explanation that it does not have the technology to watch what its .billion users are doing all the time.Yet somehow that does not seem to stop it farming commercially valuable data from our accounts.The same will no doubt turn out to be true about Libra. This week French finance ­minister Bruno Le Maire warned that the cryptocurrency would inevitably be used by terrorists and criminals to sht money around undetected.When it happens, Facebook will no doubt shrug its corporate shoulders once more and say it is powerless to stop it.In theory, the very complex nature of cryptocurrencies means that it should be near impossible for anyone to steal our money.But we have all heard the horror stories. The best-known cryptocurrency, ­Bitcoin, ­at first soared in value, ­making millions for people who latched on to it early. But  months ago it crashed.Of course, most of us like to shop on the internet — and e-commerce is only likely to grow in the coming years.But most of us do it with our bank cards or direct from accounts which hold our money in a ­currency which is backed by the central bank of a First World country.This means we can be ­reasonably sure the currency won’t ­suddenly disappear or become valueless. It is quite another matter doing business in a currency that is backed by internet firms.How can we be sure that Facebook will still be around in a few years’ time Of course, banks sometimes go bust, but at least we have some protection in the form of the Government’s financial services compensation scheme which will refund up to £, of savings in the event of a failure.Facebook claims Libra will be backed by an independent foundation in Switzerland and will be free from the kind of speculation that drove the value of Bitcoin, because its value will be linked to a basket of currencies.But I’m sorry, I’m just not buying it. I’m sticking with sterling when I do my online shopping.It might not be very exciting but I feel confident it will still be around well when Libra, and Facebook, have long ago ­disappeared. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them.

Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t think the public are concerned about things like that.He served eight years as London Mayor.

Former Tory PR guru Ms Symonds, , has been in a relationship with the Tory Party leadership candidate since last year, when he left second we Marina Wheeler. Police were called to the home she shares with Johnson, , who is favourite to become the next Prime Minister, after reports of screaming and loud bangs. Now her ex, Oliver Haiste, has described their relationship as tumultuous - and said it was full of ups and downs. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he said relationships with Ms Symonds can be intense and passionate, but added: That passion can work the other way when she is not happy with you.    Mr Haiste, who was with her for three years, said it was fantastic when times were good, but awful when they werenapost. He stated: Any relationship with Carrie or friendship with Carrie is very intense and can often burn brightly. The pair met in  through a mutual friend, and enjoyed holidays to Rome and Kenya together during their relationship. Mr Haiste said: Itaposs the most up and down relationship I have had. He told the Mail on Sunday that it came to an upsetting and not particularly amicable end, but did not elaborate. The twice-married politician has has a string of high-profile affairs during his time in the public eye. Would-be PM Mr Johnson has been in a relationship with Ms Symonds since last year.    The former London Mayor is locked in a orce with second we Marina Wheeler. In September last year the pair released a statement confirming their orce plans, after  years of marriage. During his time in journalism and public office, Mr Johnson had at least four extra-marital affairs and is claimed to have made at least two of his mistresses pregnant. He married his first we, university sweetheart Allegra Mostyn-Owen, in . They orced after he had an affair with childhood friend Marina, whom he wed in . In , he admitted having an affair with writer Petronella Wyatt while both worked on the magazine The Spectator. Her mother later claimed she had a miscarriage and an abortion by Mr Johnson.  In , Boris fathered a love child with art consultant Helen Macintyre, then  while he was married. He was forced to admit the existence of the child in a court case after a judge ruled it was in the public interest.  Mr Johnson was yesterday confirmed as in the final running to lead the UK after PM Theresa May stepped aside. He will face Jeremy Hunt in a leadership contest. The Brexiteer has led the votes among Tory party members during the leadership race, and is widely tipped as most likely to get the keys to number . Johnson remains under pressure to answer questions about police being called to his partneraposs home, with a Conservative grandee accusing him of a lack of judgment over his refusal to comment on the incident.  The leadership favourite declined to explain to Tory grassroots what went on at the south London flat in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the party faithful did not want to hear about that kind of thing. A poll carried out after the reports emerged suggested Mr Johnsonaposs support among Tory voters had dropped by more than half, while among the general electorate it indicated he had slipped into second place behind rival Jeremy Hunt. The Foreign Secretary ramped up his challenge to Mr Johnson on Saturday, saying in an open letter that their character was being tested in the final stage of the leadership race and scrutiny can be uncomfortable. Tory grandee Sir Malcolm Rkind told BBC Radio  Live: If you are a candidate to be prime minister and the police have been called to your house - fairly or unfairly - the fact is there was a police visit.

Footage reveals Steve Bannon, a former aide to Donald Trump, claiming he had talked to the Tory MP all weekend and gone back and forth on text after Mr Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in July last year. The hard-right provocateur alleged he gave the MP recommendations, including to echo his language from the  EU referendum, and even complimented his book on Winston Churchill.A source close to Boris Johnson today rejected any suggestion heaposd taken advice from Bannon as totally preposterous to the point of conspiracy.But the footage raised questions over the nature of his contact with Bannon, who edited far-right website Breitbart and is a vocal supporter of Nigel Farage, Tommy Robinson and French right-wing leader Marine Le Pen. Last year Bannon told the annual conference of Le Penaposs former party, the National Front: “Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour.”    Mr Johnson previously said his so-called association with Steve Bannon was a lefty delusion whose spores continue to breed in the Twittersphere. He wrote in April this year: I met Mr Bannon a couple of times when I was foreign secretary and he was Trump’s chief of staff. But not since. But itaposs now understood Mr Johnson did exchange texts with Mr Bannon around the time he resigned as Foreign Secretary. An ally said Mr Johnson was simply being polite because of his previous diplomatic relationship with Bannon. A source close to Mr Johnson insisted: Any suggestion that Boris is colluding with or taking advice from Mr Bannon or Nigel Farage is totally preposterous to the point of conspiracy. But Labour MP David Lammy said: When I called out Boris Johnsonaposs links with hard right, white supremacist Steve Bannon in April, Johnson branded it a Lefty delusion. Here is proof on tape. Steve Bannon helped write your resignation speech. You are a pathological liar, unfit to serve. Bannon left Donald Trumpaposs White House in August  and it is thought he texted Mr Johnson last summer asking for a meeting, which was declined.    Film-maker Alison Klayman captured Bannon talking about Mr Johnson in July  while reading a copy of the Daily . In the footage, handed to The Observer, Bannon said: I’ve been talking to him all weekend about this speech. We went back and forth over the text. Asked how he had contacted Mr Johnson, the US strategist replied: “Went back and forth over text, itaposs just easier. I talked to him initially on the phone then it’s just easier to go back and forth on text. He added one of my recommendations was for Mr Johnson to repeat his final arguments of the  referendum, that June  would be Independence Day. All I was telling him all weekend was just to incorporate those themes, the same themes, Bannon said.  A source close to Mr Johnson today once again insisted he had not met or spoken to Bannon since Bannon left his role in the White House. Bannon has been accused of overstating his influence on EU politics. He was confronted by Axios earlier this month over claims he would offer expertise and campaign war rooms to European populist parties. He admitted: We got our lawyers involved and with election laws in Europe Iaposm not so sure we can actually provide that. He also claimed he had given Italyaposs deputy PM Matteo Salvini a lot of overall advice before admitting they had only spoken maybe three or four times.

I was in Tampa with friends when I heard folk music coming from an Irish and Scottish bar, The Harp  Thistle. I liked the music, so I went in. There one night, I met this beautul, lively woman named Linda. We started dating and I soon learned she was heavily involved with Noraid, the US political wing of the Provisional IRA. I didn’t know much about the Northern Ireland conflict, but feigned interest because I liked Linda. She invited me to Ireland and I accepted. We drove up to Sligo and Donegal on the west coast – Linda knew the owners of pro-IRA bars and they all knew her by her first name.    One of the owners, Joe O’Neill, was a long-time IRA man and he took a liking to me and taught me about Irish history. Linda and I broke up soon afterwards, but I was hooked on Ireland by then and went back by myself to meet Joe and other IRA men.I didn’t know it at the time, but the Irish police were photographing me with IRA members and sent the photos to the FBI.One day an FBI agent showed up at my trucking company office. I said I didn’t know about anything illegal, which was the truth, but he insisted on coming back to ask questions. He then said the FBI would pay for me and my new girlfriend, Maureen, to fly to Ireland when we wanted, in exchange for small pieces of information about the IRA.    As I didn’t know anything, I felt I might as well let the FBI pay for our holidays. So we would go back and forth to Ireland and give the FBI very little. Then one day, Joe invited me to the room he used for IRA meetings, which was above his pub. He said he wanted me to smuggle explosive parts from the US, and gave me the address of a primary school where I should send them – the plastic explosives were to be hidden in teddy bears, detonating cord disguised as skipping rope, and electronic parts hidden in radios. This made me flinch – the idea of sending explosives to a school. I said I would, but I passed on the info to the FBI, and soon the spying operation became more serious. I wanted to move to Ireland anyway, and the FBI agreed to pay for the lease on a pub on the Irish border, near Joe’s bar. My bar quickly became a gathering point for IRA members and the information started to come in.  I liked the customers, but some moments shocked me – like watching a granny bouncing a young boy on her knee and telling him some day he would shoot policemen in the North. Pretty soon the FBI asked me to meet MI, which was keen to have spies in the IRA groups that were opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process. I flew to London for a debrief with an MI agent, and soon I was reporting to them as well. Then, in August , the Real IRA set off a car bomb in Omagh, which killed  civilians, including a mother nine months pregnant with twins. Later, Maureen and I watched a documentary about children injured in the Omagh bomb, one of whom was blinded. It was devastating.  I had to remind myself these were the people I was dealing with. There was a tendency to see them as friends, but I also had to find those other feelings at the back of that – revulsion and disgust for what was happening to innocent people. Then I was introduced to the Real IRA’s leader, Mickey McKevitt, along with several of his top men. He liked me straight away, and I liked him. He was easy to talk to and was enthusiastic about American fund-raising money and my ability to get weapons and bomb parts in the US.Over time, I learned he had a sleeper agentin the US who would be brought to the UK when the time was right to shoot Tony Blair , or some other high-level British establishment figure.I met the sleeper several times in Massachusetts and he was keen toget weapons moving to Ireland.Eventually, Mickey suggested I sit on the Real IRA’s army council. I wouldn’t have voting rights, but I could very to US supporters that their money was being well spent and be able to report back on weapons and bomb parts needed by the Real IRA.The army council meetings were held at a farmer’s cottage in the mountains on the border, where the farmer’s we would make us tea, while he discussed bombings in England and assassinations of police officers.I would send detailed emails to the FBI and MI of what was happening.My scariest moment came when I attended the ‘engineering’ orbomb-making meetings.I brought along encryption software for the team that had been doctored by MI.  One of the top bomb makers was very suspicious and said that it might have been tampered with. My heart was racing and I was sweating. I was petried and couldn’t sleep that night. I was really on edge, wonderingthe Real IRA would find out that the encryption software had been compromised. What would happen to me and Maureenthey did  I knew about the torture and death that came to other IRA informers. There was a case in which a woman was beaten to death by three IRA members, while with another informer, they set up a roadblock, shot him in the back of the head and rolled his car into the canal. The police didn’t find his body for two years. That would have been my fate.  I began to wonder how much longer we could stay in this le. Mickey told me he was looking for a foreign sponsor to supply them with weapons and was interested in Saddam Hussein.I told MI, who were excited and saw it as an opportunity to ensnare the Real IRA.It was agreed with MI that I would testy against some of the Real IRA leadership, and in one day there were arrests of leaders in the south of Ireland, the north, and the US. I was flown to a US airbase in Britain, as I was due to testy against three Real IRA council members who had set up meetings with Saddam Hussein’s agents . Then I flew on the British royal jet to testy against Mickey McKevitt, who was arrested at his home. He wasn’t one bit happy to see me this time, and glared at me. I was nervous at the beginning of the trial – there were lots of TV cameras outside the court, and army snipers on the roof of the courtroom. Mickey’s barrister cross-examined me for two weeks. It was gruelling.  After I finally finished testying, the SAS took me by Hercules plane out of Ireland forever. The most stressful part was after I had finished testying and ed to the US in hiding. I had all this adrenaline running through me for years. Suddenly I wasn’t living on the edge any more and couldn’t handle my emotions. I went on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs, Maureen went on them too. We couldn’t adjust to this new passive world after so many years undercover, but I eventually learned to get on with le and enjoy myself. Mickey McKevitt was jailed for  years and I know he will never forgive me. Still, after the Omagh bomb, I have no regrets about what I did.  I also earned millions of dollars from the FBI, but I can never work again because the Real IRA would catch up with me.

Sophie Matheson, , dropped from a size  to a size  in just  weeks after getting in touch with a personal trainer. She got married in October and has since lost another stone, taking her total weight loss to six stone. Sophie, who works at Intake Farm Primary School in Mansfield, said: I had reached a point where I was dreading my wedding day. I was anxious about the photos, how I would look and feel in my dress and what others would think of me, and knew I had to do something to make a positive change.    She got in touch with local personal trainer Luke Hewitt after seeing some of his work on social media. Sophie, who lives in Ollerton, in Nottinghamshire, said she was nervous before her first session but was put at ease by Lukeaposs team. I started to see changes really quickly and began to develop a love for the gym, she told Nottinghamshire Live . She trained with Luke three times a week for  weeks in the lead up to her wedding day, with a programme that included a combination of cardiovascular exercise and weight training as well as a diet plan. Sophie said: My job as a primary school teacher can be quite stressful and fast paced and my diet before starting the programme reflected that. A typical day would have previously started with good intentions, with Weetabix for breakfast and fruit for my mid-morning snack, but then it would start to go downhill. Lunchtime would arrive and the staff room at work would be full of cakes and biscuits, so I’d help myself to those before grabbing a pre-packed wrap or sandwich for lunch. After work, I’d go to the shop and get crisps, sweets and chocolates and binge eat and then dinner would be something like wedges and a burger. We would also indulge in takeaways several times a week.”  Before she lost the weight, Sophie took  tablets a day for endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome , but now she doesnapost take any medication at all. Sophie is a vegetarian and now keeps to a diet plan tailored for her. A typical day would consist of porridge or an omelette for breakfast, Quorn chilli, rice and salad for lunch and halloumi and vegetables kebabs with curried lentils for dinner, as well as ious snacks to keep her going throughout the day. She said: At first I couldnapost believe how much food I was able to eat. Iaposve tried every fad diet going so feeling satisfied rather than deprived made a huge dference to my motivation and sticking power. That, combined with my gym sessions, has completely changed my le for the better. I used to make excuses not to go out to social events and didnapost feel comfortable in anything I tried on. Now, I’m happier in all aspects of le: I’m more confident at work, have an even better relationship with my husband and I’m happier on holiday because I can wear what I want without feeling uncomfortable.”  By her wedding day, Sophie had got her weight down to  stone and wore a size  wedding dress. She has continued training and lost a further stone. She said: I felt amazing on my wedding day, and I definitely have Luke to thank for that, but for me this wasn’t just about losing weight for my wedding. It was about becoming happier and healthier for good and I know I’ll never go back to my old habits because I feel so much better and coming off my medication speaks volumes.  “The gym has become my therapy and no matter what mood I arrive in, I always leave feeling on top of the world.

They were convicted over a payment of £ wired to a man in Lebanon in September  at Jackaposs request, but found not guilty of trying to wire a further payment of £, on December  that year so Jack could pay for a people-smuggler to help him escape. The jury could not agree on a third attempted payment of £. Jack converted to Islam as a teenager, and it has been suggested he was radicalised by someone he met at a mosque in Oxford when he left school after failing his AS levels. His parents gave him money to travel to the Middle East in May  to study Arabic, first in Jordan and then Kuwait. But, in September , he rang Sally and told her: Mum, Iaposm in Syria. However, by  he had become disillusioned with the group and attempted to leave. He was captured by Kurdish forces and is still in jail in northern Syria, now aged .Sally told the Mail on Sunday she was immensely pleased not to be in prison but her le was in ruins, while John said the conviction destroys me. Sally said: My career and my le are in ruins. The people I used to work with donapostmy calls. Above all, Jack is still a prisoner. I feel guilty when itaposs a nice, sunny day, because Jack is shut up in a room with no access to the open air. My fear now is they are trying to make him so ill he either dies or kills himself. She said she thinks about her son every second of every day. John said: Being found to have supported terrorism is a tremendous blow. Itaposs going to have a huge impact. Inside, it destroys me. But he added he will never give up on his son. The trial heard that the pair refused to believe their -year-old son had become an extremist when they allowed him to travel, and following the verdicts they said they remain committed to help Jackhome. Judge Nicholas Hilliard said he was suspending their sentences only because of very special circumstances and he accepted that the pair loved Jack very much, but warned they had lost sight of realities and ignored warnings. The Mail reported that Jackaposs mental health was deteriorating by the age of , and was diagnosed with Touretteaposs syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.   He converted to Islam soon afterwards but John said prayer became one of his OCD ritiuals.  Jackaposs best friend Mazen told the Mail on Sunday said he had seen Jackaposs mental health deteriorate after the age of . He said that before he left the country, he would sit in a corner, whispering to himself in Arabic. While he was in Syria and Iraq, his parents said he often tried to reassure them that he was safe and not in a warzone and not a fighter. In January , he married Asmaa, the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader, who his parents have spoken to just once by phone. The couple had a son, but it is not knownAsmaa or the child are still alive.Five months after his marriage, Jack was hit by shrapnel from an air strike and taken to Raqqa for medical treatment. From this point he appeared to become more militant, including posting on Facebook about carrying out a aposmartyrdom operationapos against the British Army.In September , they agreed to send £ to Jack, accepting his assurance it was aposnoting to do with jihadapos and was to help someone in poverty who needed new glasses. From December  Jack began to ask his parents to send money to help him escape. Although they were initially told they had permission to fund Jackaposs escape, this was later rescinded and they were told they would be prosecuted. Jack Letts has admitted he was at one time prepared to carry out a suicide attack, telling the BBC: I used to want to, at one point, believe it or not. Not a vest. I wanted to do it in a car. I saidthereaposs a chance, I will do it. In the interview, which took place in October last year but was not broadcast until his parentsapos trial had ended, he said he realised he had been an enemy of Britain but added he had made a big mistake.

Part of her fallopian tubes were removed as she slept because Lindsay, , had twice suffered le-threatening pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. But she says she did not give permission and is devastated that she can no longer have children. Lindsay – who received £, compensation – says: “I woke and was told they’d performed the procedure. I didn’t want it and had been told it definitely wouldn’t be done that day. “I was completely distraught, just devastated. Doctors took away my chance to have more children. “How can they do that to someone  How is that fair  I feel like they ruined my le. I should have been bonding with my new baby, but all I could think was, ‘I’ll never get to have another child.’ I was inconsolable.”    Lindsay’s shattering experience happened at St James’ Hospital, Leeds, in April, . She is speaking out now to alert other mums. On the day of her planned C-section, a midwe asked Lindsay what contraception she planed to use after the birth – and mentioned sterilisation for the first time. Lindsay said: “I certainly didn’t agree to it. I didn’t sign anything and at no point did I give consent to go ahead with the op. I was categorically told it would not be done that day. “It is a huge decision and one I would have needed to discuss with my partner. It’s not something you can decide minutes before having a baby. “When I woke up, I was told they’d done it. They took my choice away. It was horrendous. I kept thinking, ‘What the hell have they done to me’ ” Her daughter Lacie arrived safe and sound – and is now five. Lindsay and partner Martin already had son Harvey, now . He was born after a dficult pregnancy during which Lindsay developed pre-eclampsia.    The condition causes high blood pressure and swelling, with potentially further serious complications. Lindsay adds: “I had to deliver Harvey by C-section seven weeks early. I was in hospital two weeks and Harvey was in for five, because he was premature.” When Lindsay suffered pre-eclampsia again, while carrying Lacie, doctors warned a third pregnancy could put her le at risk. But Lindsay goes on: “I knew it would be risky. But I always wanted more children. It breaks my heart every time Harvey says, ‘Mummy are we going to have another brother or sister  I say, ‘No, we can’t’. It is a very hard operation to reverse and at my age, the chances of it working are slim to none.” Leeds NHS Trust acknowledged its “shortcomings” and said: “We have a more comprehensive approach to recording consent for patients, which fully adheres to legislation.” "},{"url":null,"title":"obese woman who gorged 100","story":"NewsObese woman who gorged on  packets of crisps a month sheds nearly nine stoneTina Cotton sunk into a deep depression after suffering three miscarriages which doctors said might be down to her weight.

At her heaviest Tina Cotton, now , tipped the scales at more than st and was told her weight might be to blame for three miscarriages. She sunk into a deep depression gorging on cheese and onion crisps and other junk food. But in January , Tina, from Tamworth, Staffs, made a vow to turn her le around and stuck to it. The mum-of-three now weighs a healthy st lbs and is a dress size  after ditching the crisps for a calorie-controlled diet and walking thousands of steps a day, which she monitors using her Fitbit.    School cook Tina said: I donapost eat any crisps at all now, I canapost believe I used to put away so many. Iaposd have at least three packs a day. I was a comfort eater, Iaposd eat until I felt sick most days. After I lost my three babies I just couldnapost cope with the fact I wasnapost going to be a mum again. I felt sad all the time and wasnapost taking care of myself at all. Now I have a balanced diet, I do traditional calorie counting, I find it works better than any of these groups that people are obsessed about. As well as eating properly I make sure to do at least , steps-a-day, some days I even manage ,, like on a recent family holiday.

All I would think about was my ovulation cycle, and which exact days to have sex on- it got very clinical. I was spending all my money on pregnancy tests, it was all I thought about, it wasnapost healthy at all.    After the devastating visit to her local GP she decided she needed to stop trying for another baby aposfor her own sanityapos. And after two years of aposeating her feelingsapos a morbidly obese Tina knew it was time for a change. I had been trying little diets here and there but none of it stuck, I just couldnapost keep it up and would be back to my old ways comfort eating and shoving junk food into me, she said. Weight loss groups just werenapost for me and had ironically actually put me off dieting. But just before Christmas I realised that something had to give, I had nothing to wear for Christmas day and was too embarrassed to go shopping for size  stuff in the shops. Thankfully what Iaposd ordered online did fit in the end but I realised it was no way to live. I started my diet on the second of January and applied everything Iaposd already learned from my previous failed attempts. I also cut out alcohol which helped massively. Because I was so big to start with, when the weight came off it was really noticeable, and I felt amazing - that really gave me a kick start to carry on. My husband wasnapost too happy at first with all the new healthy meals I was making us so I just ended up cooking two dinners. He stuck to his pies and mash while I was chomping away on salads and grilled chicken! But heaposs always been super supportive - I couldnapost have done it without him. Joining weight loss Facebook and Instagram groups to gather hints and tips, Tina lost an incredible six stone in the first year.But after finding that her weight loss had plateaued Tinaaposs work colleague recommended aposgood old-fashioned calorie countingapos which kick stared a new wave of her progress. Not only was Tina delighted to find her body shrinking but her boobs went from H to D. Itaposs taken a literal weight off my shoulders, although they now are quite saggy, she said. Iaposm saving up for a boob job to get them perkier. Some of my mates are even telling me not to lose anymore weight but Iaposm not really planning to as Iaposm at my ideal weight now.

She made her first visit to the food bank on Friday. She told Plymouth Live : It was horrendous walking into the food bank. I went in with my mum and I walked in crying, even thought I tried not to. I explained we had been told to come in but I was told they had never heard of me which made me cry harder. “It was explained to me I needed a specic referral such as from Torbay Social Services, and they don’t like having to decide whether I should get to use the food bank so I needed to do that next time. I was a blubbering mess and felt awkward and uncomfortable. I was given a list of where I could go in the future. At that moment none of it mattered because I felt guilty I was using a service I should not be using.  I feel like I’m not vulnerable like these poor homeless people who were also there. I had a home, a bed and a nice shirt on. It just did not feel right. “They took my name and address and asked what my circumstances were.

Iaposm trying to keep going and keep my head above water and still live a normal le, but behind closed doors Iaposve been really struggling with money. I get tax credits which are about £ a week. It used to be more, but in the last couple of months that has been cut as well.

It prompted her to post a video on YouTube called aposWhere to Go From Hereapos  She said: I will go back to work on Monday and I will smile and laugh because I always do and I like my job. I’m working to survive, but I’m not even surviving. I don’t know what is going to happen next week. I have watered down my situation with colleagues because it is embarrassing. Elyshia said it is not feasible for her to move back in with her parents, and taking on extra night shts would create childcare problems. There seems to be a gap missing of support, she said. I am fed up of feeling like a failure and a burden. I will work harderI need to, I donapost have a problem with that, but I need to see the future and a goal. If I get a second job I will get taxed to death still and would have to figure out childcare wise which would work for my son. I can feel myself losing my optimism and passion.

Obviously I was scared for my dadaposs sake, and my sisteraposs baby plays in the front room.  The family told police and installed CCTV cameras outside their home on the advice of officers. Two days later, on June , another brick was thrown through the window of her sisteraposs car outside her home in Cardf. And one week later, on June , Lisa discovered the back window of her own car had been smashed by a large brick. The CCTV showed a person throwing the brick into the back of the car before running away.  Lisa, a customer service manager at Ladbrokes in Cardf, has reported all the incidents to the police, but she said officers told her there was not enough evidence to identy a suspect. He had a scarf over his face so the police obviously didnapost have enough evidence, she said. But the next day, on June , Lisa and her boyfriend heard something outside at around .am and looked out of the window to see her car was on fire. My boyfriend saw it outside our window, she said. He shouted, aposyour car is on fireapos. So I got out of bed shouting and crying because the car is literally three inches from the house. My youngest sister was in the house.  The fire service and the police were called and fortunately nobody was hurt. CCTV picked up a person pouring petrol over the pavement and into the broken window of Lisaaposs car. They lit the pavement on fire and then the car. Lisa, who has been left terried by the incident, said the car was completely destroyed and the police have put her in touch with Womenaposs Aid and installed a fire-proof letter box and fire alarms in the house.  Iaposm really anxious. I havenapost got my car. I donapost want to go anywhere on my own, she said. Lisa said her anxiety has been made worse because of a group of incidents involving her former partner two years ago. In November , her partner stabbed a friend of Lisa’s while they were driving in a car near her home. He was convicted of an offence of grievous bodily harm and putting a person in fear of violence. He was sentenced to  months in prison and a restraining order preventing him from contacting Lisa or her friend was put in place. On Wednesday, South Wales Police said a -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson and breaching a restraining order but was released without charge. A spokeswoman said: “Protecting victims of domestic abuse is a priority for South Wales Police and a full safeguarding plan is in place for the female in this case.” "},{"url":null,"title":"people shocked womans unusual engagement","story":"NewsPeople shocked by womans unusual engagement ring - then they notice her nailsThe woman shared her happy engagement news with a photo of her new ring in front of a gorgeous beach - but people were distracted by her nailsShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsShe shared her happy news on social media, but people were distracted \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman was relentlessly mocked for her manicure when she shared a celebratory photo of her new engagement ring.

His parents ensured he had staff tending to his every need, and the gardens of his home were filled with cages containing monkeys and bears for his entertainment. Huge playrooms boasted more toys than any European store and the gardens inside the walled compounds where he was raised were so large that many called them parks. A personal chef was hired to be the future North Korean dictatoraposs friend - and the young Kim would don military gear to boss adults around. Thataposs according to a new book about the feared world leader, who executed his uncle and had his half-brother killed with a nerve agent.  Washington Post journalist Anna Field has chronicled his le as a child and as a teenager sent to study in Switzerland in new book The Great Successor. The son of former Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il - who died in  - and grandson of the countryaposs founder, Kim Il-sung, he was a spoiled brat in childhood. Contact with other children was scarce, Field writes, with his eighth birthday party attended by high-ranking adults instead of other children. In an interview with Vox, Field said: He was brought up to believe that he was a demigod from the age of three or four, probably as long as he can remember.  Even when North Koreans were plunged into famine, Kim was probably unaware of the horric conditions they were enduring, she believes. Determined to give the young boy the same mythical status afforded to his father and grandfather, propagandists claimed Kim was such a good marksman that he could hit a lightbulb from  metres. When he was eight, it was claimed he could drive a truck at mph. The author said he was close to his mother, Ko Yong Hui, from who he got the belief that he was a military genius, as well as a love of basketball.  Her influence was seen everywhere from the cartoons of her that suddenly started appearing on TV to the way her sons were promoted and moved up the ranks, Field stated. In the s Kim was sent to live and study at the International School of Bern in Switzerland under a  identity. This was done in the hope that exposure to the West would turn him into a reformer - but the author said the opposite was true. She told Vox: What his time in Switzerland must have taught him is thatit wasn’t for the family myth and family dynasty, he’d be a nobody. Knowing that without his connections he would be another ordinary, chubby immigrant kid going to school and struggling with his math homework, he decided to perpetuate the system.  Although he would kick and spit on his fellow students in fits of anger and frustration, Field said there is no evidence of Kim being a pyschopath - and he did make four close friends. He would regularly play basketball after school, watched by his uncle and aunt who acted as his s. They would set up picnic-like chairs and cheer him on - something classmates found odd.When he did take over from his father in , many thought the dynasty would collapse within months. But Field writes that his every move is calculated to ensure he stays in power.  Under Kim, the country carried out its first successful hydrogen bomb test in , and has developed a new generation of cyber hackers. Field believes that Kim is very consciously trying to look like his grandfather, who is still revered in North Korea. And Kimaposs ruthlessness has not seen members of his immediate family spared. Half-brother Kim Jong-nam died after being attacked with a nerve agent at Kuala Lumpar International Airport in Malasia in . While his death is regarded officially as an assassination, it is thought of by many as a public execution.  Although it has never been proved, Kim is believed to have ordered the killing, believing his half-brother was a threat. Four North Korean suspects left the airport shortly after the assassination and left Korea without being arrested. And his uncle Jang Song Thaek - described in North Korean media as despicable human scum, worse than a dog - was reportedly fed to  hungry dogs in .

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"high street fashions boost charity funds","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHigh Street style and a good cause drew fashion-conscious ladies from miles around to Lochgilphead Joint Campus.The Mid Argyll group of the Marie Curie charity hosted a special fundraising fashion show on Monday June  in association with Colours.An audience of around  eager shoppers were treated to fashion items from shoes to cardigans and handbags to floaty summer skirts, all well known brands at discount prices.The evening, which included a raffle featuring excellent prizes, raised around £, for Marie Curie, which offers support to people and families affected by terminal illness.Jenny Brolly of the Mid Argyll Marie Curie fundraising group said: #Once again thanks to the community for turning out to support Marie Curie.#An enjoyable evening was had by everyone.#"},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The school, which is at the heart of more than  new homes at Letham Mains, is being funded entirely through developersrsquo contributions.Morrison Construction, which is also behind the development of the nearby East Lothian Community Hospital, was appointed to build the primary school, which will have  classrooms suitable for pre-school and primary teaching, a dining hall, social space and a two-court PE hall with retractable seating for performance and community use.Now the foundations and concrete base have been completed and the steel frame is being put in place.As part of the projectrsquos commitment to sustainability,  tonnes of ground soil taken from the site have been moved to other projects in the county, including a BMX track in Musselburgh.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, a Haddington ward member and cabinet spokeswoman for education, visited the site to meet with Morrison Constructionrsquos team there.She said: ldquoItrsquos great to see the progress that is being made on the new school.ldquoHaddington is growing, with people choosing to live here because itrsquos a lovely town with beautul natural settings and good transport links within the county and wider region.ldquoItrsquos important that we keep up with the pace of growth, have facilities in place to accommodate it, and ensure our wider community benefits from it.ldquoI look forward to ing to Letham Mains Primary School later in the construction process as it continues to take shape.Outside the new building, areas will be designed for outdoor learning, PE and play.Jim Hanna, Morrison Construction project director, said: ldquoIt was great to be joined by council representatives on site so they could see the progress we are making.ldquoWith groundworks and foundations complete, we are now under way with the steel frame for the new building which will start to provide the community with a sense of what the school will look like once delivered.ldquoMorrison Construction is committed to minimising the impact of our activities on the environment and local community.ldquoAlready during the project we have been able to ert hundreds of tonnes of soil from landfill for reuse at Musselburgh, and we look forward to maintaining a proactive approach to sustainability throughout our time at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-musselburgh-gala-2019","story":"Organised by Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, the fun-packed event is adored by youngsters in the Honest Toun.From noon until pm, there is a range of activities on offer including shows, quad bikes, face painting and dance displays.Edinburgh magician Alexander the Great will enthral gala visitors with his magic and circus skills show and Dinky Donuts will be present to keep those hunger pangs at bay.East Coast FM lead the fun and games as compegraveres.Also present will be Musselburghrsquos Army Cadets, Air Cadets and Sea Cadets, with musical entertainment provided by the Penicuik and Musselburgh Boysrsquo Brigade Pipe Band.Representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership will also be on hand to discuss its work with the local community.The Brunton Bistro serves tea, coffee, sandwiches and pies in a marquee.For those who prefer a snack as they enjoy the many activities, Sizzlers are selling food such as burgers, bacon rolls and chips.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-pride-march-marks-stonewall-anniversary","story":"The colourful procession followed a route up the Royal Mile, before turning on to George IV Bridge and finishing at the Edinburgh University Studentsrsquo Association campus.:Thousands take part in Edinburgh Pride marchThe festival is taking place five decades on from the Stonewall riots of  in New York, an uprising by young LGBT people that changed the face of the gay rights movement in the US and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-heavyweight-attended-russia-celebration-by-state-diplomatic-service","story":"Christine Grahame, in her capacity as the Parliamentrsquos deputy presiding officer, was present even though sanctions remain in place on Russia over its nerve agent attack in Salisbury.Scottish Tory MP John Lamont said: ldquoThis link does Scottish politics no good.Relations between the UK and Russia are at a low following assassination attempts by Putinrsquos regime against former intelligence agents on British soil.In , Alexander Litvinenko died after two Russian operatives poisoned his drink with plutonium in a hotel in London.Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were last year found on a park bench in Salisbury after they came into contact with the deadly chemical novichok, planted by Russian agents.Putinrsquos state was blamed for the botched hit job and the international community responded by stepping up sanctions and expelling diplomats, including  from the UK.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon backed Prime Minister Theresa May and said it was clear Russia ldquocannot be permitted to unlawfully kill or attempt to kill people on the streets of the UK with impunity.It was also reported that plans to develop up to poundbn worth of trade links between Scotland and Russia had been abandoned.Despite the poor relations between the UK and Russia, Putinrsquos state still has a diplomatic outpost in Edinburgh, headed by consul general Andrey Pritsepov.A graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Pritsepov had previous postings in Scandinavia and London before taking up his current job.In a tweet last week, the Edinburgh branch of the Russian diplomatic service stated: ldquoOn  June  a diplomatic reception on the occasion of the National Day of Russia was hosted by the Consulate General of Russia in Edinburgh.

Therefore, I have spoken to SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster today to reiterate that point once again, and I will follow it up in writing. He and the SPFL have committed to discuss the matter at the next board meeting.The Justice Committee, which is made up of SNP, Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and Green MSPs, has intervened by making its own approach to the SPFL.In her letter to Doncaster, Mitchell wrote to ldquoadd to the calls for the SPFL to publish the report:ldquoThis was referred to earlier this week in the Scottish Parliament and the Committee believes that transparency on this matter is essential.ldquoYou will be aware that the Justice Committee has undertaken a signicant amount of work in recent years on the problem of sectarianism at football, including consideration of legislation in this area.

Napoleon slept, it is said, with a version of the ldquoCeltic Homer under his pillow as he fought his campaigns in Egypt, and the German literary giant Goethe was famously inspired by the tales of the blind, third-century bard Ossian, and the adventures of Fingal and Oscar, Malvina and King Swaran.Indeed, Macphersonrsquos writings ndash fragments, he contended, of ancient Gaelic stories, tales and songs that he had collected, translated and heard ndash inspired composers, poets, politicians and artists across Europe. In Britain alone, the works of the man from Ruthven, Badenoch, influenced Burns and Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott and Byron.However, the Ossian tales as told by Macpherson in a series of publications starting with Fragments Of Ancient Poetry in  ndash largely gloomy stories of wars and loss, tumultuous epic landscapes roiling with storms and conflict ndash were publicly savaged by critics, most notably Samuel Johnson, one of the most famous men of letters of his day.Johnson said the Ossian tales as presented by Macpherson were ldquoas gross an imposition ever the world was troubled with. The charge was that Macpherson was a fraud, and had essentially written the works himself.The controversy was huge at the time: Macpherson defended his work,not as robustly as an author may do in these more media-savvy times ndash one account notes that he challenged Johnson to a duel ndash and the Highland Society of Scotland launched an official investigation, which found, albeit not until , that he had used genuine material in his work.Some  years later, Macphersonrsquos works are little known, and have not benefited from a renaissance in their audience through radio, television or film: Ossian is not a namethat creates many ripples in popular culture.However, a major new show at Scotlandrsquos National Museum ndash Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, which opens this week ndash hopes to shine a new light on the Ossian controversy. It shows the Ossian tales as crucial to the development of Romantic thought and literature in the late th century, and states clearly, and provides evidence, that Macpherson based his work on authentic texts.Scholars, too, see the whole controversy at the crux of a tension between industrialised central Scotland and the rapidly changing Highlands, and between Scottish culture and the burgeoning idea of British Empire and the dominance of obviously ldquoEnglish culture.Johnsonrsquos ridiculing of Macpherson was much more than a literary argument: the cultural and political undercurrents of the controversy are unmistakable.The exhibition includes one of Macphersonrsquos sources, the Red Book of Clanranald. It adds: ldquoJames Macpherson maintained that his translations of the Ossian cycle were based on authentic Gaelic verse, ballads and songs, collected during his travels in the Scottish Highlands ... Macpherson consulted and collected original Gaelic manuscripts belonging to numerous Highland families.ldquoThese included the Red Book of Clanranald, a volume containing the history and lore of Clan Donald, which was compiled by a member of the MacMhuirich family of bards.The curator of the show, Dr Patrick Watt, said that Macpherson was ldquoscholarly and rigorous in his research.He said: ldquoMacpherson definitely made use of old manuscript sources, we have that one in our show. Itrsquos very interesting to see how he approached his task ndash he had evidence. These are real things, whether he actually changed them or not, we are almost past that now.ldquoI think when you look at it for what it is ndash a lasting interpretation of the remnants of Gaelic poetry ndash then it is fantastic. If you read them, they are incredibly interesting, the characters that are portrayed are fascinating ... the thing that really hit me was that you have a man who goes for himself to investigate these documents. Why did he do this  I doubt it was because he thought it was going to be a best seller.One of the contributors to the show, Dr Domhnall Uilleam Stiugravebhart of Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, believes it is high time for Scotland to move beyond the debate over the ldquoauthenticity of Macphersonrsquos Ossian tales.He said: ldquoYou could talk about it for hours, it is an under-researched part of our own history, which at long last, we can stop being embarrassed about. Put to one side questions of authenticity, and think about how it was put together. It was not just a work of literature, it was seen as a historical document when it was first being produced. It was first produced with footnotes.ldquoMacpherson ushered in an age of romantic nationalism which is still with us. We have never really left that age, and by looking at Macpherson we can fruitfully compare him with other national myths, national epics that were being created, or shall we say recreated, in the th and th centuries, including JRR Tolkienrsquos own attempts to provide the English with national myth in the form of Lord of the Rings.Of the controversy, he added: ldquoIs Macpherson a fraud and a faker ndash or is he perhaps trying to do something possibly a bit more interesting with his own native culture  There is absolutely no doubt, first of all, that he made stuff up.ldquoAt the same time, and we should say that very quickly indeed, he was drawing upon an existing culture of Gaelic, heroic ballads common to both Scotland and Ireland, they date from the middle ages, and they are about Fionn mac Cumhaill and his heroic band, and the defender of Ulster, Cuacutechulainn.Professor Nigel Leask, Regius Chair of English language and literature at the University of Glasgow, says that scholarship suggests Macpherson drew upon about  traditional Fenian ballads ndash that is, medieval and post-medieval heroic ballads in Gaelic relating the feats of Fionn mac Cumhaill and his warrior band the Fianna ndash working from notes of transcriptions made from oral performances and some old Gaelic manuscripts.He added: ldquoBut there was a lot of lsquopaddingrsquo, and his most ambitious long poems Fingal and Temora presented the ballads in the form of epics, modelled on the th centuryrsquos understanding of Homerrsquos Iliad and modern sentimental poetry.Professor Tom Devine, the distinguished historian, has another view of the Macpherson controversy. He notes the tension between the myth that Macpherson was writing, and the reality of Scotland ndash and indeed Britain ndash in the late th century.The stormy epic, godless but noble and ancient, contrasted with a country rapidly gearing up to the Industrial Revolution and, in the Highlands, the Clearances.Devine said: ldquoThe impact of Ossian in Europe was quite extraordinary. Itrsquos dficult now, in the cold light of the st-century day, to think of how the celebrati in Europe were seduced by him. The other aspect is you are dealing with two parallel universes at this time ndash at the same time as this almost fictionalised Highland Scotland was being projected, the break-up of the real traditional society was accelerating rapidly.ldquoOssian was having an impact from the s. And that is the decade when you are beginning to see the rapid commercialisation of Highland society. The s are a real break point in the journey towards modernity in Scotland ... we see the first signs of emigration on a major scale, and the first removals from land at a signicant level. So at the same time as a romanticisation is going on, a quite dferent narrative is occurring at the same time.Devine added that the way Macpherson wrote in the tales suggested ndash sometimes explicitly ndash that Highlanders of the late th century were ldquothe antique past, living in the present, in a way which did not exist anywhere  in Britain, a seductive idea because of the ldquosheer pace of advancing modernity in the UK.The works, too, Leask notes, ldquogave new dignity to Gaelic culture and language that had been crushed in the aftermath of Culloden [in ] and, in a way still seen in modern marketing images for Scottish tourism, ldquocast a romantic light on the rugged mountain landscape, and even turned terrible weather ndash mist and rain ndash into a sublime Ossianic experience, encouraging huge number of tourists to visit the region in the romantic period.Watt notes that the debate over Macpherson and what was authentic and what was his own invention may carry on for many years yet.Stiugravebhart added: ldquoYou can spend your entire time knocking your head against a wall, playing lsquospot the genuine versersquo in Ossian. I am not saying we should move on from that, but I think a more fruitful line of enquiry would be to try to examine and analyse what Macpherson was up to, and beyond that, why at this particular juncture this should be such an attractive literary production, not just for people in Scotland but across the world.ldquoI think the first thing to say about Macpherson is that he didnrsquot work alone. He was the poster boy of a coterie of Scottish enlightenment figures who were interested in Scotlandrsquos past and what that past might tell us about the development of society. So, OK, he was creating literature, but he was also bringing to light these incredibly valuable documents, which illustrated what le might have been like in Scotland, , years before.Macpherson, who died in , perhaps did not help himself.Leask says his original inspiration was existing traditional Scottish and Irish ballads about Fionn mac Cumhaill with which he had been familiar since boyhood in the ceilidh houses of Badenoch, as well as further material he collected in the Highlands and Islands in -.He added: ldquo[The verses] were only lsquoauthenticrsquo in the sense that he had freely adapted traditional Gaelic Fenian poetry ndash it would have been betterhe had admitted as much. He was a dficult and curmudgeonly personality, but made a lot of money from his successful literary career.The Ossian texts are available in current publishing such as Blind Ossianrsquos Fingal, published by Luath Press of Edinburgh.Watt says thata filmmaker adapted the works for the screen, the current general lack of knowledge of Macphersonrsquos works would quickly be overturned. In the meantime, the texts are still available to read ndash Leask says itrsquos best to ldquotry reading it loud, taking long breaths, to capture the flavour of the original.Stiugravebhart added, of reading the often ldquogloomy and morbid works: ldquoYoursquove got to let yourself go, plunge in, and live in the moment. Someit is unreadable, some it isnrsquot. Some of it echoes or gives a foretaste of what other romantic writers, with better reputations, would write over the next two generations.ldquoItrsquos always worth having a go with Ossian, and see what you think.Wild and Majestic: Romantic Visions of Scotland, National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh, runs from June  until November ."},{"url":null,"title":"headline-to-come","story":"WHEN she talks about her fatherrsquos long and tortured last days her voice begins to crack. It is only when she gets on to who she blames for killing him and failing her and her family that it regains a steely edge.Justine Gordon-Smith holds the Scottish and UK Governments responsible. For their failure, not just to properly compensate for infecting their dad with the blood products which would finally kill him, but virtually abandoning him and his complex needs and leaving her and her sister to provide round-the-clock care as he became more and more ill.Justine is one of four girls, two of her sisters live away, so it was left to her and her sister Rto look after their father Peter in Edinburgh as he deteriorated from a caring and funny man to a bedridden one they could barely recognise. All four were at his bedside when he died and she can be precise about it ndash it was .pm on July , just  days, she notes, after the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service, which infected him, opened its ldquoshiny new pound million building in the Heriot Watt Centre.Peter Gordon-Smith was a well-known figure on the Scottish music and entertainment scene, a musician and primarily double bass player ndash he backed Shirley Bassey and others ndash and he managed night clubs, worked at the Citizensrsquo Theatre in Glasgow under the legendary Iain Cuthbertson, even managed a youth hostel in the Edinburgh.ldquoHe was a very outgoing man. He loved a yarn and a funny story. He could charm anyone, she recalls. ldquoHe was a very talented musician and he was also very handsome.Peter was a haemophiliac. ldquoWhen we were young I remember him having the odd bleed and he would go to hospital for a few days. But it was manageable. ldquoYou were always very conscious of it and how an injury would affect him.It was in  that Peter was told he was infected with the Hepatitis C virus, although he was not told how he got it or when. It is clear, however, from his medical records that he received clotting agents Factor VIII and cryoprecipitate produced by the transfusion services Protein Fractionation Centre and administered by the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, the RIE.ldquoHe was absolutely outraged when he was told. There was a distinct lack of information about how he became infected. Dad looked into suing the hospital, but that didnrsquot go ahead.Justine, like all the core participants in the new inquiry, has had to sign a non-disclosure agreement ndash in case information at this stage might prejudice future legal chargesanyone is held responsible ndash but she is determined not to be completely silenced.For  years, from when he was told about the infection which would finally kill him, the family received no help or compensation. In  the UK Government set up and funded three charities ndash while refusing to admit liability ndash one of which was the Skipton Fund.ldquoAround that time R found out about it in a newspaper article and we applied to Skipton. Peter subsequently received pound, as well as pound a quarter. The money was used to do up his house, just a stones throw from the Scottish Parliament.Justine, a filmmaker, who was brought up in Edinburgh with sister R, had been living in London but in  ed to pursue a doctorate at Edinburgh University in film and geography. She and R were shortly to become their dadrsquos full-time carers.ldquoHe had been badly beaten in the  and spent a long time in the RIE in . He developed what they call an inhibitor - the clotting agents were facing increasing resistance - and he would turn over in bed and bleed, or opening the door, even shaking hands.In  he developed sores in his legs which refused to heal. In that same year he had a fall in the bath, which led to him developing even more resistance to clotting. At the beginning of  Justine asked the hospital to perform a liver test on Peter. It revealed cancer.ldquoWe used to call him the Comeback Kid, he was so stoic, but this time he said lsquoIrsquove finally hit the buffersrsquo, she recalled.Skipton awarded Peter a further pound,.In May  he was told the cancer was terminal and there would be no further treatment. He was put on steroids and other drugs. ldquoUp until he took the steroids he was a lovely dad. As soon as he took them he went.Justine and her R were now alternating carers. She says she was repeatedly told she was ineligible for carers allowance because she was a student and was unable to work. Later, the sisters were given  hours a week assistance.Peter tried to kill himself in July, taking a massive overdose. After an alert, because the part-time carer couldnrsquot get in, Justine rushed to the house. Her father was saved.ldquoHe was put on fentanyl [a powerful opioid]. This strange creature then appeared who was not our dad, Justine recalls.There was a second suicide attempt in September ndash ldquoGod knows how many Tramadol he took ndash and again he was brought out of it.ldquoThat was the only time I saw him as my dad again. He was so angry he wasnrsquot dead. He didnrsquot want to be alive.Justine and R installed a drug safe in the house so he couldnt try that method again, but he was later to attempt it a third time by stabbing himself. She adds, on the verge of tears again, ldquoWe had become his jailers and his prisoners.After the sisters had taken turns on seven-nights-a-week suicide watch without any support they were given a carer for three nights.ldquoEventually we got seven nights a week, but only when Dad was so frail he required double staffing, but we got at least to sleep in our own beds, Justine says.In  the Scottish Government set up the Scottish Infected Blood Support Scheme which replaced the Skipton and other charities. While it makes payments to those infected, and to partners and dependent children, non-dependent children, carers like Justine and R, donrsquot qualy.ldquoHow can you say itrsquos generous  Why doesnrsquot the government just hold up its hand like the Republic of Ireland The Irish Government has paid out over euro billion in compensation, with the average award euro,.ldquoMy sister lost twenty-one thousand pounds from not working and Irsquom about seventy thousand out of pocket, she says.But itrsquos not about money, itrsquos about justice. ldquoI am outraged at the way our father, our family and other victims and their families have been treated.

He was interested in seeing where his father had come from.Having arrived in Edinburgh, his eyes were opened by the breadth of knowledge of botany that thrived in the city.Johnson adds: ldquoHe wrote lsquoI am very much mortied by my ignorance of botanyrsquo. He was surrounded by people who were completely conversant in botanical science and he didnrsquot know a thing.Hosack resolved to improve his knowledge, and spent hours in botany classes and exploring Edinburghrsquos gardens, including the original botanic garden in Edinburghrsquos Leith Walk, which later evolved into todayrsquos Royal Edinburgh Botanic Garden.Back in New York, he ventured beyond the city limits to Manhattanrsquos untamed pastoral landscape where in  he paid under , for a -acre stretch of land. There he built greenhouses inspired by the ones hersquod seen in Edinburgh and paid tribute to his fatherrsquos birthplace by naming it Elgin Botanic Garden.ldquoHe planted all kinds of agricultural crops, adds Johnson. ldquoItrsquos amazing to think he was growing barley, wheat, cotton and sunflowers on land where the Rockefeller Centre stands today.ldquoHe experimented with native and non-native species.

More than % of respondents supported the plans.The plans have been at the centre of controversy after some womens groups, backed by several prominent SNP MSPs and MPs, say the new legislation could put womens spaces at risk.They claim that predatory men could access womens refuges, toilets and other facilities.Now transgender and non-binary Scots have spoken out about their disappointment following Sommervilles announcement on Thursday.Emily Frood, a trans woman from Edinburgh, said: \"Irsquom ashamed, disappointed, and incredibly upset by the actions the Scottish Government have taken this week in relation the GRA reform.\"Trans and non-binary people in Scotland have been let down.\"The Scottish Government has suggested reforming the GRA in a frankly half-arsed capacity. I would rather a broken manesto promise of not getting the reform implemented by , than have a pathetic reform that includes a not fully self-declaratory method, fails to include  and  year olds as eligible, and completely ignores the validation and recognition of non-binary genders.\"Theyrsquore pandering to a vocal minority of ill-informed and bigoted iniduals, many from the within the SNP, who suggest that the rights of trans people have a detrimental effect on the rights of women. This has never been the case.\"Irsquove campaigned on this reform for nearly four years and to see it get ripped to shreds as a result of what comes across as a public pressure from a minority of bigoted people is heartbreaking.Kerry Rush, who is non-binary and from Edinburgh, added: \"To say Irsquom disappointed is an understatement. Irsquom heartbroken, for myself and for the entire trans and non-binary communities. We waited  months to hear from the Scottish government about our rights, or lack thereof. We were led to believe they were working to help usbe legally recognised and instead we received two pitul sentences [In Sommervilles statement].\"Non-binary people are people and deserve to live and love as part of wider society with the same rights and privileges as others. Instead what this so called progressive Scottish government has done is send a message of absolute disrespect and disregard for all non-binary people.\"I exist and I wonrsquot be erased. I will keep fighting for my existence to be recognised.\"One senior SNP source said that the decision to roll back on the manesto pledge is down to \"weak leadership, and the First Minister not having enough control at the top.\"Colin Macfarlane, director at Stonewall Scotland said: \"Now that the government has made this announcement, and it has fallen well short of what we had hoped, they are going to have to show leadership to ensure they tackle transphobic language when they hear it and when they see it, and ensure it is called out. \"Trans people have had their lives put under the microscope now for the past  months, so it is the governmentrsquos duty of care now to ensure that that rhetoric is dialled down while we go through yet another consultation.\"Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoWe know that some in the trans community will be feeling a sense of deep disappointment at what they see as a lack of progress on trans rights. I want to reassure them that the Scottish Government is committed to reforming the  Act and to removing unnecessary barriers for trans people to live in their true gender. We are committed to doing so during the current parliamentary session.ldquoHowever, it is important for that reform to be passed with strong support from across the Chamber and wider society. So we want to move forward but we also want to achieve consensus where possible.ldquoThe debate about the rights of transgender people is becoming very polarised and we all have a part to play in reducing tensions and encouraging respectful debate.

It was nominated for three Oscars, with Lasseter himself being presented with a Special Achievement Academy Award.ldquoSuddenly, writes Cavalier, ldquothe rush was on for computer-animated features.The rush became a torrent, with ious Hollywood animation studios getting in on an increasingly lucrative trend in film-making and opening a new chapter in the history of animation, a history in which key moments had ranged from early Disney classics to works by influential figures as erse as Tex Avery, Ray Harryhausen and Stirling-born Norman McLaren.Today, the list of top-earning animation movies on the Box Office Mojo website is headed by such films as Incredibles  , Finding Dory, Shrek , The Lion King, Toy Story , Frozen, Finding Nemo, The Secret Le Of Pets, Despicable Me , and Inside Out. Merchandising tie-ins and DVD sales have also been hugely profitable.In , the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences launched a new Oscar category, for Animated Feature Film. The first winner was DreamWorks Animationrsquos Shrek, followed in successive yea rs by Spirited Away, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Wallace  Gromit in The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, Happy Feet, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story , Rango, Brave, Frozen, Big Hero , Inside Out, Zootopia, Coco, and Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. Of these  winners, no fewer than half were products of Disney Pixar.Animated films have become increasingly sophisticated in terms of their storylines. Again, Disney Pixar has blazed an adventurous trail, giving the world films about a lonely little robot cleaning up a ruined Earthan elderly widower who tethers balloons to his house in order to embark on one last adventurethe control centre of the mind of an -year-old girland a young Mexican boy stranded in the Land of the Dead .There was also that remarkably daring scene in Toy Story  when for a few minutes the toys resigned themselves to be an appalling fate, in a trash-incinerating facility. This, observed Empire film magazine, was ldquoa scene of such intense, exquisite end-of-the-line poignancy mdash also the scariest moment of the whole [Toy Story] series mdash that it deserves comparison with Snow Whitersquos terried forest flight, or the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Indeed, much has been made of the emotional palette of the best animated films, and of the \"le lessons\" that can be learned from them. \"Negative feelings are perfectly okay\" is one such, gleaned from Inside Out. Bereavement and grief were powerful impulses in Up.The software used in the making of the films has steadily grown more sophisticated, too.Asnoted this week, the first Toy Story film, in addition to being a critical and box-office success, also helped Pixar to win an ldquoanimation arms race, with visual effects going on to become a staple of blockbuster films. The crucial weapon in all of this, the paper added, is RenderMan, a software tool that enables film-makers to create photorealistic computer images.Toy Story  was made on an updated version of RenderMan, using ray tracing, which, says the , allows animators to achieve granular detail on light shading.Rob Redman, editor of D World  D Artist, is quoted as saying: ldquoThe outdoor scenes in Toy Story  are really where it comes into its own. You get the blues and greens where the sky is bouncing off the floor: it makes everything feel lush and vibrant. \"Realistic\" is not quite the word, but it does feel more real. The textures feel more believable.The Spectatorrsquos film critic, Jasper Rees, concurs. ldquoThe animation now has such a painterly exactness it may as well be real rain stubble tarmac up there on screen, he writes.And while Hollywood may dominate the world of animated movies itrsquos important to remember the influential work of, for example, Studio Ghibli, which is based in Tokyo.It has made a succession of strikingly beautul films, from Spirited Away and My Neighbour Totoro to Howlrsquos Moving Castle and Princess Mononoke.The Red Turtle, a superb animated fantasy ndash a French Japanese production \"presented by Ghibli\" ndash was described in the following terms by the prominent critic, Mark Kermode: ldquoA poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice.\"Eloquent, profound and moving, it left me with a heart full of bittersweet joy, a head dizzy with dreamy visions and cheeks wet from tears that rolled like waves on a distant beach.INCOMINGTHE big US studios have an impressive slate of animated films in the pipeline over the next few years. Some of them are sequels, taking the themes of the original hit film and exploring them further.Disneys Frozen , the long-awaited follow-up to s Frozen, the biggest-grossing animated musical of all time, will be in cinemas this winter.Pixar has two films due out next year: Onward , about two teenage elf brothers \"who embark on an extraordinary quest to discoverthere is still a little magic left out there\" and the newly-announced Soul, which will debut next June .

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate. He’ll also talk at Stromness Academy on Monday June , and at Kirkwall Grammar School that afternoon.

HM Coastguard said the ordnance was found on the seabed during an underwater survey yesterday.The discovery was made just a day after a series of commemorative events took place at Scapa Flow to mark the centenary of the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet, which left  men killed.On Friday, ers from the Royal Navy and the German Navy went underwater to lay wreaths at the site, where more than  German warships were deliberately sunk by their commander at the end of the Second World War so as to prevent them being ided up amongst Allied forces.In the wake of the weekend discovery, a military explosives ordnance disposal team was dispatched from Glasgow. The group is expected to carry out an assessment to make the device safe.An exclusion zone has been set up in the area, with warning signs erected urging people to stay at least  metres away from the waters between Hoy and Cava.Kaimes Beasley, duty controller for HM Coastguard said: \"With weather in the area likely to be good, its more than possible that e charter boats will want to go there, but our strong advice is to keep away.\"Scapa Flow is one of Scotland’s most popular e sites, thanks to the number of British and German wartime relics lying on the seabed.It is not the first time that a torpedo has been discovered in the area. Three years ago, Royal Navy bomb disposal experts were sent to detonate an ordinance thought to have been fired at HMS Royal Oak by a German U-boat in . A total of  men were killed in the naval disaster.During the initial detonation, a section of the bomb containing its own explosive charge broke free and appeared on the surface of the water.However, the Royal Navy team carried out a second controlled explosion to destroy it.The German High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow following Armistice in November  while negotiations for the Treaty of Versailles were ongoing.Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter was in command of the  vessels - viewed as a threat to the UKs dominance at sea - but had not been informed of a last-minute extension to finalise details of the deal.He did not want the assets shared among foreign powers without the German governments consent and was struggling with a mutinous, embarrassed and increasingly bored crew.With the previous deadline for a treaty passed, he issued an order to scuttle the ships.The admiral was made a prisoner of war but his act of defiance was celebrated in Germany.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm we are poorly served by a political class devoid of self doubt","story":"Alex Salmond waged war on nuance five years ago, and the equally certain Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are keeping up the good fight, writes Euan McColm. Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Johan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case Good questionI think more and more there will be speed limiters on cars and insurance companies and Companies already want these.Johan,The EU has already sorted this one for us.Thanks MHJ. Electric self charging cars available by then too I would think.It’s an attractive and interesting idea Johan but I doubt that such a short time scale will see the hope come to fruition.Predictions do not suggest that the high cost of EV manufacture will reduce for quite some time to make such purchases viable in the immediate future.Motor production is going through an increasingly lean time and it seems unlikely to me that the decline will bounce back into the black by trying to incrrease the sales of expensive electric cars.

A deep free-kick headed back across goal fell invitingly for Oates to clinically drill the ball home, before another quick counter-attack saw Daniel Simpson fire home after Lee Gale’s shot had been blocked.Their misery was complete when a long ball pumped forward saw Swanson misjudge, allowing Oates to complete his hat-trick at the second attempt.Shetland manager Kevin Main said after the match that he was #sick of hard luck stories this week#.#It was an extremely competitive match and one we were expecting.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre.

Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers.

We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under.

Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Kenneth stands aghast as chants of ‘Greysteel seven, Ireland nil’ rain down from the stands as the match kicks off.Shell-shocked following the match and all that went on during those fraught  minutes, Kenneth brings Ernie home and begins to question what could be his inevitable pathhe doesn’t start making some changes.Lead actor Matthew Forsythe has a total of  roles to portray in this fast, furious and incredibly demanding one-man show. It’s no easy task but each character is brought to le vividly through his tone, his stance and his voice. Even a simple fold of the arms can work wonders, whether’s it’s Kenneth’s ‘keeping up with the Jones’ snooty we Deborah, his boss Gerry, or Wee Ernie, the bitter and wheezing father-in-law.Chris Hunter’s set design is in a sense the only other character beside Kenneth and that too is brought imaginatively and effectively to le. Astro turf gives us our pitch, but it’s the innovative scattering of cardboard boxes that turn into Kenneth’s car, his desk, chair – even the soaring New York skyline – which work to greatest effect. A particularly effective ploy is the backdrop of a distorted mirror showing us, the audience, and inviting us to join Kenneth on his journey of reflection.The play comes  years after the curtain first came up in Dubblejoint’s Whiterock theatre space. It remains as dramatic, funny, poignant, worrying and challenging as it was when it burst into our consciousness all those years ago. The question is, how much has changed outside the theatre A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre until June  and will then go on tour.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"22 northern ireland schools could close because

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals.

Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels. Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be.

Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"   Deputy Leader of the DUP Nigel Dodds, Boris Johnson and DUP Party leader Arlene Foster Mr Johnson addressed the DUP annual party conference in Belfast last November.However, Mr Robinson told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show that his party has good relationships with most of the candidates.Youd be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with usDUP MP Gavin Robinson“You’d be amazed at how many people in the House of Commons want to build a relationship with us , and we do have good relationships with almost all of the candidates that were seeking to be on the paper to succeed as Conservative leader, and the same is true of Jeremy Hunt,” he said.Mr Johnson earlier this year voted for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit Withdrawal Deal – which the DUP opposed – despite earlier saying he would not back it.“It clearly contradicted what he had said previously where he had given clear indications that he doesn’t like the backstop and indeed he has reiterated those since, I think there was a quest within the Conservative ranks to get this done in the belief that evenyou were to vote for the Withdrawal Agreement, you could change it afterwards,” Mr Robinson said.“We saw the flaw in that approach at the time so we didn’t back the Withdrawal Agreement because we believed once the structures of the agreement were affirmed, it would be very dficult to change those structures. Boris Johnson now accepts that’s the right case.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Conservative party leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt “I think he recognises our concerns, he sees that a border down the Irish Sea – as does Jeremy Hunt – both recognise that sort of a border, that impediment to trade between one part of the United Kingdom and another, or indeed the insistence from the European Union they should have any say in interrupting the internal affairs of this country is wrong.“So the position they have adopted through this campaign, and previously, is positive from a unionist perspective.”Turning to a future deal under which the UK will leave the EU, Mr Robinson said his party will continue to use its influence to press for the protection of the union.“They are a long way from delivering a deal andwe are involved in discussions with them and advocating our position to them, we’ll be making sure that no outcome is going to be detrimental to this union we cherish,” he said.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the wait to find out who will be the next prime minister will not stop the ongoing political talks in Northern Ireland to restore powersharing government.“We approach the talks positively, we want to see a resolution and a re establishment of the institutions at Stormont, we think Northern Ireland as a society benefits from having a democratically elected, locally accountable decision making process,” he said.“We want to see that now and when a deal is right, a deal will be done.“The engagement you could say starts and stops, but there is a level of productivity now where I think the engagement is sincere. “That doesn’t mean that all the issues are resolved, and you’ll have heard other commentary which suggests they are not, but the willingness I think is there and the prize to have a restoration of the Executive is there to be achieved provided you get an outcome which is fair, which is proportionate, which is balanced.”"},{"url":null,"title":"future pm seeking to delay brexit would face eu hostility varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Next up it’s the @EPP summit pic lIyRhPsx— Leo VaradkarJune , He said: “While I have endless patience, some of my colleagues have lost patience, quite frankly, with the UK, and there’s enormous hostility to any further extension.“So, I think an extension could only really happenit were to facilitate something like a general election in the UK or perhaps even something like a second referendum,they decided to have one.“What won’t be entertained is an extension for further negotiations or further indicative votes. The time for that has long since passed.”Mr Varadkar had a meeting with the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Thursday morning, at which, the Taoiseach said, the pair agreed that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened but that they were willing to consider amendments to the joint Political Declaration.And he warned: “There’s no Withdrawal Agreement without a backstop and there’s no implementation period without a Withdrawal Agreement.”Two years on after the first round of #Brexit negotiations: good discussion with An Taoiseach @LeoVaradkar, @HMcEntee and their team today on Brexit 🇪🇺🇮🇪 pic ybCkhoJUFV— Michel BarnierJune , Mr Barnier, writing on Twitter, said the pair had a “good discussion”.Of the remaining three Tory leadership hopefuls, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the EU “would be willing to renegotiate” a Brexit deal, and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has said he would delay Britain’s departurehe was on the cusp of deal.Front-runner Boris Johnson has said it is essential the UK leaves on October , and suggested the Irish backstop issues could be solved during the implementation period.Earlier, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte said the next prime minister needs to realise a no-deal Brexit would be bad for the UK.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “With a hard Brexit, even with a normal Brexit, the UK will be a dferent country.I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit. I dont see how you can sweeten itMark Rutte“It will be a diminished country. It is unavoidable.”And he said there could not be a transition perioda Withdrawal Agreement was not in place, telling the BBC: “As Boris Johnson would say, Brexit is Brexit.“I would say a hard Brexit is a hard Brexit. I don’t see how you can sweeten it.”Nigel Dodds claimed Mr Rutte’s remarks were “utterly uninformed and careless” and saidthe Dutch PM and other EU leaders want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland “then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject”.The DUP’s Westminster leader said: “The Republic of Ireland’s prime minister has been to the fore in feeding emotionally charged but inaccurate information to his fellow EU heads of government.The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of BritishnessNigel Dodds, DUP“From photocopying and distributing -year-old border bomb stories to repeatedly twisting the Belfast St Andrews Agreements for his own political ends, Leo Varadkar has painted a wildly inaccurate picture for the EU about Northern Ireland and theborder.“London, Brussels and Dublin have all confirmed that even in a no-deal scenario, there would be no hard border. Therefore the comments by Mark Rutte today were utterly uninformed and careless.“Mr Rutte may not realise, but only  days ago the same republican terrorist ideology which bombed the border checkpoints  years ago, attempted to murder a police officer in Belfast.“The desire for murder is not driven by pro-EU sentiments or anti-Brexit sentiments but by a deep sectarian hatred of Britishness.“If Mr Rutte and his fellow EU leaders really want to protect the peace process in Northern Ireland, then they will not impose a deal which all unionists in Northern Ireland reject.“They will work for a sensible deal which everyone can support.“Building a new border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom would run absolutely contrary to the Belfast Agreement.”"},{"url":null,"title":"half of northern ireland population neither unionist nor nationalist survey says","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As recently as last week members of Westminsters Foreign Affairs Committee visited the area and heard similar concerns.Read MoreBrexits impact on many cross-border initiatives finally revealed in reportAs we boarded the plane to head back to London news broke of what would come to be known as the backstop agreement between the EU and UK namely that in the absence of another solution to keep the border open with no checks and no infrastructure, Northern Ireland would effectively remain within the EU customs union and large parts of the EUs single market.In the joint report published by the UK Government and the EU the following day - December ,  - we had the first mention of the mapping exercise which showed how North-South co-operation, established under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, relied to a signicant extent on a common EU legal and policy framework.The document noted that the UKs departure from the EU \"gives rise to substantial challenges to the maintenance and development of North-South co-operation\".Hoping the mapping exercise would provide answers to the people we met in Co Armagh, our committee went to considerable efforts to secure its publication.We called for this to happen in reports in March, May and September .We wrote letters to consecutive Brexit Secretaries of State in April, August, October, November and December . We asked for the document, face-to-face, in April and July . Despite the publication of a technical explanatory note in December , we did not get the full story until this week, after it was obtained by a member of the public through a Freedom of Information request.The document, which we have now published, lists  areas of le in Northern Ireland that could be impacted by Brexit.It demonstrates very clearly that the residents of Armagh were right to be concerned, as many areas of co-operation are \"not underpinned or linked\" to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement.Its deeply disappointing that the Department for Exiting the EU did not choose to share this information with us or with the people of Northern Ireland. Its another example of the Government not giving Parliament the facts which we need to help inform our decision-making.The stakes are even higher now as the clock ticks and the Conservative leadership debate takes up some of the available time until October , just  weeks away.Alternative arrangements for the border are highly unlikely to be in place by then or indeed any time soon, which makes the transition and the backstop as important as ever. And as for leaving with no deal, our committee concluded in January that a managed no-deal cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government.Hilary Benn MP is chair of the Committee on Exiting the European Union"},{"url":null,"title":"late goal only a consolation for cavan as impressive donegal secure fifth ulster title of decade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They had much more success once they had their best forwards on the field. They probably scored enough to give them hope that they can still make the Super s.Declan Bonners side were also retaining the title for the first time since . But as this group of players look forward to the Super s in which they will be in the same group as Kerry, they will be aiming to go one better than in  and reach the All-Ireland semi-final.Cavan opted for a defensive side drafting in Ciaran Brady and Gerald Smith – who replaced corner-forwards Cian Mackey and Conor Madden. Obviously the strategy of team boss Mickey Graham was to stay in the hunt for as long as possible and then unleash more of their forward power.In the event both sides set up defensively – Cavan pulled  men behind the ball when not in possession while Donegal did one better and pulled everybody back.Read how the game unfolded:  []jsdjs.src\"embed.scribblelive widgets embed.js\"ijs"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts wattlebridge road in newtownbutler closed during security alert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is to ensure that staff welfare is protected and that the delivery of front line services is not adversely affected.\"With overall absence levels at Northern Irelands councils at their highest in   for two consecutive years and consistently ranking as the highest in the United Kingdom, with no indication of improvement, I have decided that councils could benefit from a more detailed report in this area.\"She said the Audit Office would investigate the matter more extensively.Overall, councils are in a financially strong position and managed their finances well in  , the report continued. The £m spent providing services to the public works out at £ on average for every person here.Councils received income of £m, % of which was from district rates.As of March , councils had outstanding loans totalling £.m. In   councils paid almost £m towards the principal outstanding balance and £m in interest costs.Use of agency staff not giving value for moneySome councils are still too heavily reliant on agency staff, leading to warnings that using them is not delivering value for money.In  , total employee costs totalled £m — around % of operating expenditure — with agency staff accounting for a further % .The overall cost of agency staff has continued to increase year on year, rising by £.m last year.Most of this increase was attributed to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, and Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.Agency costs at seven councils either reduced or remained relatively stable. That is an improvement on the previous year, when nine councils saw agency staff costs rise.Local government auditor Pamela McCreedy said: “In   some councils continued to be dependent on agency staff to deliver local services.“I will continue to keep the costs associated with agency staff under review across all councils, and I will also focus on the types of work they perform and theof time they have been working in the council.“There is a risk that over-reliance on agency staff over an extended period of time does not provide value for money.”Severance payouts cost £m from  to Almost £m was spent on council exit packages in the last year.Councils are required to disclose the number and costs of these payments.Expenditure includes compulsory and voluntary redundancy costs, pension contributions and other departure expenses.Over the four years from   to  ,  councils have paid a total of £.m in exit packages to staff. A total of  exit packages were agreed, with  exceeding £,.Many of the payments were linked to the reform of local government, which led to the creation of  super councils in .In   councils agreed  exit packages at a cost of £.m. The average cost was £, —  were greater than £,.The number and cost of exit packages has fallen signicantly since  .However, in the four years preceding  , the average number of exit packages was , with an average cost of £.m.Today’s report states: “The number and cost of exit packages in   remained high and is an indication that councils’ workforce plans had not stabilised.”Not one local authority ready for no-deal BrexitNo council is fully prepared for a no-deal Brexit, today’s report warns.It states the UK’s October  departure from the European Union presents a signicant risk to the operation of local government, and councils have been constrained in terms of planning.“The lack of clarity so far on the shape of an exit deal and a clear way forward, as well as the absence of additional funding, inevitably means that councils have been limited in terms of the practical preparations they can make,” the report states.“Exiting the European Union is a signicant risk to local government service delivery, in particular community planning, the economy and tourism.”Auditors found that Brexit preparations y across councils, with some establishing dedicated working groups or committees.It adds: “No council is fully ready, in operational terms, for a no-deal exit. The outworkings will have most impact on those councils which have a border with the Republic of Ireland.”The report also warns thatthe UK Government and EU fail to agree a withdrawal deal, there will be no transition period and councils will need to respond immediately."},{"url":null,"title":"we can sort out border after brexit says boris as rivals for pm lock horns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Its the UK that has the border with the Republic of Ireland and its for us to come forward with a solution that would work.\"I think everyone here would agree that what we cant have is ato border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\"Mr Hunt added that the UK needs to show that it can keep the border open. \"I think that through technology we can do that but we have to do that in a way that doesnt trap us in the customs union,\" he said.Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he was \"% committed to the Good Friday Agreement and keeping an open border\".\"In my department, Borderforce has looked at this issue and its perfectly possible to have an open border with two dferent customs arrangements on either side of the border using existing technology,\" he said - although Ms Maitlis pointed out that the existence of the technology to do so is in doubt. \"Obviously it will take time to put that in place and it will cost money. I would have a time limit on the backstop. There will have to be some sort of compromise.\"International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said that he had visited Enniskillen and Londonderry recently and argued that Mr Johnsons plans wouldnt deal with trade tarfs for farmers in border regions.Mr Johnson said that there would \"be no tarfs or quotas\" and that he wanted a \"standstill in current arrangements\" until a trade agreement was negotiated.Mr Stewart said that the Withdrawal Agreement was legally binding and would not be renegotiated before October , and accused the other candidates of not explaining how they would enact their Irish border plans.Following the answers, the questioner Mark said that there was \"a lot of fear and confusion in Northern Irelandwe come crashing out without a deal\", adding that he had been \"hoping for more\" from the candidates.The backstop aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, but opponents have claimed it could keep the UK aligned with the EU indefinitely and create a trade border in the Irish Sea.The backstop effectively ended Theresa Mays hopes of getting her Brexit deal through Parliament and its failure hastened her departure as Prime Minister.However, the EU has said it will not renegotiate the deal, which includes the backstop.Ballots of Conservative MPs will continue over the next few days to whittle the race down to the final two candidates. The final stage of the leadership race will begin and members will then vote on the next Party leader and Prime Minister, with the result expected on July ."},{"url":null,"title":"climate activist says mp who manhandled her has not apologised directly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

Augharan won Grade A ahead of nearest challengers Cullybackey while Broughshane  District won Grade B by some margin over Mountjoy and Ballyboley who had the best piping.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is a project of regional signicance and we need to be banging the drum for funding because this scheme should be the top priority for the administration. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

The application area also stretches or borders on  Areas of Special Scientic Interest from the boundaries of Belfast Lough to the glacial peat deposits of Benburb.“We have serious concerns about the impact oil and gas exploration will have on bioersity, on intensying our reliance on carbon-heavy industry and on people and communities here. “We consider this a regionally signicant application and, as such, the decision is likely to be taken by the Department for the Economy. “It is important that the Department hears and understands the strength of opposition to these proposals,” they said calling for the restoration of an Executive.Cllr O’Hanlon said: “Where we dfered with Councillor Lavery is that he sought to form a Council view in a Council Committee when the correct prcedure is to formally bring a notion of motion to Full Council.We advised Councillor Lavery of the proper process and said we would support such a motion. “The SDLP are opposed to fracking, just as we are opposed to parties trying to form council policy in the wrong manner.“Procedures are there to protect the public and good governance and we will continue to follow those rules.”NIHE offices may close and move

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
