Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini are to be suspended from midday on Friday. Officials are also reviewing a number of travel measures, including whether there should be a limited reintroduction of the use of PCR tests for arrivals. The pound hit a new 11-month low this morning, falling below $1.33 against the US dollar for the first time since last December.

Plan A remains the policy “that I think we need at this time”, Javid adds – but it’s kept under review and “if we need to go further we will”.Javid says “we don’t know enough yet”, but from what we can tell it indicates there’s a “possibility” it might have a different impact on someone if they get infected.The other four countries have been included as a “precaution”. He says “we are keeping this under review and there’s very live discussions going on” about adding further countries.He asks why these specific countries have been added and not the wider group of countries where cases of the variant have been detected, asking if they will be required to use PCR tests on arrival rather than lateral flow ones. The news today reflected a failure of the global community to distribute vaccines to low-income countries, he says. Norris adds “we need to go further and faster with vaccination at home”, adding there are “huge pockets of the country” where “significant numbers” of people remain unvaccinated. “This is a sobering reminder of the challenges that this pandemic brings,” he says.We must continue to act with caution and do all we can to keep the virus at bay, including when eligible getting your booster shot, he adds. The booster jab was already important before we knew about this new variant, he says, but now it could not be more important.Anyone not a UK or Irish resident who has been in one of these countries in the last ten days will be denied entry into England, he says. UK and Irish residents arriving from these countries from 4am on Sunday will enter hotel quarantine, he says. Anyone arriving before those dates should take PCR tests on day two and day eight, even if they are vaccinated, and isolate at home along with the rest of their household, he says. If you have arrived from any of these countries in the last ten days, Test and Trace will contact you to take PCR tests, he says. But do not wait to be contacted - you should take a PCR test right away, he adds.The UK is in a strong position thanks to reopening during the summer and the ongoing booster programme, he says. We must act with caution, he says.In South Africa, there has been exponential growth, with cases increasing four-fold in the last two weeks, he says. So while we don’t know yet definitively if the exponential growth of cases in South Africa is directly associated with this variant, this PCR test analysis does indicate that there could be many more cases than just those so far sequenced, he says.Early indications show the variant may be more transmissible than Delta, he says, and current vaccines may be less effective against it. It may also impact the effectiveness of one of our major treatments, he says.The variant has an unusually large number of mutations, he says. Yesterday, the UK Health Security Agency classified the variant as a new variant under investigation, and the Variant Technical Group has designated it as a new variant under investigation with very high priority, he says. It is the only variant with this designation, Javid says, making it higher priority than Beta.The sequence of the variant – B.1.1.529 – was first uploaded by Hong Kong from a case of someone travelling from South Africa, he says. The UK was the first to identify the threat from this new variant and alert international partners, he says.There are no detected cases in the UK at this time, he adds. But this variant is of huge international concern, he says. The WHO has called a special meeting this morning which is taking place right now, he says.There is no live press conference or anything like that planned at this moment in time, but we are expecting the outcome of the meeting to be shared with the media later today."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"big gap remains between eu and uk over brexit deal for ni says coveney","story":" Minister for Foreign Affairs  Simon Coveney: said  there was a chance ‘to seize momentum’ toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere is still “quite a big gap” between the EU and the UK in the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade rules, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said. The Minister told the Seanad Brexit committee that there was “a lot at stake over the next few weeks” given the potential “carryover” for the EU-UK trade deal to be affected if the London government decides to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol over the row.The EU has warned that the protocol and trade agreement were “inextricably linked” and that it would respond “very robustly” to the suspension of parts of the protocol under Article 16.Brussels would regard this “as a fairly serious breach of good faith,” said Mr Coveney. “That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland or in the UK,” he said.Mr Coveney said that there was a chance “to seize momentum” toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute over the protocol but that it required “a much more positive, much more stable, much more trusting EU-UK relationship.”“We have some way to go to get there,” he added.The EU and the UK are locked in negotiations in a bid to break the deadlock over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it creates a trade barrier between Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government is seeking changes to the protocol and has threatened to trigger the Article 16 clause of the protocol to suspend parts of its operation if it is not changed. Under the protocol, Northern Ireland remains under EU trade rules for goods. Mr Coveney told Independent senator Michael McDowell that the UK government’s request for all goods coming from Britain sold in Northern Ireland to be exempt from all checks and customs declarations was “a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver.” The EU can “go a long way” to reduce those checks significantly, he said, referring to the EU’s proposals to reduce food checks by 80 per cent and customs checks by 50 per cent.Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost had “shown a lot of scepticism” on whether these proposals are possible but Mr Coveney said the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic and his team were “very clear and strong” that they can deliver on those proposals. The UK “has got to give something here too”, said Mr Coveney.On the prospect of a compromise being reached, he said he was “more hopeful than I was a fortnight ago.”Mr Coveney described Lord Frost as a “good and tough negotiator” and that the British negotiating tactic has been “very successful in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU” but it has not been successful in terms of “reputation and relationships.” The Minister said the way the UK government had behaved over the last 10 months had “put a lot of strain” on relationships, between the EU and the UK, between the Ireland and the UK and, at times, between the UK and the US given the responses from the White House and Capitol Hill.However, he said he was very anxious to focus on “the limited but nevertheless limited progress of the last 10 days or so.”He said the Government wanted to maximise the opportunities in the post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the EU and UK and to develop the future relationship with the UK positively.“In order to achieve this, the parties must work together, in a spirit of partnership and trust. When trust is compromised, progress is threatened,” said Mr Coveney.“The recent UK approach to the protocol has unfortunately called that trust into question. I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum toward agreeing a constructive way forward.” How is Brexit affecting you?

In a sign of the anxiety over the threat from new variants, the UK and Israel on Thursday evening imposed travel restrictions on a group of southern African countries in response to the unusually high number of spike mutations in the new B.1.1.529 strain.The question of whether a more transmissible, more deadly or even vaccine-resistant strain could replace the dominant Delta coronavirus variant, which emerged in India late last year, is one that keeps scientists and health officials on high alert.“Has Sars-CoV-2 tried all its tricks? You’d have to be pretty cavalier to believe that,” said Gavin Screaton, an immunologist and head of Oxford university’s Medical Sciences Division.The virus is changing all the time: every replication brings new errors on the string of 30,000 nucleotides that make up its genome.Typically, these mutations fizzle out, but each one comes with the remote possibility of the virus becoming fitter, possibly enabling it to produce a higher viral load, bind more easily to cells in the airways or evade the body’s immune defences.Before Delta, the biggest threat came from the fast-spreading Alpha variant. A dozen strains have been classified as variants of “concern” or “interest” by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and given official Greek alphabet names, the latest being the Mu variant that emerged in Colombia in January.Last month, British authorities began monitoring a Delta subvariant that could be about 10 per cent more transmissible. Two more Delta descendants, found recently in Canada and Indonesia, share similarities with the strain.“It’s been largely uneventful since Alpha and Delta popped up at the tail-end of last year,” said Emma Hodcroft, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Basel who was one of the first to track mutations. “But the virus is always searching for its next move.”There is no one reason why a more dangerous variant has not emerged, although experts agree that the global vaccination campaign has helped slow the mutations.Before the vaccine rollout, the virus faced a “simpler immune landscape” in which almost everyone was susceptible and “transmissibility was the easiest win”, Ms Hodcroft explained.Now, with global first-dose coverage of more than 53 per cent and about 30 million jabs being administered globally each day, the virus’s next move was “less cut and dried”. “It could become yet more transmissible or find ways of evading our immune response - or do both,” she said.Some say transmissibility has already peaked. Francois Balloux, director of the University College London Genetics Institute, said the R0 – the reproduction number in a completely exposed population – of the endemic coronaviruses circulating before Sars-CoV-2 topped out at 7, following decades of natural selection.As Delta has an R0 of between 6 and 7 – which is more than double that of the original strain that emerged from Wuhan, China – the dominant variant may not have “much room to become more contagious in the short term”, he said.Mr Balloux predicted Sars-CoV-2 would fall into a pattern where it “slowly evolves a way around the immune system” over the course of a decade rather than “continual jumps in transmissibility”. The same, drawn-out evolution can be observed in influenza and seasonal coronaviruses.But scientists remain concerned about a sudden virus mutation, throwing the global pandemic response and the vaccination drive off course.The B.1.1.529 strain, which is spreading in South Africa as well as Botswana, has raised concerns for this reason, as many of its 32 mutations are associated with the ability to evade the immune system and spread faster.The WHO has convened an emergency meeting on Friday, where it is expected to classify the strain as a variant of interest, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.Tulio de Oliveira, director of the Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation in South Africa, said he was “worried” about the variant and that it was the cause of about 90 per cent of the roughly 1,100 virus cases registered on Wednesday in Gauteng province. Slawomir Kubik, a genomics research expert at Geneva-based biotech Sophia Genetics, stressed that the “fitness” of a variant can only be judged by how it “spreads in the real world”.“It’s about the genes, the environment and a degree of luck . . . if you have an ‘advantageous’ mutation but never pass it on, it will never spread,” he said.Even if the Botswana strain fades, others will emerge. Venky Soundararajan, chief scientist at Nference, a data analytics company, worried that an effect of the inoculation drive could be to force the virus down “genetic cul-de-sacs”, spawning an “escape variant” capable of evading the immune system.“Vaccines are a godsend in their ability to stop infections and severe disease, but paradoxically they also increase the need for us to monitor for these very specific, targeted mutations,” he said.Although no one can be sure where and when a dominant variant will emerge, there is scientific consensus that Delta will not remain in the ascendancy forever.Kevin McCarthy, professor of microbiology and microgenetics at the University of Pittsburgh, said the virus’s evolution was “nearing a tipping point” after which the odds would favour an escape variant.“Will we move to something where the virus alters its antigenicity and erodes vaccine efficacy? I think that’s likely to happen,” he said. “If the virus is faced with the binary choice of evolving or going extinct, it will evolve.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"bame label crudely conflates ethnic groups should scrapped research","story":"The term “BAME” should be scrapped as it “erases identities”, NHS-backed research has concluded.The NHS Race and Health Observatory launched a four-week consultation with the public in July on how best to collectively refer to people from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups.The independent body, set up and supported by the NHS to tackle health inequalities, has formally committed to never use the blanket acronym after feedback to its consultation said it was not representative.The Observatory said it has become the norm in public policy to use initialisms to refer to a hugely erse group of people, but that renewed scrutiny has been spurred on by the Black Lives Matter movement.It said terminology that crudely conflates different groups does not just erase identities, it can also lead to broad brush policy decisions that fail to appreciate the nuance of ethnic inequality in the UK.Generic collective terms such as BAME, BME and ethnic minority are not representative or universally popular, the Observatory said, after receiving responses from 5,104 people.It found no single, collective umbrella term to describe ethnic groups was agreed by the majority of respondents.The body had previously said it was committed to avoiding the use of acronyms and initialisms, but has now formalised this as one of five key principles it is adopting in its communications.It is understood NHS England has also moved away from using the term “BAME”.The Observatory report gave no recommendations for other organisations to drop the acronym, but said it recommended groups should “have their own conversations about language”.Where possible the Observatory will be specific about the ethnic groups it is referring to, but where collective terminology is necessary it will always be guided by context and not adopt a blanket term.It said it will remain adaptable and open to changing its approach to language.The survey found ethnic minority was the least unpopular collective term, with equal proportions feeling unhappy and happy with it (37.9 per cent).Some 30 per cent of respondents were happy with the term BAME.Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the Observatory, said: The communities we engage and work with needed to be at the centre of these broad conversations before the Observatory took a final decision on its own approach towards terminology use.We hope that the proposed principles will help others to reflect on their own approaches to language use.This is not the end of the conversation as we remain open to revisit preferences over time.White British people made up the largest group of respondents - 38.2 per cent of the total - but their responses were not counted when questions were asked about feeling comfortable about collective terms for non-White British groups.The Observatory also held five focus groups with around 100 participants over September and October.Annette Hay, chairman of Coventry University Race Equality Council, said the discussion had been very timely and much needed.She said: I found the discussion very dynamic and engaging because, like many others, it is something that I have personally battled with and against for a long time now.There were some very compelling arguments for and against the use of various phrases, acronyms and terminology, most of which seemed to reinforce the need for more conversations and consultations, so that we might find new and more nuanced ways of referencing, describing and analysing, typically marginalised and minoritised groups.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Sajid Javid says there are no UK cases of new variantChannel migrants latest news: Boris Johnson is not handling current crisis \u0026#39seriously\u0026#39, claims Emmanuel MacronFour teenagers arrested on suspicion of murdering 12-year-old girl in LiverpoolHow to show proof of Covid vaccination status for travel abroadWatch: Women sprayed in the face with tear gas as they clash with police in TurkeyIt\u0026#39s easy to be cynical, but we are quietly making a success of BrexitMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"minister had carried home drink spiked night","story":"A minister who claims she was spiked at a bar has called on the Home Secretary to tackle the issue.Mims Davies, the Conservative MP for Mid Sussex, said she was on a night out in Haywards Heath in 2019 when she noticed a dark substance in her drink.While she initially dismissed it, she said she later blacked out and had to be carried home to safety. She described it as an absolutely awful experience.“I found something black in the bottom of my drink. I pulled it out and didn’t really think anything of it, and threw it on the floor, she told the BBC.“It was only later on I thought: ‘Blimey, what was that?\u0027 It was absolutely awful. I had to be carried home.”The employment minister has now written to the Home Secretary to ask what further measures can be taken to prevent spiking.“We should be restricting who on earth can get hold of these products, as we would in any other sphere, she said.“What on earth is in those products? Who’s buying them and who’s sourcing them? There’s more to this than meets the eye.”There have been hundreds of reports of spiking in the UK in recent months, a crime the Home Secretary has described as “horrendous”.Last month, she asked police chiefs for an urgent update on the scale of the problem and demanded to know what was being done to better protect women.Rachel Maclean, another MP, told the House of Commons on Wednesday that drink-spiking was a “horrific and frightening offence”.The Alcohol Education Trust estimates that hundreds of people are victims of drink-spiking each year, where drugs - such as GHB - or alcohol are added without their knowledge.A spokesman for the Home Office said it is “dedicating local and national resources” to dealing with the “extremely disturbing” crime.Last weekend, a Pitcher and Piano bar in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was temporarily closed by police after seven people reported being spiked on the premises in the early hours of Sunday morning.A Home Office spokesman said: “These reports are extremely disturbing. We are pleased to see that the police are taking this issue seriously and dedicating both local and national resources to investigating it.“We remain in close contact with the police on this issue and the Home Secretary is receiving regular updates.“We must now give the police the space to conduct their enquiries, and we would urge anyone with information on these incidents to contact their local force.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Sajid Javid says there are no UK cases of new variantChannel migrants latest news: Boris Johnson is not handling current crisis \u0026#39seriously\u0026#39, claims Emmanuel MacronFour teenagers arrested on suspicion of murdering 12-year-old girl in LiverpoolHow to show proof of Covid vaccination status for travel abroadWatch: Women sprayed in the face with tear gas as they clash with police in TurkeyIt\u0026#39s easy to be cynical, but we are quietly making a success of BrexitMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nerdiness making comeback time","story":"“How ridiculous,” tutted my husband as we drove past.

I clung on perhaps too long to the hope that the EU would reform. But what really tipped it for me was the vision sold by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and others: that we’d swap a parochial European policy for a world of “Global Britain”. So not “drawbridge up”, but “out, and into the world”.It’s a testable thesis. If correct, then Britain would visibly rewire itself and strike bold trade deals to deepen links with far-flung allies. We’d repair old alliances and strike up a new relationship with Europe. We’d kill populism at home and have stable government in Westminster. We’d strengthen the Union, with Brexit making Scottish independence unworkable. Less red tape would mean more freedom to liberalise, innovate and grow – moving away from the EU’s failing model.I was recalling this earlier this week at the Margaret Thatcher conference – sponsored by the Daily  – held just before the Prime Minister joined for dinner and made a second attempt at his Peppa Pig speech. I chaired a debate between Vince Cable and Dan Hannan, who hold similar views on trade but differ on Europe. Hannan spoke – as he always does – with the infectious energy of a revivalist preacher, filling the hall with the Brexity optimism that carried the vote five years ago. Cable was in “I told you so” Remoaner mode. It was time to see who was right.My main quarrel was with Hannan. Where are these sunlit uplands? What happened to us staying close to Europe? The latest figures show our service exports to the EU falling twice as fast as those to the rest of the world, although the pandemic skews everything. But the idea of Britain becoming the EU’s single best ally has taken a bit of a knock after the vaccine wars and Northern Ireland rows.And those new alliances? We can all cheer Liz Truss as she Instagrams her way around the world working on dozens of trade deals. If you’re a Brexiteer you can even suspend disbelief by not looking too closely at the nature of those deals. But if you do, you see the flaw: most of them are rolled-over EU agreements. Where new ground is broken, Brexit Britain seems to be treading with terrified caution.Take the Australian deal – which has yet to be signed. It ought to be huge: Australia is the perfect partner with whom we share a language, a sovereign and much more. But our new trade deal with them is being phased in over 15 years, as if free trade is a huge threat from which Britain needs to be protected. We needed a far-shorter timetable offering immediate visa-free access for Aussies: we need skilled workers to fill our vacancies. This is what global Britain is supposed to be about.In public, ministers talk as if Britain is now the world’s free-trading superstar. The new Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, was denouncing protectionism as a giant evil just a few days ago. But inside the Government, Tory protectionists are ready to swoop – warning about growth hormones injected into Australian cows or (one of Michael Gove’s favourites) the chlorine wash used on American chickens. Such arguments take place behind closed doors and, to a depressing extent, the protectionists win.Take, for example, the row a few weeks ago over steel imports. The Trade Remedies Authority, set up to “defend UK economic interests” from unfair competition, wanted to abolish surcharges on tin cans and other imports. A dull case, but a good test for the basic notion of free trade. British steelmakers protested, and the Prime Minister had to take sides – so he went with the protectionists. It was the first test case for the new free-trade watchdog and doesn’t bode well.Look around and you can see all kinds of Brexit opportunities not being taken. We are now free to ditch the notorious GDPR rules which (among many other bureaucratic burdens) ask everyone who visits any website to read a legalistic warning. No one in Whitehall can see the point of all this, but it’s still here. The EU Mortgage Credit Directive no longer controls our mortgage market. But the old credit rules are still in place, locking some 170,000 homeowners into higher interest rates than they need to pay.As chancellor, George Osborne tried to sue the EU to stop it imposing a cap on bankers’ bonuses – seeing it as an attack on the City of London’s power. Brexit brings freedom to abolish this cap, but it’s still there. Scrapping it might look a bit too much like action. Meanwhile, the EU tries to lure more bankers away from London and into its single market.David Frost, the Brexit minister, is struggling to hide his frustration with all this. He has fought as hard as anyone in government for a clean Brexit deal. He fights still, over the Northern Ireland Protocol, but even seems to be wondering what the fighting is for if the Brexit freedoms are never going to be used. He closed the Thatcher conference by saying that the recipe for a country’s success is well-known: regulatory restraint and low taxes. He didn’t need to point out that the Tories are lifting taxes to a 71-year high.His other point was more candid. Invoking the language of Thatcher’s Bruges speech, he said that Britain had not rolled back the frontiers of the European Union “only to import that European model”. But this is, quite clearly, what he thinks is happening now: that Britain is ending up with the opposite of what many of Brexit’s architects hoped to create.As a force for political stability, Brexit (eventually) delivered. Britain is now one of the few countries in Europe with no populists in parliament. Leaving the EU did not, in the end, supercharge the case for Scottish independence. But the idea of Brexit exerting its own gravitational pull – dragging taxes down and pushing trade up – is starting to look like a fantasy.If speeches in the House of Commons are anything to go by, there is no end of Tories who think Global Britain was more than a sound bite and that Britain does deserve a future of free trade and low taxes. It will be up to them to steer their government – and their Prime Minister – in this direction.More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Sajid Javid says there are no UK cases of new variantChannel migrants latest news: Boris Johnson is not handling current crisis \u0026#39seriously\u0026#39, claims Emmanuel MacronFour teenagers arrested on suspicion of murdering 12-year-old girl in LiverpoolHow to show proof of Covid vaccination status for travel abroadWatch: Women sprayed in the face with tear gas as they clash with police in TurkeyIt\u0026#39s easy to be cynical, but we are quietly making a success of BrexitMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"right wingers have much sense humour left","story":"Cast your mind back to the summer of 2020 and you might recall having a good laugh online at the antics of a rogue Downing Street adviser. He wore louchely unbuttoned Oxford shirts, deludedly felt he had the ear of the Prime Minister, clearly thought himself above regular people, coined mildly offensive nicknames for the residents of No 10 and adored the sound of his own voice.Heady days – but Dominic Cummings wasn’t the only one. At the same time, as the Government lurched from crisis to scandal to u-turn, there was another adviser – mercifully fictional but otherwise matching the same description – entertaining the locked-down masses on social media.He was Rafe Hubris – or, to give him his proper title, Rafe Hubris, BA (Oxon) – and he was the creation of 25-year-old comedian Josh Berry. Every time a political gaffe occurred, up popped Berry as the insufferably entitled Hubris, pretending to advise the hapless minister in trouble that he could spin them out of it.“Blojo!” he’d often intone in the videos, phone clamped to an ear, “how are we?” That’s probably about all I can reproduce here, but suffice to say that each one served as a neat and perfectly observed skewering of not just the current administration, but the culture of over-familiar, self-important special advisers too.“It all started when Michael Gove tweeted Stormzy’s own lyrics at him, do you remember that?” Berry says. That happened during the general election in 2019 when, during an online row over the rapper’s political views, Gove posted: “I set trends, dem man copy.”“I just remember thinking, God, that’s so tone deaf. Who would advise him to do that? Because someone would have. And I’ve been around those people, they’re exactly the sort of people I’d have seen in a club...”As an Oxford graduate who did at least one of the Ps in PPE, Berry had to do little more than recall the boat-shod, gilet-wearing characters he met in smoking areas at university in order to research the part. “Yes, it was just that. I’ve been researching it all my life, without realising it. The nasal voice was essential, but everyone has come across a Rafe at some point, haven’t they?”The pandemic provided fertile soil for satirical comics on social media. Not only were we stuck inside mindlessly scrolling in search of a distraction from all that was going on in the world, but the Government provided those comedians fodder on a daily basis. Matt Hancock certainly did. (A recent rumour that the former health secretary is planning a book entitled “How I Won the Covid War” – given that Berry has published one as Hubris called Staggering Hubris: The Rona Years, Vol 1 – has caused him much enjoyment.)“It was a gift for a comedian, this whole pandemic. Hancock is a walking caricature of a man, he just gets butchered. It’s almost a pantomime cast, certainly when Cummings and Hancock were around. It doesn’t take much work to repurpose that into comedy.”In a west London pub, near to where he rents a flat with some friends, Berry is engaging, slightly bashful company. He’s also alarmingly tall, given most people have only seen the top half of him on Twitter. “Yes, a lot of people say that,” he says, stooping to enter the room, “it’s like meeting your Zoom colleagues for the first time.”Berry’s videos as Hubris – including an all too easy ribbing of Peppa Pig-gate this week – would regularly receive more than 100,000 views and won him fans from all over the political spectrum. The pandemic, he says, was “very helpful, because there was less ision of opinion, which made it easier to play off a set of jokes”.When everyone’s in agreement on a topic, it’s easy to mock it. It’s partly why Berry was surprised when US comedian Dave Chapelle wrote and performed controversial material for a Netflix special about the trans debate. “There doesn’t seem to be a unified truth on that. It’s a murky discussion where people haven’t worked out what they think and that makes it hard to do comedy, irrespective of what you think of his opinions,” he says.Berry already knows how it feels to have a Twitter mob rise up against him. In his armoury of characters, he also has a Bristol student, “Trustafarian” (a young person who presents as a paragon of counterculture despite being supported by their parents), who mocks drug culture and the hard Left. Earlier this year, one – admittedly not brilliantly executed – skit saw this character attend the “Kill the Bill” protests against the Government’s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill. That one didn’t go down very well.“The critique was that it was ‘punching down’, which I thought was absurd. To use Marxist language, it was a parody of the bourgeoisie pretending to be the proletariat, which was lost, I think, on Twitter,” Berry says. “It was all said from a Left-wing perspective – I agree with the right to protest, it was just a critique of middle-class privilege…” He looks a bit exasperated. “I was just trying to be funny, but with comedy, people get so cross.”At the time, Berry logged off for a while, as people attacked him from all angles and pointed out that he is himself privileged – a fact Berry is acutely aware of, to the extent that it makes up the backbone of his stand-up routines. Then he remembered that Twitter is not a real place, and came to the conclusion that with some people you just can’t win.“The hard Left don’t like being mocked, they don’t like laughing at themselves, in a way that the Right really do. I think the Right have much more of a sense of humour, and take criticism quite well. Boris Johnson goes on Have I Got News For You, Jacob Rees-Mogg does stuff like that… The Left doesn’t seem to have that ability.”Incidentally, Berry is quite posh, or at least looks it – “I have a particularly posh face,” he laments, accurately, to the photographer. The son of a teacher and accountant, he was born in Crewe but grew up in Reading, attending the same private school his mum taught at, before reading philosophy and theology at Oxford.He broke into comedy by doing such spot-on impressions of tennis players that he caught the attention of Andy Murray, who tweeted a video of Berry’s, launching him onto the radar of Dead Ringers at just 21. He’s been doing impressions, stand-up and character work ever since.“If you look at the first bit of my life, it’s quite different to how it looks now. My parents were orced, I grew up in a semi-detached house with my mum, and then now it’s like: ‘Oxford graduate living in West Kensington’” he says, laughing.Berry now has people shout catchphrases at him in the street – or one anyway, the nasal, “How are we?” – and doesn’t find it annoying yet. But some do. “I’ve had people who went to Eton get quite upset that he’s a parody of an Etonian, and I just think: ‘Why?’ I guess posh people are quite sensitive.”If anything, that’s what he’s trying to get across with Rafe: that maybe the country shouldn’t always be run by people hired because of where they were educated and who they knew.“Oxbridge deserves a lot of mockery, ” Berry reckons, momentarily getting serious, and not least because “the sort of institution that can teach you to be confident without necessarily being that rigorous... isn’t maybe the best thing in the world.”Still, he won’t grumble too much. As long as the Eton and Oxbridge factory lines keep pumping, he’ll never be short of material.Staggering Hubris by Josh Berry (Lightning Books) is out now, and available to buy for £8.99 at books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514More from NewsCoronavirus latest news: Sajid Javid says there are no UK cases of new variantChannel migrants latest news: Boris Johnson is not handling current crisis \u0026#39seriously\u0026#39, claims Emmanuel MacronFour teenagers arrested on suspicion of murdering 12-year-old girl in LiverpoolHow to show proof of Covid vaccination status for travel abroadWatch: Women sprayed in the face with tear gas as they clash with police in TurkeyIt\u0026#39s easy to be cynical, but we are quietly making a success of BrexitMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"easy cynical quietly making success brexit","story":"Sir Robert Peel once remarked that public opinion is a compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs. I’m not so cynical, but any of us who followed the Brexit debate over the last few years could certainly see his views reflected in some of the downbeat corners of the media. All too often, the negative angle taken about our leaving the European Union can feel pessimistic, particularly for those of us who see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to regain our nation’s sovereignty. Our successes are often denied the space they deserve, while challenges — real or imagined — are seized upon and blown up into headlines. For the first time in fifty years, the United Kingdom is an independent trading nation with a government answerable only to the British people. Any big change brings challenges, yes, but to focus solely on them is not only wrong, but means that our tangible successes don’t get a look-in.One area that often flies under the radar is the work we’re doing to open up markets all around the world, beyond trade deals.As we said when launching our Export Strategy last week, research shows firms that export are more productive, more profitable and pay higher wages on average than those that don’t. And there is, understandably, huge appetite for high-quality British goods and services worldwide, making it mutually beneficial. That’s why the Department for International Trade is working flat out to give British businesses the opportunity to sell their brilliant goods and services around the planet more easily than ever before — positioning us to take advantage of the markets of tomorrow and unleashing the UK\u0027s full potential.  That means cutting through unnecessary red tape and working with our trading partners across the world to set the conditions in which British businesses can thrive. This can be tricky, and it can take some time. But, for the country, it’s worth it.   Last year, we opened up access for major names like Diageo and Waitrose, as well as iconic Jersey dairy products and Scotch whisky. We clarified labelling requirements to achieve greater access to Jordan’s £2.5 billion food import market, and worked with Indian counterparts to increase permitted investment in their insurance market by a whopping 25 per cent, supporting British firms to grow their share of a market worth over £4 billion.  In Colombia, we worked with authorities to support development of ambitious environmental regulations that will support green investments from British firms. In Japan, we helped ensure British sausages could be marketed and sold appropriately.   The list goes on. I’m proud to say that figures published yesterday show we successfully resolved a total of 217 trade barriers across 74 countries – up 20 per cent on last year’s total. So much for the doubters, doomsters and gloomsters.  We must never forget just how much the UK has to offer as the world’s second largest services exporter and fifth largest economy. We have agreed trade deals with 70 countries — plus the EU — worth £766 billion. No other nation has secured so many trade deals with so many of its counterparts in such a short space of time. And this is just the beginning. We are making headway in dynamic economies around the world, and we have shaken hands on agreements with our good friends in Australia and New Zealand.   This paves the way for our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (sometimes called CPTPP), a truly enormous free trade area with a combined GDP well in excess of £8 trillion last year. This Indo-Pacific tilt will hitch us to a fast-growing, dynamic region that we could do so much more with. We’re making great progress in our ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. And we are preparing to begin trade negotiations with India, which is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2050.  The opportunities available to a newly independent United Kingdom are all but limitless.

but said new restrictions cannot be ruled out.Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Prof Finn said he was unable to predict whether the emergence of the variant could affect Christmas.He said: “On the one hand, I don’t want to induce unnecessary anxiety in people, but on the other hand, I think we all need to be ready for the possibility of a change in the restrictions.”Prof Finn said that a rise in cases in South Africa, where the variant originated, could be linked to the variant’s enhanced transmissibility.He said: “We now need to wait and see just what kind of threat this new variant may pose.“If we’re lucky, it won’t be a serious one, but it could be very serious.”He added that sequencing is being carried out across the UK to determine whether any cases of the variant have already been imported.“There are a number of things going on now to understand this, to look for it, to trace it, to hopefully stamp it out if it is already here”, he said.The Government placed six African countries on a new travel red list yesterday evening amid concerns about the variant.South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and Lesotho will be placed on the red-list, meaning travellers from those countries will have to spend 10 days in a quarantine hotel.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said the new variant “may be more transmissible” than the delta variant and added “the vaccines that we currently have may be less effective”.Asked what the new variant meant for Britain in the run up to Christmas, Mr Javid said: We\u0027ve got plans in place, as people know, for the spread of this infection here in the UK and we have contingency plans – the so-called Plan B.”Dr Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today Programme that the new variant is the most complex and worrying seen thus far.She said: The first look at it shows it has a variety of different mutations, it\u0027s got 30 different mutations that seem relevant, that\u0027s double what we had in Delta.And if you look at those mutations as mutations that increase infectivity, mutations that evades the immune response, both from vaccines and natural immunity, mutations that cause increased transmissibility, it\u0027s a highly complex mutation, there\u0027s new ones we haven\u0027t seen before, so we don\u0027t know how they\u0027re going to interact in common.So all of this makes it a pretty complex, challenging variant and I think we will need to learn a lot more about it before we can say for definite its definitely the most complex variant before.She added: It is the most worrying we\u0027ve seen.The B.1.1.529 variant has been found in 77 cases in South Africa, four in Botswana, and one in Hong Kong, in a patient who had recently visited South Africa. More from NewsChannel migrants latest news: Boris Johnson is not handling current crisis \u0026#39seriously\u0026#39, claims Emmanuel MacronCoronavirus latest news: Sajid Javid addresses MPs amid fears of new variant -

Jess Phillips, Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, has hit out at the Government on White Ribbon Day - an international campaign started by men in London in the s. She told the Mirror: “Time and time again the government has failed to act with the urgency that this epidemic of violence against women and girls needs. The fear and abuse that so many women and girls face on a daily basis is not inevitable – there are many policies and legislative changes, that are ready to be rolled out today, that would save lives. Yet the government continues to reject or ignore them. “Enough is enough.Here is the full list of Labour ’s proposals that the government have rejected or ignored:A seven-year minimum sentence for rape. Conservative MPs blocked an amendment to the Police and Crime Sentencing Bill to introduce this.A minimum jail term for stalking. As it stands, there is still no minimum custodial term for stalking. Courts can impose sentences of up to six months. If the stalking includes the victim being made to fear violence, the maximum sentence is  years. Statutory defences for survivors of domestic abuse who are driven to offend due to the abuse suffered. Making street harassment a crime . The Government has so far refused to do this, with Boris Johnson said to believe current laws are sufficient. Fast tracking rape and serious sexual assault cases through the courts. The Government is looking at how cases can be brought forward more quickly but has not committed to this. Make misogyny a hate crime. The Government has so far refused to do this, with Boris Johnson said to believe current laws are sufficient. Forcing local authorities to back a strategies to prevent and reduce to end violence against women. The Home Office has put out a directive that gives violence against women and girls the same status as terrorism, but this has not been put on a statutory footing for councils. Whole le tarfs for those who rape, abduct and murder a person. It is possible for judges to hand down this sentence where someone is convicted but it is not the minimum term. Making the offer of apossex for rentapos a crime. The Government has underlined that the Sex Offences Act bans inciting prostitution for gain but securing a prosecution for offering apossex for rentapos requires the victim to identy as a prostitute. Labour wants to create a specic offence that puts the responsibility with the landlord. Jail terms of  years for those who name victims of rape and sexual assault. Former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said he was looking at raising the sentence from six months to two years, but the move has yet to be confirmed. Training all professionals dealing with rape victims on rape myths and stereotypes . The Government has not committed to doing this. Boosting Specialist Domestic Violence Courts , to monitor offenders . The Government has not yet committed to doing this. A statutory duty on courts to recognise independent sexual violence advisors and independent domestic violence advisors. The Government has yet to back this policy, despite advisors having a close relationship with victims. Free and independent legal advice and representation for victims . A service has been piloted in the Northumbria Police area but not introduced nationally. Offering legal aid in domestic abuse cases without means testing. Public finding for domestic abuse cases is limited and victims say homes, often a source of disputes with the perpetrator, are used as capital in means-testing. Make prosecution work for Rape and Serious Sexual Offences a named permanent specialism within the CPS. The Government has not yet committed to this.Rape and Serious Sexual Offences in local police forces and training on specic issues faced by Black, Asian, minority ethnic, LGBT+, disabled and migrant women.The Government has not committed to this.A statutory ‘firewall’ to stop cops sharing a domestic abuse victimaposs immigration details of victims with the Home Office. As it stands, this is not protected information between cops and the Home Office. Monitoring serial domestic abusers and stalkers, and recording offences on a register. A new category for such offences is yet to be created. Strengthening laws to protect kids and parents from abusive adults. As it stands, the Children Act presumes the involvement of a parent will further a child’s welfare. Labour wants a new framework that takes into account when there has been evidence of domestic abuse to the child or other parent. Stop parents awaiting trial or bail for domestic abuse having unsupervised contact with kids. Labour says it must be ensured that all child contact centres have to be accredited. Create a VAWG Bill and measure the progress made. In its VAWG Bill, Labour would replicate and build on provisions under sectionof the Violence Against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual ViolenceAct , meaning Ministers must publish indicators that can be applied for the purpose of measuring progress towards the achievement of the purpose of the Act. Bring in new national indicators to also reflect the intersectional nature victims. The impact on Black, Asian and ethnic minority, LGBT+, disabled and migrant women should be monitored. Set a deadline for the violence against women treaty. Set out a clear, strict timetable of completing outstanding actions needed to raty the Istanbul Convention in full.Create a stand-alone ministerial position on VAWG . Labour says oversight is needed solely for rape and sexual violence survivors. And a commitment to a cross departmental approach involving the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office, the Attorney General’s Office, and public health departments is needed. All victims in the UK should be able to access housing. Ensure that provisions under the Immigration Acts – including exclusion from public funds, certain types of support and assistance and the right to rent – do not apply to survivors of domestic abuse. Ensure landlords provide adequate housing for victims. Review the granting of enhanced housing benefit to providers of aposexempt accommodationapos targeted at domestic abuse victims and ensure that unscrupulous providers or landlords cannot profit from the provision of substandard or inappropriate accommodation. All authorities must be able to help victims. Place a duty on all relevant public authorities to commission specialist domestic abuse support services for all persons affected by domestic abuse. Long term financial settlements. Labour has called for multi-year financial settlements so support service providers can plan for the long-term. Labour would introduce specic funding streams to support specialist services for migrant victims, Black, Asian and ethnic minority victims, LGBT+ victims and disabled victims. Bolster teacher training on helping child victims. The Government must ensure there is training for teachers to help identy, respond to and support child victims of domestic abuse. Hold national data on sexual harassment in schools, colleges and universities . As it stands, only national polls set out harassment that has took place within education systems. The Government say these matters are to be dealt with by police. Review safeguarding inspections at schools. Labour has called for a review of the inspections process. The Government set up a review into sexual abuse in schools, but have not reached a conclusion on how kids can be protected before they are assaulted. Repeal the rape clause for social security claims. In , the Tories introduced measures changes to Universal Credit, which was then Child Tax Credit. The Government has been accused of forcing victims of rape to prove they have been raped in order to receive child benefits. This has not been changed despite mounting fury. Review single payments for Universal Credit. For women enduring domestic abuse, single household payments can be problematic. Abusive partners may control their partner with financial abuse. The APPG on Universal Credit found % of women said their partner was financially controlling during the pandemic. Labour is calling on the Government to make it swter to separate funds for each partner. End the five weeks wait for Universal Credit payment, to ensure domestic abuse survivors can access the support they need quickly. Campaigners have noted, domestic abusers use child contact as a means to continue controlling their partners, even once they have fled. The five weeks wait between a UC claim and receiving the benefit limits women’s ability to support themselves and their children as they rebuild their lives. Collect and review Parliament data on child deaths involving homicide. The NSPCC believes data currently underestimates how many children have died due to abuse or neglect because it is legal tricky to prove home, the cause of death can be misdiagnosed and sometimes it is left unexplained. Domestic abuse victims must be able to get legal aid   free legal advice before anyone can scan their electronic devices for evidence of abuse. Protect disabled victims of domestic abuse. Labour have called on the Government to extend the definition of ‘personally connected’ in the Domestic Abuse Act. Protect disabled victims from carers in law . Labour has called on the Government to remove the legal defence that enables a carerwas ‘acting in best interests’ in coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship. Child domestic abuse victims on school or NHS waiting lists. If a child is moved for safety purposes as a result of domestic abuse, this won’t affect children on NHS waiting lists or school admission lists. Assess how benefits cuts affect survivors. Labour believes the Government has a duty to assess the impact of welfare reforms on survivors of domestic abuse. No review has been conducted. Time off for domestic abuse victims. Provision of  days leave from employment for victims of domestic abuse, the Government are yet to act on this. Perpetrator programmes to be of a quality-assured standard. A mandatory Domestic Abuse Protection Orderreview process. We need to see a transparent and thorough review of DAPOs with expert and lived experience input before a national roll out. It is essential for this review to have input from the Domestic Abuse and Victim’s Commissioners, specialist domestic abuse sector and survivors, and that this review is given appropriate consideration before any national roll out. Protect victim’s locations. The government must roll out court orders so refuge locations cannot be revealed, leaving abusers to find out where a victim is. Brain health for domestic abuse cases . Labour says mandatorybrain injury screening should take place for Domestic Abuse cases and female prisoners. Domestic abuse victims should not need a ‘local connection’ when applying for social housing . Labour has called for the ‘local connection’ need to be removed as victims should be able to escape to any borough. Support victims on joint tenancies. Facilitating the removal of one joint tenant from a tenancy agreement where there has been domestic or other violence. Bail for violence against women and girls. The initial bail period for cases of domestic abuse should be extended from  days to  months. Protect women and girls from indecent exposure. Review the law around exposure , under section  of the Sexual Offences Act A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Our Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will protect women and girls by keeping the most serious sexual and violent offenders locked up for even longer.

I thought applying to the Home Office would be less political, less contentious, more organised and more impactful. But little did I know. I joined the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and after signing the Official Secrets Act, I settled into the MP and Ministerial Correspondence ision. This was a dynamic unit which gave me a good ground for future work and challenges ahead. This ranged from visa to passports, from asylum to human rights, from international students to the UK labour market. What I learned is that asylum seekers fleeing certain countries are never ed, due mainly to British economic interest in that country, the type of political regime, or because ing an asylum seeker would cause embarrassment to the sovereign of that country, no matter questionable their human rights practices. Some asylum seekers are officially designated stateless. People flee their home countries for a number of reasons, and when I interviewed asylum seekers as part of their application, many, believe it or not, would rather stay in their home countriesthe basic necessities of le - food, shelter and clothing - could be met for them and their children. Asylum seekers often talk about mining in their villages and the pollution it brings to the water, the babies born with deformities and the appalling working conditions their partners have to endure. Their government may have no financial muscle to challenge the foreign-owned companies and there are no labour laws. The over-mining helps contributes to the climate crisis, and when minerals and resources dry up, Western companies just pack their bags and leave. We know of one famous prime minster whose son was implicated in a coup in an African country – he simply picked up his bags and boarded a plane. Then there is terrorism. Asylum seekers were often extremely nervous, traumatised and bordering on the psychotic during my interviews with them , recalling the horrors of their journeys and their homes and community being burnt to the ground by insurgents. Sometimes even their child’s school, despite them not being involved in any religious or political movement. Asylum seekers can also be political prisoners or prisoners of conscience – simply for expressing a view. You can be tortured, raped, murdered, evenyour family member has a political view and not you. According to the International Organisation for Migrationsince , over , asylum seekers and migrants have died or disappeared in the Mediterranean Sea alone.  Why do they come  Asylum seekers often say the UK has a long tradition of welcoming people fleeing dangerous or totalitarian states. They say they believe their rights will be respected – whether they have £, or £ in the bank. That there is a court system, judiciary, and a trial – rather than an execution. They admire our fight for equality, fairness and social justice. Above all, asylum seekers say they believe they will have dignity.  There is a distinction between asylum seekers and refugees. An asylum seeker is just that – anyone fleeing persecution or death and seeking safety in another country. A refugee is someone who has actually been granted refugee status – meaning their claim has been fully assessed, usually via medical reports and reports in their country of origin and found to be genuine. Refugees are then granted asylum or humanitarian protection. At times this can be for a limited time to see whether the situation in their home country improves. So there is no automatic “open door” of asylum seekers as is the common perception. If a claim fails, asylum seekers are ed to Third Countries where we have an agreement - a safe country they have passed through on their way to the UK. We had a department in the Home Office dedicated to this known as the Third Country Unit. Most European countries are part of this agreement and signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.  However, since we have left the EU, we cannotany asylum seeker to a Third Country. Own goal. Our government has signalled that it will also pull out of the ECHR. The UK again will not get the cooperation it seeks, and asylum seekers will not get the protection they deserve. Another own goal. An important strategy in the asylum crisis was that asylum seekers were able to apply for asylum at any British Embassy or High Commission in their home country with whatever documentation they had or none. Their claim would be assessed by embassy staff and intelligence officials and a decision would be made in a matter of months – not years as it is now today. No one wins in these scenarios. Not the taxpayer and certainly not the asylum seeker. This was a safe, sensible route and would often negate the contentious issue of an asylum seeker’s age. In its wisdom, the government decided to discontinue that system. Yet another own goal. The government has imposed hefty fines on lorries crossing the Channelan asylum seeker is found, and also the airline industry. Checks are now overzealous in these sectors. The only route left for asylum seekers are small unsafe boats - sometimes inflatable dinghies with little protection from the wind and waves. If a solution isn’t found fast, I fear many more will perish in the English Channel.

But who will go with them  Boris Johnson is under mounting pressure to stage a “diplomatic boycott” of the February event.He is said to be “pondering” the idea, which means he can’t make up his mind, as usual. Such a move would mean no British royals or politicians going to Beijing, in protest at the dictatorial rule of the Chinese Communist Party, and its repression of Uighur people. MPs unanimously passed a boycott motion, and so has the European ­Parliament. US President Joe Biden faces similar demands from US lawmakers.It’s all turning rather nasty, in true Olympic spirit. Complacent sports supremo Lord Seb Coe thinks snubbing Beijing would be a mistake, while an alliance of human rights groups insists the boycott must go ahead.Sanctions can bring about political change. The long sporting boycott of South Africa helped to accelerate the death of apartheid. But that was a stayaway by sportsmen and women, not just the great and the good.

After two-and-a-half years in Downing Street, he has failed to fix the migrant crisis while his Home Secretary Priti Patel condemns her own department as “not fit for purpose”. Her civil servants call her a “moron” and an “idiot”, a slur on all decent morons and idiots. This isn’t government. It’s student politics, playing with people’s lives. They promise action, but nothing ever happens. Why don’t they set up reception centres in France to deal with applications for refugee status in the UK  Those who succeed can come in. Those who fail can seek asylum in France or another EU country, as most do already. If they fail both tests, they can legally be ed to their country of origin. This issue is fast becoming number one on the political agenda. Tory MPs fear it could cost them the next election. Patel will never “take back control” of our borders. The bullying Home Secretary can’t even control her temper. Johnson should sack her and take back control of the chaos he calls his government. ****** Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raabsays: “We flagellate ourselves too much.” Quite right.

The Home Secretary is travelling with Home Office officials and law enforcement officers to Paris on Friday “to intensy joint co-operation and intelligence-sharing”. Ms Patel appears to have had a change of heart after she initially said it is mostly up to French officials to stop refugees crossing the Channel. After  people were pronounced dead, Ms Patel told the Commons there is no quick fix. Pierre-Henri Dumont, the MP for Calais, said he “will not change anything” along the vast shoreline. And Labour MP Olivia Blake criticised Ms Patel for her plans to turn back boats. But late on Thursday, Ms Patel discussed plans to work closely with the French interior minister, proposing plans of collaboration and innovation towards tackling the crisis.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said officials are “not doing enough” to diminish the “power” of people traffickers aiding migrants to embark on sea crossings to the UK. He told the BBC ’s Political Thinking podcast: “To be honest, I’m sick of the Home Secretary playing to the headlines on this with grand statements about what she’s going to do, turning boats back and all the rest of it, but actually not achieving anything in relation to this issue.France said on it will bolster the surveillance of its northern shores, but does not think it will stop them from trying to cross the Channel to Britain. But more people made the perilous journey across the Channel, a day after a dinghy capsized off the coast of Calais and  people lost their lives. A group wearing le jackets and wrapped in blankets were seen huddled together on board an RNLI leboat before disembarking in Dover on Thursday morning.  In an urgent statement to MPs, Ms Patel said: “What happened yesterday was a dreadful shock, it was not a surprise but it is also a reminder of how vulnerable people are put at peril when in the hands of criminal gangs. “There is also no quick fix. This is about addressing long-term pull factors, smashing the criminal gangs that treat human beings as cargo and tackling supply chains.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was requesting “extra help” from the UK on Thursday as authorities revealed that pregnant women and children were among the at least  people who died when a dinghy capsized off the coast of Calais.

Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciessubcommittee advising on behavioural science, said itaposs much more important for the Government to provide clear information on how well ventilated spaces are, rather than placing the responsibility on themselves to follow particular rules. And he stressed the importance of ventilation in reducing the spread of Coronavirus. Earlier this week, the Government updated its Covid guidance on testing and prevention, warning people that they are more likely to catch Covid or pass it onthey are in crowded spaces or where there is limited fresh air. Officials noted the risk of catching Covid is much higheryou are spending time in crowded and enclosed spaces and even told people to take lateral flow tests before heading out to crowded spaces. Nicola Sturgeon went a step further and told Scots to take rapid Covid tests anytime they were socialising or shopping.  Professor Reicher said improving the ventilation of all public spaces is the most crucial thing we can do to stop the spread of the airborne virus. Even more important than hand washing, he explained to a  of experts hosted by the Royal Society of Medicine. Rather than castigate the public as irresponsible, it will be much more productive for the Government to create systems that allow people to express the safety of spaces.The Department for Health and Social Care have only rolled out an advert explaining the importance of keeping spaces well ventilated, almost two years since the pandemic begun. The explainer film launched in November , shows the impact of ventilation on reducing COVID- levels, and has clear advice for people to open windows for  minutes each hour when socialising indoors. Health officials admitted new research reveals how only a third of the public understand importance of ventilation, backing up Professor Reicheraposs call for clearer Government messaging.The sage adviseraposs comments echo the calls of Independent Sage scientists. The group said there is a need for a public health messaging scheme, including a rating and potential certication system, that can support behaviour around the use of indoor spaces. It follows a new study from Cambridge University which claims Covid became much more lethal across the UK in late . Experts used modelling to show that infections were becoming more deadly even before the highly transmissible Alpha iant of the virus took hold. They concluded that other factors, such as pressure on health services and the colder months, may have led to a higher number of people dying once they were infected than earlier in the year.

In his most upbeat intervention on the party’s internal politics in more than a decade, the last Labour premier to win a general election says that while preparing the ground to make the party electable is “dficult”, it is not “impossible”. Writing the foreword to the latest report from the Tony Blair Institute think tank, the ex-PM lays out four things Mr Starmer must do to boost the party’s image with voters. They include “continuing to push the far left back to the margins”, as members and MPs loyal to predecessor Jeremy Corbyn are sidelined.  Mr Blair says: “The country must know there is no question of negotiating the terms of power with them.” Urging his successor to embrace the technology revolution, he warns that Labour “needs a new future-oriented policy agenda based on an understanding of how the world is changing which rejects both the old fashioned statist view of the left and the status quo politics of the right”. He calls on Mr Starmer to avoid the damaging culture wars, as battles rage over issues like transgender rights. The ex-Premier urges Labour to “embrace liberal, tolerant but commonsensical positions on the ‘culture’ issues, and emphatically reject the ‘wokeism’ of a small though vocal minority”.  Mr Blair also calls for the leadership to “go out and seek the best and brightest from the younger generation to come and stand as Labour candidates. And make a virtue of doing so”. Opening the report, ‘From Red Walls to Red Bridges: Rebuilding Labour’s Voter Coalition’, the ballot box triple victor writes: “All of this is dficult. But none of it is impossible.” Pointing to the successes of New Labour, which claimed landslide victories in  and , and won a third time in , he says: “Labour could do it again. “Its leadership today is capable of governing and confidence is ing.  “The corner is turned. But the road ahead is long and the vehicle requires an engine which can accelerate at speed. “We just require the determination to do it.” The study includes the results of surveys by Deltapoll, which questioned more than , former Labour voters and more than , iniduals who remained loyal to Labour. It found the party’s traditional voting base had crumbled in the run-up to the  election disaster - its worst defeat for  years. “On the face of it, Labour’s problem seems almost impossible to solve,” writes pollster Peter Kellner.  “The old coalition, between manual workers and metropolitan liberals, appears to have disintegrated. “There does not seem to be a way to appeal to one without further alienating the other. “Yet our research suggests a more optimistic conclusion.” He warns that to secure a majority at the next general election, Labour needs to gain more than  seats.  “This will require a % lead in the popular vote – and a swing to Labour greater than in ,” he writes. But he adds: “The common ground in Britain today is broader than is often depicted. “Labour’s challenge is to reconnect this ground and these voters.” The findings will boost Mr Starmer’s attempts to rebrand the party and move on from four-and-a-half years of Mr Corbyn’s leadership.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour PartyJeremy CorbynTony BlairPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted people should be able to get together this Christmas - and said festive celebrations in schools should be allowed.It comes amid reports some schools have banned parents from attending nativity plays or festive celebrations in person due to concerns about the virus.The emergence of a worrying new iant in South Africa Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel has sparked alarm among experts, with flights suspended from six southern African countries.No cases have been detected in the UK so far but UK Health Security Agencyboss Dr Susan Hopkins said it was possible the strain was already here. Askedschools should be allowed to stage nativity plays, Mr Shapps told LBC: Let nativity plays play on is my view. We did not go through two, now three rounds of vaccination and everything  to have to live out last Christmas again when we werenapost able to get together as we should have done, in the numbers we should have done, with our friends and families.  So of course steps will be taken no doubt to make them as safe as possible, ventilation and the rest of it. Yes people should be able to get together. Schools Minister Robin Walker said end of term shows and nativity plays were an important tradition as he urged teachers to allow them to go ahead in person. He told PA: I want to see schools continuing to engage with parents in as constructive a way as they possibly can. Of course where they can go ahead safely, things like nativity plays and end-of-term shows are really important and a good way of doing that. I would want to see as many going forward as possible. Askedit was wrong for schools to axe in-person festive events, Mr Walker said: I think itaposs good where those important traditions can be maintained that they are. But he added: Of course I understand there will be schools that feel that they have to take extra precautions and particularly when itaposs about adults coming into a school and they need to be able to look at their local circumstances. They need to be able to work with the local directors of public health who will have a feel for the local situation. And I respect that thataposs going to be dferent in dferent parts of the country.  James Bowen, director of policy for NAHT, said: School nativities are a special occasion for pupils, parents and staff. There is nothing schools want more than to have a hall full of families enjoying the children putting on their festive show. However, schools have so many things to balance when deciding what to do this year. They are dealing with ying advice from their local authorities, central government advice, and a wide range of parent opinions - they really are caught between a rock and a hard place. Schools will be listening carefully to the advice being given by the public health teams and local authorities and putting the appropriate measures in place based on that advice. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said Christmas activities were an important part of school le but Covid related issues remain.Leaders will, however, be realistic about the signicant challenges they continue to face in tackling the disruption to normal school le brought by the coronavirus and will try to be flexible in managing the risks presented by bringing family members into the school environment to attend performances, he said.They will also be mindful of the challenges posed by having more staff absent than normal. Some may, reluctantly, decide to cancel shows but the technology that has played such a vital role in education during the pandemic also offers schools the opportunity to stage virtual performances. Whilst this is no replacement for watching young people performing in person, it does mean that the show can go on for many schools.

This dreadful tragedy should be a moment for the Government to reflect on whether its approach is working. But instead of asking how they can prevent more lives being lost, Boris Johnson and Priti Patel are pushing ahead with the flawed Nationality and Borders Bill. The Government’s own impact assessment states the proposed measures, far from acting as a deterrent, could push people into taking even-more-dangerous journeys to the UK. At the moment there are no safe routes for those seeking asylum here. Ministers have still not brought in the scheme they promised for people escaping persecution in Afghanistan. At the same time they have closed down the Syrian settlement programme and the Dubs scheme to help unaccompanied children. There is a need for France to do more and for tougher action against people smugglers.

Mims Davies called for tougher action to prevent the incidents after becoming a target of the vile, dangerous tactic. The Employment Minister, who has been in government since , said she was on a night out in Haywards Heath in her constituency.She told BBC Radio Sussex: “I was spiked a number of years ago, it was absolutely awful.“I woke up, black had just sort of come down, I sort of had to be carried home from the Haywards Heath Broadway.  “I promise you it wasn’t because of excessive drinking - I’m very mindful people know me down there, it’s not something you should be doing.” She added: “Not that long ago I was in a bar and I found something black in the bottom of my drink. “I pulled it out, I thought ‘oh, what’s that’, and didnapost really think anything of it, and threw it on the floor. “And it was only later on I thought, aposBlimey, what was that apos And I’d been in the darker part of the bar and come into the light and that’s when I’d seen it.”The MP since  spoke out after Sussex Police announced they would investigate  reports of people being spiked with needles in a matter of weeks.The force also said it was looking into scores of reports of drinks tampering. Ms Davies said: “I cannot imagine the worry you would haveyou’d had one of those spikes on you. “It’s absolutely right that people report that and I’m very pleased Sussex Police are taking this very seriously.” She went on: “Please keep an eye on your drinks, please stay togetheryou’re out with friends, please make sure you’re being sensible when you’re out and about. “Andyou’re one of these culprits, absolute shame on you. What are you thinking  What are you trying to achieve ” The MP wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this month to ask what more can be done to tackle spiking.She told the BBC : “We should be restricting who on earth can get hold of these products, as we would in any other sphere.What on earth is in those products  Whoaposs buying them and whoaposs sourcing them  Thereaposs more to this than meets the eye.

Parliamentaposs lobbying watchdog ruled a bid by Lord Hammond to arrange a meeting between OakNorth Bank and a senior Treasury official in July  was not acceptable and not consistent with the Business Appointment Rules. Advisory Committee on Business Appointmentschair Lord Pickles said it had been an unwise step for him to contact a senior Treasury official about a project developed by OakNorth. But Tory Cabinet Office Minister Lord True decided it wasnapost a deliberate attempt to break the rules, and so Lord Hammond would face no sanction. In that light, although we concur with your conclusion, we do not believe further sanctions should be taken given the particular circumstances of this case, Lord True said in a letter to the chair. We also note there has already been public criticism from your committee.  Lord Hammond had argued he emailed Charles Roxburgh, the second permanent secretary at the Treasury, in a bid to establish that senior officials in the department were aware the bank was offering free support to aid the Covid pandemic national response. Lord Hammond joined British banking startup OakNorth as an advisor in January , just six months after leaving his role as Chancellor. Documents show the bank wanted to meet with the government to discuss a financial toolkit which might help the government’s response to the Covid- pandemic.  But after OakNorth initially failed to get a response from Treasury, Lord Hammond contacted top official Charles Roxburgh to seek confirmation that OakNorthaposs message and offer of pro-bono support had been received and understood. Lord Hammond told Mr Roxburgh that OakNorth was “very keen to ensure that the right people” saw a presentation about “Covid stress-testing.” When he took the job at OakNorth, the committee told Lord Hammond he was banned from making contact with HMTit had been to benefit OakNorth or secure business on behalf of OakNorth.

The data appears to undermine top Tories’ insistence that asylum seekers should only use “safe and legal” routes to get to the UK, not dangerous small boats from France. After  people died trying to cross the Channel yesterday, Immigration Minister Kevin Foster highlighted the schemes as a way of helping people legitimately. He said: “What we want to do is focus our efforts on the most vulnerable in the regions concerned, rather than those who would prefer to claim asylum in the UK rather than the country they’ve reached.” Resettlement schemes were paused between March and December  due to the Covid pandemic, only for another UK lockdown to hit just after they resumed.  Home Office statistics published today now show that since December , , people have been assigned places with UK councils. Of those,  were relocated through the new UK Resettlement Scheme , which launched in March this year after being delayed by Covid.

Separately, Tory ministers promised an Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme, which in its first year would help around , Afghans who could not escape in time. But a minister this week said they were still working urgently to design the ACRS. Before Covid hit, the resettlement policies were helping around , people per year.

Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “The Home Secretary has spoken of her commitment to safe and legal routes but, once again, this shows her actions do not match her words.“Today’s statistics show the Government has - woefully – fallen short with only just over , having been resettled this year. At the same time, the Government closed down the Dubs Scheme having helped only  children when it was meant to help ,, and has still not set out how the Afghanistan Resettlement Scheme will work.“Having properly-managed safe and legal routes is essential to tackling the vile people-smuggling gangs – urgent action is needed.” It came as official figures revealed overall net migration to the UK has also dramatically dropped. It fell by % last year compared with , from , to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics.The ONS said the fall in immigration - , compared with , in  - was largely due to the Covid pandemic and Brexit.Emigration also fell, to , compared with ,.

This is agreed across all of the United Kingdom and we have acted fast, itaposs rather like the mink iant from Denmark last year, where we acted very quickly, within hours and weaposre then able, once weaposve checked it out, to release things somewhat,” said Mr Shapps.

Donna McLeod, the mother of Bobbi-Anne, sobbed as she paid tribute to her daughter and thanked friends, family and the wider community for their support. Surrounded by other family members, her voice trembled but she completed a prepared statement. She said: I would like to thank everyone for coming, on behalf of the family. Itaposs nice everyone is coming together in the circumstances. Unfortunately, our beautul Bobbi-Anne has been taken from us, but she will never be forgotten.  Iaposd like everyone to hold their candles up. This is for Bobbi-Anne. This was followed by a moment of silence as the entire crowd held up their candles in unison. The vigil and tributes were held next to bus stop where she vanished on Saturday. Earlier, Bobbi-Anneaposs family including her parents, grandparents and siblings, left their home and walked the short distance to the bus stop flanked by dozens more supporters, carrying balloons.  The family group then held up their candles in unison before releasing around  balloons into the sky. One onlooker said: It was a really touching, emotional moment as Bobbi-Anneaposs mother hugged her daughters and many of us started sobbing.

But then it just kept going on and on. Seeing all the police and forensic teams just makes it all more real. It is so scary to think someone can just be taken like that.  My daughter has always assumed Iaposm just being over protective, walking her to places and everything - but itaposs just what you do as a mum to not frighten them but just keep them safe. It makes you feel like you want to just hold them closer. Youaposd think there would be more cameras and security around here. Lauren Wallace, , added: Itaposs just so shocking that it happened so close. When you live so nearby on your doorstep, and you see everything going on, itaposs just a shock.  I definitely feel more nervous now to go out. You hear about women being followed around here, but until it happens just two bus stops down from us, she was literally just getting the bus - and it was on such a busy road too. Sheaposs probably done that trip thousands of times, it was just her normal routine.  The entire area has now been covered in lit candles and a pile of flowers full of photos and tributes to the much-loved teen. It comes as police today have said there is aposno known linkapos between the teenager and the suspect being questioned on suspicion of her murder. Bobbi-Anne left her home in the Leigham area of Plymouth at about pm on Saturday evening.  Police found a body near Bovisand, south of Plymouth, on Tuesday and although formal identication has not yet been carried out, Bobbi-Anneaposs family have been informed of the discovery and are being supported by investigators. At a press conference on Thursday afternoon, Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Leaper confirmed that investigations continued, but that there is no known link between the suspect and victim.

Marianne Fraser and fiance William brought the puppy, Thor, from a breeder on October  but they claim he started to act aggressively after a week. He began to regularly attack Marianne by locking onto her legs and biting and in the end the couple were forced to give up the dog, it is alleged. Images show Marianneaposs legs with severe bruising and, she says, bite marks from the German shepherd-Belgian Malinois cross who allegedly had serious behavioural issues.  Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror The couple said the dog had come from Fawnnest Kennels in Lockerbie, Scotland, and William told the MailOnline how they saw a dramatic change in its behaviour after a week. He started to challenge Marianne, locking on and not letting go, then the biting started. After couple of days, he got worse and it resulted in Marianne endlessly being attacked and her face being hurt, William said. Thor was picked up by Julie Nevett who runs a rescue centre which specialises in retraining pups for military or police purposes.She wrote on Facebook how she had received another dog from the same litter, which she named Thor , due to similar behavioural problems and was critical of the breeder.  I feel dreadful for both owners, not only have they lost a signicant amount of money and their puppy, they have quite serious injuries. I b****y hope the breeders are suitably ashamed of themselves. In an update, she insisted that the dogs are not pet pups but rather working line pups whose nature needs to be channelled appropriately and she rubbished the idea that either dog needs to be put down.  Replying to her first post, one person claimed that a friend had bought a German Shepherd from the same breeder which turned out to be riddled with problems. William has since said heaposs contacted the SPCA and his local council over the kennels who he claims have offered to refund the money in exchange for having the puppy back. He added: Itaposs not about the money - itaposs about the pup and what they have done.This is not Thor the pupaposs fault as they have obviously been kept as wild animals. I just want people to know there are two of the same pack there.

The boar-type animal, believed to be a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig, was one of a pair that charged at players at nearby Lightclfe golf club. The Mirror reported yesterday how two men were taken to hospital with minor injuries after the incident on Sunday. James was driving his we’s car with his dog and thought the pig was another dog when he first saw it – but then realised it was a “massive black pig”.  He stopped and called the police and RSPCA while trying to steer the biting animal away from traffic. He said: “Now and again, it tried to get at me.” A woman arrived at the scene who told him she kept pigs and helped him keep the hog out of harm’s way. After around two hours, a farmer arrived with a trailer and with the help of a police officer they managed to corral the pig inside using the car seat.  James, from Lightclfe, West Yorks, said he was not frightened by the animal. “I wasn’t really scared, but I was quite cautious. I was aware that it could bite. “But the girl was amazing – she even managed to stroke it at one point.” James said he was happy the incident finished without anyone  getting hurt.  He said: “It was hilarious. I only popped out to get the car.” But he said things may have ended dferentlythe boar had made its way to the nearby local school. He said: “It was very close to the school. If the pigs had been wandering around at school drop off or pick up, with little kids about, it could have been a bit nasty.” It is believed that both hogs have now been reunited with their owner.

Inspired by his father Mehmood Malik, , a retired cab driver who migrated from Pakistan as a teenager, he bought a board from a stationery shop and stuck QR codes to it so people could easily view his CV and LinkedIn profile. Haider, who has a first-class degree in Banking  Finance from Middlesex University, had been searching for a role since the beginning of the Covid- pandemic in , but became frustrated with Zoom interviews where he couldn’t properly showcase his personality. But when he arrived at the bustling station at .am, nerves began to kick in as he stood and watched crowds walk by. He said: “The first five minutes or  minutes I felt nervous because I was standing there empty handed.  “I found it really awkward. I didnapost know what I was doing, I found it really weird. “I had all my CVs in my bag. I was standing there empty handed trying to look at people and hoping to meet people rather than being proactive and speaking to them.” Instead, he decided to take a dferent approach and began smiling and initiating conversations with people on their way to work. Soon enough, passersby began to engage with him. He continued: “I held my CV in my hand and I was just saying good morning to people, just trying to engage people in a conversation. “A lot of people gave me their cards, they gave me their phone numbers, and started talking to me.” Amid words of encouragement from passersby, one person on their way to work offered le-changing help. Haider said: “There was one person called Emmanuel who actually posted a picture of me online. “He actually came up to me, he put his hand out and said ‘I wish you well’.“  He said he wanted to do something similar two years ago but he didnapost have the courage to do it. “He was happy that I put myself forward to do it and that he wanted to share a picture of me on LinkedIn.” Within an hour of arriving at the station, Haider had given out all his CVs. By .am, he received a message asking him to come to an interview for a role as a Treasury Analyst at the Canary Wharf Group. He said: “I got a text message from the director of the department at about .am saying aposcome in for an interview at .am’. “I had my car in the car park so I took the board and took all my stuff. I was like ‘wow, this is crazy’. “They interviewed me on the th floor of a building and Iaposm overlooking Canary Wharf thinking ‘wow, I never expected to be interviewed here let alone potentially about to get a job’.” After the interview, Haider went back to his car to head home to find that his story had gone viral on social media. He said: “That same day my le changed because when I got back in the car to go home after my interview, I checked my phone and I had about  missed calls from loads of dferent numbers. “I didnapost know that the LinkedIn post went viral straight away and my number was on my CV so people were scanning it and calling me.  “For the first three days my phone was non-stop ringing, it never stopped ringing and LinkedIn was really busy. “It was going crazy and I had to have my family help me to respond to DMs and get in contact with people.” Haider attended a second interview on Friday,  November at the Canary Wharf Group and that same evening he was offered a job. He said: “The first interview was the same day, which was a Tuesday morning, and then I got a second interview on Friday. And then by Friday evening they were happy with me and I accepted the role. He said one reason he had chosen to go straight to Canary Wharf was because of what he feels are unrealistic expectations for graduates to have work experience. He said: Recruiters ask for two years experience and youaposve just come out of university and youaposre not meant to have that. Thataposs one of the other reasons I went out [to Canary Wharf] as well.” With a lot of determination, a bit of luck and help from a stranger, Haideraposs plan worked and he decided to thank the man who had posted his story on social media by taking him to lunch. He said: “I wanted to get him some lunch to say thank you. “It was really cool the way it happened - I took a chance.

And one royal she appears to share an especially strong relationship with is the Queen. Although Prince Williamaposs romance with Kate blossomed during their university days - it wasnapost until years after that Kate finally officially met the Monarch.It was thought that at first the Queen had some concerns about Kate as a future we for her grandson. But these concerns have clearly faded away with the pair now enjoying a close bond. Here we look at how their relationship bloomed... First meeting  William and Kate first started dating while both attending St Andrews University in Scotland between  and . They both graduated in the same ceremony attended by the Queen, but despite being an item, it seems an official meeting between Kate and Her Majesty came much later.In fact, it was in  at the wedding of Williamaposs cousin Peter Phillips to his now ex-we Autumn.Recalling the meeting during an interview to mark their engagement, Kate said: Well I first met her at Peter and Autumnaposs wedding and again it was in amongst a lot of other guests and she was very friendly. Queenaposs concerns Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. But despite the friendly meeting, the Queen reportedly did have her reservations about Kate as a future we for William.Royal expert Katie Nicholl claims Her Majesty always liked Kate but was worried she didnapost have an identity of her own before she married into the Royal Family.In her book, The Making of a Royal Romance, Katie writes: Privately she had grave concerns and believed that Kate needed to have a job and an identity in her own right before an engagement was announced. And sheaposs not the only one, with royal correspondent Phil Dampier echoing the claims and saying the Queen was worried about Kateaposs work ethic. Phil told express: Kate was Williamaposs girlfriend for eight or nine years before they got engaged and got married. There was a phase where she appeared to be doing very little really.The Queen once remarked Kate doesnapost do very much so I think she had a fairly long entrance to the Royal family.Rare privilege  However, it seems the Queenaposs doubts were short-lived and before marrying William she was invited to spend some time at the Queenaposs Scottish retreat Balmoral.Keen for Kate to feel welcome, the Monarch then gave Kate a rare privilege. According to author and royal commentator Katie, the Queen allowed Kate to take photos while at Balmoral, knowing how much she loved photography. It may not sound like a big deal to the average person, but as Katie explains this simply wasnapost the done thing usually. In her book, Kate: The Future Queen, she wrote: Until now the Queen had met Kate only fleetingly at the wedding of Peter and Autumn Phillips, but she went out of her way to make her feel welcome, giving her permission to take pictures at Balmoral. And according to Katie, this and being invited to Balmoral showed how the Queen was ready to let Kate into the inner royal circle. She added: As a woman who has lived her entire le in the public eye, the Queen rarely lets her guard down, and very few apart from her family and closest friends get to see the real Elizabeth. Borrowing jewellery  Kate and William finally wed at Westminster Abbey in April , with the proud Queen watching on as her grandson tied the knot. And in a sign of her approval, Her Majesty allowed Kate to wear her beautul Cartier Halo tiara on her big day. But itaposs not just the tiara that Kate has borrowed from the Queenaposs personal collection over the years. Sheaposs also worn her Cambridge Loveraposs Knot tiara, her Lotus Flower tiara, a pair of sapphire earrings and one of her pearl chokers. Touching gts  But itaposs not just the Queen who has gted Kate several pieces of jewellery.Kate has also given Her Majesty sweet gts - including a touching homemade present for Christmas. The Duchess revealed how she had been in a pickle over what to get the Queen.  And in a documentary to mark the Monarchaposs th birthday, she revealed: “I was thinking, ‘Gosh, what should I give her ’ “I thought, ‘I’ll make her something.’ Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny’s recipe of chutney. I was worried about it, but I noticed next day it was on the table. “Such a simple gesture went such a long way for me.” Shared interests and future role So what is it that makes the two women get along so well  According to royal author Victoria Murphy, itaposs their very similar personalities.  She told Yahoo UK : I’ve always thought that Kate has more in common personality-wise with the Queen not an extrovert, but quietly self-assured with a love of the outdoors and the ability to compartmentalise.I think she still remains more of a team player than a leader though and perhaps more of a listener than a talker, but I think these qualities are well-suited to her current and future roles.

Three samples are from Hong Kong, three are from Botswana and the rest are from South Africa. Outlining the situation in South Africa, one senior scientist said: “If we look at the results they had up to a week ago, less than % of people were testing positive in lots of areas. That’s increased very dramatically in some parts to % in the last few days, and so that makes me concerned quite rapidly on people that may be arriving [in the UK] now.” Are there any cases in the UK  Currently, there are no cases in the UK. People who have recently arrived in the UK from South Africa in the last  days will be invited to take a test. Have any of these countries been put on the red list  Yes. Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe will be suspended from midday on Friday and all six countries will be added to the red list. How is it dferent from the other iants  Despite only being tracked for the past three days, the virus has been identied as having  dferent mutations already. By comparison, that is twice as many as the Delta iant, which has been the most prominent iant in the UK over the past few months. The mutations contain features seen in all of the other iants but also traits that have not been seen before.  Will the vaccines protect people against it  It’s too early to say. The mutations could potentially make the iant more transmissible and evade the protection given by prior infection or vaccination. One senior scientist has said: “One of our major worries is this virus spike protein is so dramatically dferent to the virus spike that was in the original Wuhan strain, and therefore in our vaccines, that it has a great cause of concern.” Has it been classed as a “iant of concern”  Not yet by UK scientists as they do not have enough evidence on its levels of transmissibility, however, some have said they are concerned. Professor Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, has said: “B... has signatures of cumulative mutation indicating that it emerged in a chronic infection. “B... does certainly look of signicant concern based on mutations present. Many have been shown to impact binding by neutralising antibodies, and some are known to increase the ability of virus to enter cells or to make them fuse together to allow cell-cell spread.”  Professor Ewan Birney, deputy director general of EMBL and director of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute , said: “Early evidence from genomic surveillance in South Africa suggests that B... is a serious cause for concern. The South African surveillance and epidemiology groups should be commended for their timely data collection, analysis and transparency.” It is known as a “iant under monitoring”, meaning scientists believe it may pose a future risk, but its impact is unclear. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:true,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shared on TikTok by a user named @mcoldkentroad, who claims to be an employee at the fast-food restaurant, the video shows worms in the drain of the soft drinks machine.The viral clip, which has since been removed from TikTok, initially suggested the creatures are maggots but a spokesperson for McDonaldaposs said they were earthworms. As first reported by MyLondon, McDonaldaposs said they immediately closed the drinks station and a deep clean was carried out after the issue was identied.A spokesperson told the publication: We take cleanliness and hygiene extremely seriously. Unfortunately, a number of weeks ago we were made aware of an issue in the drain serving the drinks station at our Old Kent Road restaurant.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.We immediately closed the drinks station and our hygiene team identied the cause of the issue which was fixed before a deep clean was carried out. The area was inspected by external specialists and no drinks were served to customers until we were sure that the issue was fully resolved.” McDonaldaposs added that specialists confirmed it was an aposisolated incident, not an infestationapos. Before being removed, the video was viewed over , times and numerous people took to the comments to share their disgust.  One user said they eat at the restaurant at least once a week to which @McOldKentRoad replied donapost.The original video poster also asked McDonaldaposs in the comments what do you have to say about this but didnapost get a reply.In a stitch of the video another TikTok user said they had been put off now, while someone  simply wrote: No thanks.This comes after maggots were allegedly seen dropping from the ceiling of a McDonaldaposs in Beckton last week.One diner filmed the wriggling larvae on a table and aposall over the floorapos at the restaurant on Thursday morning .

Bizarre footage of the incident shows the hungry customer parked up in the centre of the road in Manchester city centre last Friday, blocking a large truck and the cars behind from passing. Multiple people can be seen attempting to help or intervene, only for the stubborn man to repeatedly shout “I just want the fish and chips that Iaposve paid for”. Passerby David Williams had presumed the battery on the manaposs scooter was flat so went over to seehe could help but was told to “back off” by the scooter user. In the clip, the furious customer bellows at anyone who urges him to move, despite holding up traffic for several minutes while waiting for his fish and chips order to be brought out to him.  He then becomes embroiled in an explicit slanging match with furious drivers, branding them “f***ing low lives” and threatening them with “the law”. Even when his meal finally emerges, he refuses to budge, even telling a frustrated policeman who stops on his motorbike that “as soon as he gets the chance heaposll be out of the way”. The copper then proceeds to escort him down the road while warning heaposs “causing chaos”. David, a local Manchester man, said the scooter driver “wasn’t moving anywhere”. You can hear the horns going, the guy in the lorry behind was shouting but I couldnapost hear what he was saying,” he said. Everyone was getting irate, not knowing what was going on.  I was on route from an interview to where I live and I just happened to see this guy in the distance sitting in the middle of the road in a wheelchair. I thought he must have broken down or his motor had gone. I came to his aid initially but he shouted at me so I backed off. There was traffic behind him so I thought there must have been some reason why he was stuck there in the middle of the road. I got closer and realised he was waiting for his fish and chips of all things, at . in the morning. He paid for his fish and chips and was waiting for them to come out. I just couldnapost believe it. I was gobsmacked heaposd stopped in the middle of the road with a [lorry] behind him which could quite easily have pushed him aside. There were more than  other cars behind him. As Test and Trace general assistant David, , stood at the roadside in disbelief, he claims the bloke was there for more than five minutes while ious onlookers approached him to warn of the commotion. Itaposs quite a narrow street, itaposs one-way, sothereaposs a blockage at the front youaposre pretty stuck,” he said. After more than three minutes filming the heated arguments, David then spotted a unormed officer pull up at the side of the road while someone asked “have we got a protest going on here ”. Upon realising the wheelchair user is sat in the middle of the narrow side street, he warmly says: “right, letaposs go, youaposre causing chaos young man” before putting his thumb up at the lorry driver in thanks. David said: A policeman on a motorbike spoke to him and the man said aposIaposm waiting for my changeapos. The chap came out from the chippy with his change then off he went down the road followed by the local constabulary. He was making sure he kept going. You donapost see that very often. Greater Manchester Police said they were too busy to comment.

Sue Radford, , said the family has put up their first Christmas tree to decorate their home in Morecambe, Lancashire. Last year, the mum and her partner Noel put trees up in their living room, kitchen and on their front porch to feel the festive spirit.For previous Christmas celebrations, Sue said she spent £, on gts, splashing out between £ to £ each on the kids, the Daily Star reports.Sue also bought a personalised Santa sack for each child so that the presents do not risk being mixed up.  Sue hand wraps each gt she buys and it has previously been reported she can wrap around  presents every  minutes. She and Noel get through around  rolls of wrapping paper each year to cater for their massive brood.

Noel has previously shown how he cooks the kg turkey and kg of potatoes and Brussels sprouts.  The Radfords are financially supported by their pie shop business. When askedthe family were rich during a QA on their YouTube channel, Sue said: Absolutely not, weaposre definitely not secret millionaires. To me rich would be having the big mansion, the flash cars and quite a few hundred thousand in the bank, to me that would be rich but we are not that.  They get some money through brand partnerships on social media, but their main source of income comes from The Radford Pie company, located near their family home, which serves fresh, healthy pies to customers across the UK.

The monarch, , assured them she is feeling “far better” and is “looking forward” to the traditional festive get together at her Norfolk estate. Concern for the Queen’s health has been heightened in recent weeks after she pulled out of a number of major engagements. Her Majesty has been resting under doctors’ orders at Windsor Castle after getting injured nearly two weeks ago and last month spending a night in hospital for an unconfirmed condition.Christmas will have special signicance this year, after losing her husband of  years, Prince Philip, in April. Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here It is understood the Queen will travel to Sandringham on or around Friday, December . Royal sources said it was likely she would make a -minute helicopter journey from Windsor, but insisted a traditional journey by train from London to Kings Lynn had not yet been ruled out. Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.  Her youngest son Prince Edward, his we Sophie and their children, Louise and James have also confirmed their attendance. Princess Anne and her children Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall are expected to attend. And the invitation has been extended to Princesses Beatrice, her husband Edo Mapelli Mozzi and their newborn daughter Sienna, and to Princess Eugenie, her husband Jack Brooksbank and their baby son August. Royal sources suggested scandal-hit Prince Andrew had “obviously” been invited, while Prince Harry and his we Meghan were “highly unlikely” to fly over from Calornia with their two children despite being invited. The Queen spent last Christmas alone with the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle due to the coronavirus pandemic.A source said: “The Queen has told everyone she is feeling far better of late and is very much looking forward to welcoming them for Christmas.  “Like many other families, this will be the first time Her Majesty can gather with her extended family after being kept apart for so long due to the coronavirus pandemic.” Royal fans will be hoping toto the estate on Christmas Day to catch a glimpse of the royals as they walk en masse to and from the St Mary Magdalene, a th-century church on the Sandringham property. The Queen is said to be “determined” to attend church with the rest of the family, but will as in previous years be driven to the church to save her walking the short distance. After a period away from public duties the Queen has this week maintained a steady diary from Windsor Castle.

The Christmas tree is always the jewel in the crown of a homeaposs decorations and so deciding when to put it up is a big deal. Thankfully, following a study by electrics firm ERF, some answers have started to emerge about when exactly really is best.After the challenging months gone by, and with many families relishing the prospect of being able to spend Christmas together again after a year apart, the phrase that the holidays get earlier every year may never have been so welcome.

Marshall Metcalfe died after suffering catastrophic internal injuries after falling from a building on  May last year.Exactly a month later, his mum Jane Ireland was found dead at home after taking non-prescribed heroin substitute medication methadone, LancsLive reports. The pair both suffered from mental health issues. Marshall, who had been diagnosed with psychosis, had spent two spells as an in-patient at Tier  unit The Cove in Lancashire prior to his death.  An inquest held over the last two weeks that concluded on Thursday ruled that Marshallaposs death was suicide. Marshall had been seen at the top of the building where he fell to his death, the coroner said. He said: ”Marshall is believed to have left his home on May , , at  noon. Witnesses said his face was expressionless, blank and showed no emotion.”  The coroner revealed that prior to Marshall’s death, the owners of the building had been asked to put up permanent barriers to prevent anyone from taking their own le there. However, because of Covid-, only temporary barriers were put up which were then replaced with permanent fixtures – a month after Marshall’s death. Expert witnesses said that when Marshall had been discharged from The Cove in January , after his second admission, childrenaposs social care had closed his case and were no longer involved. Although Marshall was re-referred this didnapost take place until two months later.  Earlier in the inquest, the coroner heard from Brendan Lee, the head of social service for children and social care at Lancashire County Council, who said the council had identied a number of areas for lessons to be learned following Marshallaposs death. Staff at The Cove had a strong feeling that childrenaposs social care should remain involved in Marshallaposs case because of concerns about his mumaposs own mental health and capacity to parent Marshall, he said. One expert witness described the lack of links between health and social care represented a missed opportunity”. Staff from The Cove sent a Section  letter to the council notying them he had been discharged, but the letter was not passed on to social services. Marshall subsequently went without support from social services for several weeks. Despite some changes having been made at social services since Marshallaposs death, the coroner said he was concerned social services had not remained involved in his care after he was admitted to The Cove. Marshall’s mum Jane Ireland, , died on  June , a month after her sonaposs death. The coroner ed a narrative conclusion in relation to Marshallaposs mumaposs death after ruling out suicide, misadventure or drug-related death. The inquest heard that although she was struggling with Marshallaposs death, this was not uncommon and there was no criticism made regarding no action being taken after she disclosed her own suicidal thoughts. Miss Ireland and her family moved from Burnley to Lytham in  after her ex-partner bit part of her nose off. During the inquest, her daughter Holly said this had had a massive impact on her mum. I was there when it happened, Holly told the inquest. It had a massive impact on her. She just couldnapost get her head round why he did it to her. “I begged her to move away but she began to distance herself from her friends and started to communicate with angels. She relied on his family when he was in prison for what he did to her. She had no nose, she had to go through so many operations, and she found it so hard just walking through the streets looking like that.” After the inquest, Holly said while she had hoped the coroner would highlight the failure to put up a permanent barrier at the building before her brotheraposs death. However, she welcomed the coroneraposs Prevention of Future Deaths Report relating to closer working between health care and social care. At the conclusion of the inquest, the coroner said he intended to send a Prevention of Future Deaths Report to Gillian Keegan, the Minister of State for Care at the Department of Health and Social Care. The Department of Health and Social Care will have  days to respond to the report. The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

The forecaster warned that flying debris leading to injuries or danger to le is “likely”, with people also told to expect damage to trees and buildings, public transport cancellations, road and bridge closures, power cuts and large waves. Snow is possible for much of the country on Friday and Saturday and could continue to fall over the following days due to the cold snap which is set to run well into December.  Brits have been urged to take care when travelling due to dficult driving conditions. “The whole country is going to see blustery conditions, but the Met Office is telling us that eastern parts of Scotland in particular are going to see some dficult weather, said Graeme Day, the Scottish transport minister. Yellow wind warnings are also in place across most western parts of the UK on Friday, extending to the rest of the country on Saturday. Gusts are expected to reach mph to mph in parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, south-west England and north-east England, with the highest to be seen in coastal areas. There are likely to be blizzards in places where snow is accompanied by strong winds.  Stephen Dixon, a Met Office spokesman, said: “The worst-affected areas will predominantly be on the coasts, with gusts of over mph bringing possible disruption to travel and longer journey times, power cuts, flying debris and large waves, with beach material being thrown around. “There is also a yellow warning of wind in place along the west coast of the UK from am on Friday, stretching from Scotland, through Northern Ireland and Wales and as far as south-west England. “This reflects the impact Storm Arwen will have, with strong winds likely to occur into Saturday, when the warning is extended to most parts of the UK. “The south-east and London, though fairly windy, are likely to escape the worst of the gusts and remain relatively calm in comparison to the rest of the country, which will certainly feel the impact of the storm.” He said Storm Arwen is moving in from the North Sea and will begin to travel south before easing on Sunday.  The Met Office names storms on the back of their potential impact, with Storm Arwen declared as the result of the amber wind warning. Mr Dixon added: “As Arwen causes disruption there will also be the chance of snow in the coming days, especially in the higher regions of Scotland and northern England. “There may also be some snow in the lower ground region of northern England, though this is likely to be short-lived and fall in the form of sleet or wintry rain. “It comes on the back of a fall in temperature, with parts of rural Scotland and England to drop below freezing during the night.” The RAC has advised drivers to prepare for strong gusts by slowing down and being “very careful” when passing high-sided vehicles or cyclists.  Spokesman Simon Williams said: “In extreme windy conditions, bridges may also be closed and trees may fall so it’s important to allow extra time for journeys. “With forecasters predicting strong winds together with colder conditions, drivers should take this opportunity to prepare their vehicles for winter by checking oil and coolant levels, ensuring they have enough good quality screenwash that protects down to well below minus C, as well as having properly inflated tyres with good tread.” Scottish transport minister Graeme Dey said people should keep an eye on up to the minute travel advice. He said: “There is the potential for disruption on the roads, especially on bridges, and people should check the latest information before they set off, drive to the conditions and follow Police Scotland advice. The Traffic Scotland service gives details of ‘wind-based’ closures for the bridges on the trunk road network, allowing people to plan ahead accordingly. He added: “The conditions are also likely to lead to disruption on other modes of transport, so we are urging people to take the weather into accountthey are planning to travel on trains, ferries and flights.” UK forecast for the next five days Today: Rain clearing south, then colder with sunny spells and scattered heavy showers, wintry on hills. Becoming very windy across western and northern areas, with stormy conditions for parts of north and east Scotland with some heavy snow for high ground. Tonight: Very windy, with particularly stormy for eastern Scotland and north-east England for a time. Areas of rain, sleet and snow, mainly hills, moving south, turning showery in north and west. Saturday: Winds slowly easing, with further rain and hill snow in the east. Sunny spells further north and west, along with some wintry showers. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Many places cold but dry on Sunday and Monday with overnight frost, locally severe. Turning milder from the west by Tuesday with some rain and stronger winds.

TikToker @emmanuttyjane told how she and her friend came up with the plan after seeing a special offer at the popular roast dinner chain.Toby offered standard adult plates for only a fiver, but the big sell was that children ate for free when families paid them a visit. Between the women, they have ten kids - and lunchtimes can get really pricy when theyaposre out and about. With no limit on how many little ones could be fed, the pals took full advantage - and in true carvery spirit were able to stack their plates high.

Made with a cm-long pig in blanket, we had to knowit lived up to the hype and she headed to her local restaurant in Chadderton, Oldham. Emma said: For full disclosure, I didnapost pick up the Super Pig and eat it like a hot dog instead I used my kne and fork to carefully disseminate the extra large sausage sarnie and carefully dipped each piece into the pot of cranberry on the side. The sausage was tasty, the bacon extra crispy, which is a personal preference of mine. As a big fan of Toby Carvery and pigs in blankets, I had high expectations for the Super Pig and Iaposm relieved to say I enjoyed every last mouthful, evenit did leave me feeling somewhat of a super pig myself.

The artwork was veried by two telltale features, the artistaposs monogram was done with the same ink featured in the drawing, and it was done on paper bearing a watermark seen on more than  sheets used by the artist.  Albrecht Dürer is a German painter from the renaissance movement, who established his reputation and influence across Europe in his twenties due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in contact with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini, and Leonardo da Vinci, and from  was patronized by Emperor Maximilian I.

When sheaposd confront him, she said heaposd always say he was with the boys or playing FIFA, and I always believed him. So she got on a four-hour flight to surprise him. But when she got there and saw a long blond hair on the side, her mind was going all over the place. So I started doing some digging, she said.

Roberto Cazzaniga, , a former Italian national volleyball team player and current captain of Gioia Del Colle, was convinced that he was in a long-distance relationship with a woman called ‘Maya’. Their relationship began after he was introduced to ‘Maya’ over the phone by a mutual friend named Manuela, who was later found to be the mastermind of the catfishing scheme. ‘Maya’ passed off a photograph of the Brazilian Victoria’s Secret supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio as her own and tricked Mr Cazzaniga into believing that she was also a Brazilian supermodel. The couple never met face-to-face but he claimed they were engaged and had sent her lavish gts and financial aid for many years.  Some of the gts that he allegedly sent her included a brand new Alfa Romeo Mito and over €,for what he believed were medical expenses to treat a heart condition. Under pressure by his teammates to look deeper into the story, Mr Cazzaniga turned to the Italian authorities who informed him that he had been the victim of an elaborate scam.  Speaking on the Italian television programme ‘Le Iene’, he went public with his story and admitted that he had been catfished by a known fraudster and had racked up thousands of euros in debt. “I have so many debts, itaposs not easy aposwaking up from a coma’,” he tearfully said. During the course of their -year relationship, Mr Cazzaniga believed he was talking to ‘Maya’ – but in reality he was speaking to a Sardinian woman named in local media as ‘Valeria’, who he would periodically sent money to pay for her medical treatment.  Danilo, the victim’s brother, said: “One day he was up in the room, in the dark. I see him crying, I ask him what he has and he tells me that he has fallen in love but this woman is in intensive care for a heart operation and she cannot go to the hospital because she would be angry.” When faced with questions about her involvement in the catfishing scheme, ‘Valeria’ denied everything and then said: “Youaposre breaking my ***. “I am Valeria and I have been a friend of Maya for a long time, I met her in the period in which I met Manuela.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Alessandra AmbrosioVolleyballScamsRomanceFraud\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The two customers did not make staff aware of any valid medical reasons for shopping maskless at the cut-price supermarket in Cork, Ireland. In a clip of the row, filmed by one of the customers involved, the manager is accused of breaking the law, Cork Beo reports.The manager, who is sitting behind the till, says Iaposm not and removes the customeraposs items - a multi-pack of crisps and a bunch of flowers - from the conveyor belt.Heaposs then challenged on why he asked forprivate medical informationDo you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. All Iaposm saying to you is that your invitation to shop here has been removed, said the manager, adding that it was because of the wayspoke to him. He then reveals his name and states he is the Store Manager, while the duo repeatedly check with one another that the scenario is being filmed. Thanks very much, have a nice evening, the manager says coolly. The customer then states that this is discrimination to which heaposs once again told his invitation to shop has been removed. So weaposre being removed from the shop  Yes, thank you. Similar incidents have been recorded across Ireland over the past week as the festive season begins alongside a sharp increase in Covid cases. A video emerged of a maskless man hurling homophobic abuse at the staff of a cafe in Dublin earlier this week. After his tirade, he left, but only toa short while after to further verbally abuse staff before allegedly assaulting one worker outside the coffee house. Staff were terried he wouldwith a weapon. Lidl issued a statement in relation to the Cork incident, which read: There was an incident in our Charleville store where a customer was verbally abusive towards our store team. The Store Manager refused to serve the customer and asked them to leave the store. Lidl will not tolerate any abuse of our hard working frontline teams who have diligently served their local communities since the onset of the Covid- pandemic. Lidl requires face masks to be worn, as per government guidelines, when shopping in our stores. Lidl’s signage clearly requests that any customers who have medical conditions, which would render them exempt from the legal requirements, should proactively approach a member of management to inform them of this. On this occasion the customer did not make the team aware and subsequently became abusive.

Federico Döring, the PAN deputy for the Congress of Mexico City, was caught sitting on the loo and wiping his bottom, in the middle of a Congress session. The embarrassing yet hilarious incident took place in a virtual session on November  during a session of the United Commissions on Regulations, Studies and Parliamentary Practices and Administration and Procurement of Justice of the Capital Congress. In the clip, Mr Döring can be seen looking toward the camera whilst wearing a mask, before placing his phone on the floor, as his colleagues vote in the meeting. Apparently forgetting to turn off his camera, he then proceeds to gather some toilet paper, get up and clean himself with the paper in front of his colleagues.  The local deputy then hurriedly picks up his phone after realising his technical error and leaves the Zoom call. Although the incident lasted just a few seconds, the video has since gone viral. Also in Mexico, a politician last year released a statement explaining that she was not embarrassed by her body after being caught accidentally changing on a Zoom meeting.Mexican senator Martha Lucia Micher was on a the video call with members of the National Regeneration Movement political party, the Bank of Mexico and journalists last May. As they discussed the impact of the pandemic on the country, the -year-old politician began to remove her clothes.  Ms Micher did not realise that her webcam was still running, prompting screenshots of the mishap to circulate on social media. The senator apologised for the mishap but was clear that she had nothing to be ashamed of. She said: “I am Malu Micher, and I am not ashamed to have shown part of my intimacy by accident, because it is exactly the notion that a woman is ‘just her body’ that has allowed and fomented the objectication of women against which I have always fought. “I am a woman of  years of age who has breastfed four children, three of whom are today professional and responsible men, and I feel proud of my body for having nourished them. “I am a woman who has fought for the left for almost  years and who has occupied ious public roles in my fervent commitment for the defence of human rights, I am a woman who is not ashamed of her body, I love it and I take care of it.”  Many other colleagues and politicians also retweeted her letter and posted on social media to show their support for the senator.In April of this year, a Canadian MP was forced to apologise after walking in on a parliamentary video call completely naked.Screenshots of the Zoom meeting saw William Amos holding a mobile phone in front of his private parts while standing next to Canadian and Quebec flags.He later took to Twitter to apologise after the grabs of the private session on Wednesday were leaked onto social media.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON LoveViralHuman rightsPoliticsBreastfeeding\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Six res­­cuers sent down into the smoke-filled tunnels to find survivors died hours later. One miner said those at the centre of the huge explosion were “wiped off the earth”. Last night hopes of freeing the  men trapped ft down were fading with rescue teams held back because of explosive methane and poison­­ous carbon monoxide. President Vladimir Putin said: “The situation is not getting easier. There’s a dan­­­­­­­­­ger to rescuers’ lives. “We’ll hope they can save as many as they can.” Early reports said the men were in an air pocket beneath the fire at the Listvyazhnaya mine in Belovo, south western Siberia.  Before the rescue was halted, regional governor Sergei Tsivilev said there was still electricity and ventilation in the mine but that they had lost contact with people deep underground. He added: “For now there is no heavy smoke so we hope that there is no fire. The underground communications system is not working.” Some  people were inside the mine , miles east of Mos­­cow during the blast.  Nikolay Alimov, off work with an injury, said: “Many have been poisoned by carbon monoxide.” Some miners man­­aged to pull out others “before they suffocated”. Another pitman said: “I had just started my sht and there was a loud clap.  “There was dust...I started suffocating.” Last night locals were still praying for a miracle but the situation remained confused. There were also claims of a second explosion  hours after the first. In , over  died in a pit blast in the region. In  another  died.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

Letrsquos look at the dferent stages in the le of both types of trees.Real treesThe growing time for real trees is approximately - years to reach the most popular size of  ft . During that time, they provide habitat for wildle, capture carbon from the atmosphere, stabilise ground that is often unsuitable for other uses and reduce water run-off that can cause erosion.With estimated sales of in excess of seven million real trees sold in the UK every year, itrsquos clear that forestry also provides much-needed rural employment.You donrsquot need to worry about deforestation either: Christmas trees are a renewable resource, generally grown as a crop with up to  trees being planted for every two-metre tree that is cut down, ensuring that the environmental benefits of woodland are maintained and potentially even improved.As the seedling grows into a tree, itrsquos clear that real trees make positive benefits to our environment but once that tree leaves the forest or the nursery, your choices begin to matter.How can you help the environment  The first step is easy: buy a Scottish-grown tree from a local business and you minimise the carbon miles from the forest to your home.Most reputable garden centres in the area should be able to offer you a Scottish-grown tree, but other outlets may not. We recommend that you check the source before you buy!But itrsquos what happens to the tree after Christmas where you can make a real dference. Research shows that the way in which the tree is disposed of has considerably dferent environment effects.At one end of the spectrum, landfill is the worst possible solution for disposing of your Christmas tree, since decomposition and the release of methane negatively impact on the environment. Surprisingly, even burning the tree is preferable to landfill as that reduces potential emissions by over  per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, one of the most environmentally friendly solutions is to reuse the tree by chipping it for mulch or to compost it.Chipping simply accelerates the plant cycle that would occur naturally on the forest floor.This non-chemical process helps the tree break down more quickly than it otherwise would in the forest, naturally ing fibre and nutrients to the soil.Local authorities often offer a collect and chip service, and East Lothian Council have done so for a number of years now.Articial treesArticial trees, it is argued, are environmentally friendly because they can be re-used year after year and, for many, itrsquos the ideal solution for reasons of practicality and convenience. In fact, the key to determining whether an articial or a real tree is more environmentally friendly lies in the number of times you use the articial tree. Letrsquos consider the factors.Most articial trees are manufactured in China using plastic, PVC and metal, and these are then shipped to consumers around the world.The materials used in production and the global shipping distances involved in delivery combine to result in a considerable negative environmental impact from articial trees.And whilst the tree can be reused year after year, there still remains the problem of disposal at the end of its le articial trees are not recyclable and inevitably end up in landfill.According to the Carbon Trust, the carbon footprints for a m tree are:l Articial tree ndash kgl Real tree to landfill ndash kgl Real tree, chipped ndash .kg.Therefore, their advice is that you need to re-use your articial tree more than  times to equal the carbon footprint of a real tree that is responsibly disposed of. Many articial trees are not built to last that long and soyou decide that an articial tree is best for your lestyle, try to buy one that genuinely can be reused over at least  years.In conclusionCaring for our environment is a complex matter, andit only involved a single issue ndash such as the carbon footprint figures above ndash decisions would be easy. But itrsquos rarely that simple you only need to think about the many iables mentioned in this article to understand the complexity of the decisions we all have to make.We hope that this article offers you a brief overview that will help you decide which type of tree is best for you.As always, our plant team are happy to discuss the options with you and help you decide what tree ndash real or articial ndash is best for you.Theyrsquore also able to explain how you can get the very best from your tree and enjoy it throughout the Christmas season."},{"url":null,"title":"paralympian-leads-opening-brewerys-brand-new-visitor-experience","story":"Paralympic Games medallist Maria Lyle, who lives in Dunbar, was joined by members of Dunbar

Samples were uploaded to a coronavirus iant tracking website from South Africa, Hong Kong and then Botswana.A total of  samples have been uploaded to the website so far.Three samples are from Hong Kong, three are from Botswana and the rest are from South Africa.From midday Friday  November, the following destinations will be added to the travel Red List #BotswanaEswatiniLesothoNamibiaSouth AfricaZimbabweThe FCDO also advises against all but essential travel to these countries with immediate effect.New cases started emerging on Friday in Israel.Outlining the situation in South Africa, one senior scientist said: ldquoIf we look at the results they had up to a week ago, less than % of people were testing positive in lots of areas. Thatrsquos increased very dramatically in some parts to % in the last few days, and so that makes me concerned quite rapidly on people that may be arriving [in the UK] now.Currently, there are no cases in the UK, and more data is needed about the strain but there are early indications that it is more transmissible.Despite only being tracked for the past three days, the virus has been identied as having  dferent mutations already. By comparison, that is twice as many as the Delta iant, which has been the most prominent iant in the UK over the past few months.The mutations contain features seen in all of the other iants but also traits that have not been seen before.Itrsquos too early to say. The mutations could potentially make the iant more transmissible and evade the protection given by prior infection or vaccination.Professor Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, has said: ldquoB... has signatures of cumulative mutation indicating that it emerged in a chronic infection.ldquoB... does certainly look of signicant concern based on mutations present. Many have been shown to impact binding by neutralising antibodies, and some are known to increase the ability of virus to enter cells or to make them fuse together to allow cell-cell spread.COVID- UPDATE:@UKHSA is investigating a new iant. More data is needed but were taking precautions now.Have any of these countries been put on the red list Yes. Flights from South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Eswatini and Zimbabwe will be suspended from midday on Friday and all six countries will be added to the red list.The UK and Scottish Government and Northern Ireland Executive said on Thursday that UK and Irish residents who arrived in England between midday Friday and am Sunday, and who have been in the six countries within the last  days, must quarantine at home for  days and take NHS PCR tests on Day  and Day , eventhey already have a lateral flow test booked.Passengers ndash including UK and Irish residents ndash arriving from am Sunday will be required to book and pay for a government-approved hotel and quarantine for  days. They must also take tests on day  and day .It is currently not known how transmissible the new iant is From midday on Friday  November, non-UK and Irish who have visited the nations in the previous  days will be refused entry into England.Scientists in the UK are eager to acquire live virus cultures so it can be examined, but this takes time. It can take seven to  days at least to grow enough virus that can be shared with other scientists so they can study how it mutates and changes.Officials will now also have to wait for data to come from South Africa. The earliest they are expecting evidence to come through is two to three weeks, but it could be as long as four to six weeks.Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , said: ldquoThe B... iant has an unprecedented number of mutations in the spike protein gene, the protein which is the target of most vaccines.ldquoThere is therefore a concern that this iant may have a greater potential to escape prior immunity than previous iants.ldquoHowever, we do not yet have reliable estimates of the extent to which B... might be either more transmissible or more resistant to vaccines, so it is too early to be able to provide an evidence-based assessment of the risk it poses.It is known as a ldquoiant under monitoring, meaning scientists believe it may pose a future risk, but its impact is unclear.:Fears new B...

It is believed to be the result of curious travellers being attracted by the least used publicity.The single  of Beasdale just  miles west of Fort William failed to record any entries or exits in the year according to new estimated figures from the Office of Rail and Road - which said it was largely down to the impact of the Covid pandemic.But John Barnes, vice president of the Friends of the West Highland Lines said the figures were \"totally misleading\" as they only take into account tickets sold in stations and said it was wrong to say no passengers got on and off there.\"A lot of trains on the line see people get off and get on yet the ORR only cover tickets sold to and from the station.\"We suffer from that. It is deficient for tourist lines. \"It is the reason people closed stations under Beeching, because they only take into account tickets sold at stations.\"He also said the figures were obscured last year because of the pandemic restrictions and claimed ScotRail \"did little\" to encourage people back.\"The only marketing for the line is for the steam train and that doesnt even stop at Beasdale although the ScotRail service does,\" he said.\"ScotRail and Transport Scotland could be doing a lot more to promote journeys on the West Highland Lines and particularly intermediate stations. This is the real worry.\"The ORR admit that some ticket sales and ticketless travel are not included, which may mean that usage at some stations is \"underestimated\".Beasdale was originally a private station for the nearby category B listed Arisaig House, built in .It is a feature of the West Highland Lines -mile Jacobite steam train trip from Fort William to Mallaig which starts near the highest mountain in Britain, Ben Nevis, visits Britains most westerly mainland railway station, Arisaig, passes close by the deepest freshwater loch in Britain, Loch Morar and the shortest river in Britain, River Morar before finally arriving next to the deepest seawater loch in Europe, Loch Nevis.The West Highland Line, the steam train and the Glenfinnan viaduct had a starring role as the Hogwarts Express taking Harry from   frac all the way to Hogwarts.The station is popular with those planning to explore Glen Beasdale which takes walkers through oak wood and onto open heath, towards Bealach a Mhama and with stunning views of the surrounding hills of Aodam an t Sidhein Mhoir and Sidean Mor to the north, Drium Fiaclach and Glac Ruadh to the south and Beinn na Caorachand Beinn nan Cabar to the east.According to the Friends of the West Highland Lines, Beasdale marks a reprieve for locomotives, particularly for driver and fireman in the days of steam power, before a gruelling  in , mile and a half climb from the Loch nan Uamh viaduct.Beasdale station, which before the pandemic in   had  passengers, was one of six deserted stations during the pandemic.The others were Abererch, Gwynedd, Llanbedr and Gwynedd in Wales Sampford Courtenay in Devon, Stanlow and Thornton in Cheshire, and Sugar Loaf, Powys.Glasgow Central recorded the most passenger entries and exits in Scotland during a year that saw Britains passenger rail usage slump by % in a year.According to the ORR, this was the lowest level of journeys seen since at least before  and is a result of the pandemic.Some . million passenger journeys were made using ScotRail in - and Glasgow Central remained the busiest station with . million entries and exits, down from . million in .Edinburgh Waverley , Glasgow Queen Street , Paisley Gilmour Streetand Partickcompleted the top five most used.The ORR said as many as  railway stations in Scotland recorded fewer than , travellers in -.Feras Alshaker, director of planning and performance at the ORR said: ldquoThroughout - the railways remained an essential service for those people who needed to travel during a year which was impacted by the pandemic.ldquoGlasgow Central has consistently appeared as one of the top  most used stations outside of London and it is clear it remained a key destination for many passengers during the pandemic.ldquoThis year we have seen many railway stations with very few passenger entries and exits.\"However, we know that recent figures show leisure journeys are nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, while there has been a slower increase in commuter journeys.A ScotRail spokesperson said: ldquoThe pandemic has changed how people travel across all of Scotland, and although customers are gradually ing to the railway, wersquore still trying to recover.ldquoWe want to encourage as many people as possible to travel by train, and to make their journey a seamless and sustainable one.

The current bus service impacts are:  Junction Road will be closed between Castle Streetand Tankerness Lane . Public Bus services affected are X,,,,,S and . Buses will turn left out of Travel Centre, left at Kiln Corner Roundabout, left at the Ayre Roundabout onto Great Western Road, rejoining routes on Pickaquoy Road .Works are planned for Outertown Road, Stromness, starting on Monday, November  to Thursday, December .Meanwhile, folk can expect roadworks on the A junction with Gorseness Road , on Friday, December  and Saturday .Roadworkers will be heading to the B road on Shapinsay between Housebay Cottage and Howe Farm, from Tuesday, December  to Thursday .On Monday and Tuesday - December, roadworks are planned for Old Finstown Road between Zions Loan and Kingsdale.The A St Mary’s, corner at The Inn, will be subject to roadworks from Monday, December  to Friday . The work is programmed to last for up to five days and will be carried out under road closure conditions in order for the folks involved to be as safe as possible. To reduce the impact of this, the closures will be restricted to am to .pm which should enable school transport to operate with a minimum of disturbance.Outwith the road closure times traffic will be restricted to using one side of the road and will be controlled by temporary traffic lights which will result in delays during busier periods.A ersion route will be in place via the Aand the B from St Andrews Primary School to the First Churchill Barrier.Stagecoach has advised that during the hours of am – :pm, the X commercial service from St Margarets Hope to Kirkwall will ert via the Kirkwall to Deerness road past St Andrews Primary School to the First Barrier and on to St Margaret’s Hope as per the existing timetable. Due to the change of route and possible disruptions, OIC asks passengers to allow   minutes on current scheduled times as there are likely to be delays.During the period of closure, there will be an additional X service in operation from Kirkwallas per the current timetable which will serve as far as St Marys and back for passengers residing in the Holm area. Therefore, the pick up  drop off point for passengers will be from Park of Ayre and therefore there will be no service between the First Barrier and Park of Ayre during the period of closure.Posters notying passengers of the ersions will be placed on the X service, Kirkwall Travel Centre and affected bus shelters. It should be noted that passengers can track buses across Orkney on the Stagecoach App which would provide accurate timings.OIC apologises for the inconvenience this will cause during the period of road closure. For further information on the X timetable during this time please contact Stagecoach on   or visitwww.orkney.gov.uk transport for timetable information.As for the council#s flagstone repairs, the works on John Street have been completed, with all barriers and signs now removed and the section reopened, today, Friday, November .In Victoria Street, from Bank Lane towards its junction with Ferry Road at the fountain works have been completed and reinstatements are curing with barriers expected to be removed next week. Access by the works area will been maintained.At Ferry Road, adjacent to the fountain, works have started and will continue next week, when the appropriate signs and barriers are erected. Access will be maintained.From Monday, November , works will commence on the section of Victoria Street from The Pier Bistro to the bottom of Church Road, with the section being closed to all vehicles. This section will be closed until the end of November.The works will then move onto Alfred Street, from December , starting at Hellihole Road junction, with the section up to the Lighthouse Pier access closed. This will mean vehicle access to Lighthouse Pier  South End will be via Ness Road.Throughout December works will continue along Alfred Street towards Mayburn Court, further updates will follow, as the works progress.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

However, the board of Channel  should be open to all possibilities for achieving this, including privatisation.ldquoLikewise, it would be remiss of the Government not to consider possible reforms which might make Channel  more sustainable without a change of ownership.The report added that privatisationrsquos main benefit would be increased investment in programming, content partnerships and technology through access to capital, enabling Channel  to ersy its revenues, enhance its sustainability and be more ambitious internationally.However, privatisation is not the only way in which Channel  could access capital, the report added.The committee recommends that, regardless of ownership, Channel rsquos role in supporting small, medium, erse and regional production companies should be strengthened, while ensuring that the interests of large, established production companies do not take precedence over the channelrsquos sustainability.Lord Gilbert added: ldquoThe Governmentrsquos upcoming White Paper must justy its decision on Channel rsquos ownership in relation to a clear and compelling vision for the future of public service broadcasting.White papers are policy documents produced by the Government that set out their proposals for future legislation, and may include a draft version of a Bill that is being planned.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Picture Colm O#Reilly Belfast-- FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelfast city centre is expected to be busy for Black Friday salesClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailShoppers in Northern Ireland are expected to spend around £m on Black Friday deals alone, a leading economist has said.The ongoing pandemic means that most of that money will likely be spent online — a huge blow to the struggling high street retailers.Read MoreClaire McNeilly:OpinionBlack Friday: Streets or screens  The dilemma of big bargain ‘event’ and  deals to check outThe streets are, however, expected to be well populated with bargain hunters on what has become the biggest shopping day of the year.Dr Esmond Birnie told the Belfastthat shops here “will be hoping for a lot in both Black Friday and Christmas sales” after a “very trying” two years.The Ulster University senior economist also said there could be a gender imbalance when it comes to splashing the cash tomorrow.“The ious surveys out there are sending mixed messages as to whether Northern Ireland’s Black Friday spend per person will be up or down relative to  but there seems general agreement men will be spending more, on average, than women,” Dr Birnie said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Elsewhere, experts have said UK shoppers will part with almost £bn before December  to make up for last year#s cancelled Christmas, with a massive £.bn being spent on Black Friday goodies alone.Research by vouchercodes also forecast spending up to Christmas Eve will be £.bn higher than in  and £bn up on last Christmas, when Covid- lockdowns put paid to family gatherings.It can be daunting for consumers to navigate the murky world of what to buy and what to avoid in the sales, especially when watchdogs are constantly warning that Black Friday ‘offers’ are not always the best deals.So here, the Belfastanswers five questions on snaffling deals without getting ripped off:Q Will buying on Black Friday guarantee the best prices A No. An investigation by consumer group Which  found that nine in  Black Friday so-called deals from shops were cheaper or the same price before the same sales day last year. But remember that inflation and shipping costs are pushing up prices of some items by five to % compared to earlier in the year. So although a deal might seem pricier than you expect, it could still be cheaper than where.Q Is it better to wait until Cyber Monday before buying A If you find the product you want at a reasonable cost, after comparing prices where, do buy on Black Friday. Yet, prices on some products can fall even further on Cyber Monday, which falls on November  this year.Q Does Black Friday just last one day A No. Now the sales go on for a week, a month, or even longer.Q What about the Boxing Day sales A This is the other great time of year to get a good bargain.For Black Friday, retailers and manufacturers spend months negotiating knockdowns to offer shoppers. The same happens for what used to be called the January sales, but which now start on Boxing Day. But at this time of year, retailers are also running more clearances of items which didn’t sell well during the run-up to Christmas.Q Should I hit the high street or go online A Why not do both  Black Friday is becoming an internet phenomenon, with fewer shoppers in the shops compared to the panicked scenes of previous years. It can be easier to compare prices on your computer at home. But, in the spirit of supporting local retailers, remember that there will be tempting offers in the physical shops too.Meanwhile, ahead of the bumper sale bonanza, leading price comparison site money has analysed several of the most sought-after items and put together a handy guide on which products consumers should steer clear of.Fitness equipment: If you’re looking to spend big on a rowing machine, weight bench or treadmill, then you should wait until the new year. Brands know that one of the most common new year’s resolutions is to ‘get in shape’, so they ramp up the deals in January to take advantage of the booming market.Clothing: Most clothing retailers have jumped on the Black Friday bandwagon, so it will be possible to get good reductions this week. Butyou want to get the very best price, then you might be better off waiting. Brands run massive sales online and in-store throughout the year, especially in the weeks before and after Christmas.Cheap large screen TVs: Retailers drive footfall and get publicity on Black Friday by offering enormous K televisions for the lowest price they can get away with. It’s still possible to get a great deal on TVs on Black Friday, but onlyyou do your research.Off-brand models: Many retailers will offer very low prices on items from brands that you’ve never heard of on Black Friday. But while the discount might draw you in, you should remember that might be a reason you have never heard of the brand.Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with Brexit ProtocolIs council embarrassed  Row erupts over NI Centenary Antrim stadium naming ceremonyTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressArmagh brothers sentenced for £k tax fraudTop VideosPlayStephen McKinney sentenced for the murder of Lu Na McKinney - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeePlay#Noah will not be another legacy case#: Fiona Donohoe addresses crowd at carcade in BelfastLatest Northern Ireland Covid-related deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyLord Haw Haw walking stick going under the hammer in BelfastFresh waiting lists blow as neurologist jobs remain unfilledUpdates as Storm Arwen sweeps into NI: Ferry sailings cancelled as mph winds and snow to hitWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning LatestSouthampton’s ‘inertia’ allowed Bob Higgins to cause ‘incalculable’ damageSteven Gerrard full of respect for Patrick Vieira ahead of first dugout clashDenny Solomona ends Sale Sharks contract with immediate effectI could write a book… but who’d buy it : Mark Allen on ‘toughest year’ of his leDean Smith hopes showing his softer side will help get best out of Norwich squad,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

pounds, according to research commissioned by Boris Johnson.The Prime Minister has previously talked up the creation of a fixed link to boost connectivity, but it is understood the idea has been scrapped as it would be too expensive and technically challenging.A feasibility study led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy found that a bridge would cost an estimated £ billion, while a tunnel

not possibly outweigh the costs”.A bridge or tunnel would be the longest structure of their kind ever built.It would take nearly  years to complete planning, design, parliamentary and legal processes, and construction, according to the research.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The report also said Beaufort’s Dyke – an underwater trench on the most direct route between Scotland and Northern Ireland – would need to be “carefully surveyed” due to a million tons of unexploded munitions being dumped there between the First World War and the s.A bridge would have a “sacricial outer layer” enabling its main structure to survive a “local detonation”, the study said.Sir Peter concluded it is “technically feasible to construct, maintain and operate” a tunnel or bridge but recommended that no further work should be carried out due to the cost.Sir Peter Hendy’s review is an inspiring vision for the future of transport which we will now consider carefullyBoris JohnsonMr Johnson has pledged to create a strategic transport network across the UK following a wider review of connectivity by Sir Peter.One of the key recommendations of the report is to create a UKNet, which would map out strategic locations across the country and plot how to link them together, while providing extra funding for underperforming areas of the network.The Prime Minister pledged to set up UKNet “right away”.“If we want to truly level up the country then it’s vital that we improve connectivity between all corners of the UK, making it easier for more people to get to more places, more quickly,” he said.“Sir Peter Hendy’s review is an inspiring vision for the future of transport which we will now consider carefully.“Determined to get to work right away, we will set up a strategic UK-wide transport network that can better serve the whole country with stronger sea, rail and road links – not only bringing us closer together, but boosting jobs, prosperity and opportunity.”My recommendations provide comprehensive, achievable and clear plans forward to better connect the whole of the United Kingdom, leading to more growth, jobs, housing and social cohesionSir Peter HendyIn Scotland, Sir Peter recommended reducing journey times and increasing capacity on the West Coast Main Line as well as routes between Scotland and London, and conducting an assessment of the east coast road and rail corridor.Upgrades to the A in the south of Scotland were also recommended, which would improve connectivity to Northern Ireland, while calls were made for improving the A, M and M and the South Wales Corridor in Wales, along with the North Wales Coast Main Line and rail links to the Midlands from Cardf.“My recommendations provide comprehensive, achievable and clear plans forward to better connect the whole of the United Kingdom, leading to more growth, jobs, housing and social cohesion,” Sir Peter said.“I welcome the enthusiasm shown by the Prime Minister and the Government to my final report and I look forward to their formal response to my recommendations, which aim to spread opportunity and prosperity right across the United Kingdom.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “Transport is devolved to Holyrood and the UK Government should respect that.“We will always seek to engage constructively with the UK Government – for example, on cross-border rail and our shared desire for HS to serve Scotland – but UK ministers have no role in deciding investment in Scotland’s trunk roads.“Scottish ministers have not been sighted on the recommendations of the Union Connectivity report, howeverUK ministers really want to play a helpful role, then they could simply deliver the funding we need for such infrastructure investment in line with established budgetary mechanisms for Scotland to determine our spending priorities.”Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with

butshe does so, she will lose her immigration status and may not be allowed toto her job in Alberta.In an interview with the Belfast , the -year-old Eglinton native, who worked in intensive care at Altnagelvin Hospital, said she’s finding the situation “increasingly more stressful every day”.“It’s a classic ‘Catch ’ situation” said Justine, whose publicly-funded health insurance expired this week and cannot be renewed because of ongoing red tape over citizenship.“If I stay in Canada to have the baby it will cost me , Canadian dollarswhich I don’t have — butI leave I may never get back.”She added: “I feel so negatively about this situation thatI went home to Northern Ireland I’m not sure I’d ever want to come back at all.”Justine, who is  weeks pregnant, met her Canadian fiance

not have solved Justine’s immigration problem.“We’ve had three wedding dates and three provisional dates, and all six were scuppered by the pandemic,” she said.“We’re provisionally thinking about August next year but that isn’t confirmed .“To be honest, the wedding is taking a back seat  because of everything  that’s going on.”When Justine’s plight was first highlighted on CBC News in Canada, she was attacked on social media for supposedly “getting pregnant at a convenient time” and “doing it to gain citizenship”, which has done little to relieve her stress.Having landed a full-time job as a nurse in Alberta province, Justine applied for permanent residential status in May of this year, but the processing of that application has also been delayed by coronavirus.In the meantime, she has been informed that, unless she gets approved for residency, her provincial health insurance cannot be renewed.Not only will that make the birth of her child costly, but she’ll also have to pay for medical treatment should she contract the virus at work.“It’s a kick in the teeth,” the health professional said.“I pay my taxes, I’m working in their healthcare service.“I can’t change that. Immigration Canada are facing delays and Immigration Canada can’t change that either.Foyle College past pupil Justine, who also attended North West Regional College before going to London to study nursing, said she had no plans toto Northern Ireland until after the baby was born, but the health insurance situation could change that.“This is our first baby,” she said.“It’s a really sad, stressful and worrying situation but we may have no choice but to fly homenothing changes.”Justine, who specialises in geriatric and palliative care, is imploring Alberta Health to review the policy on how it decides what the health insurance extension period is.She applied for permanent resident status in May  and although her Immigration Canada file has been confirmed as ‘opened’, it has not moved past that point.The federal body has previously said it’s been experiencing processing delays due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Justine was given two extensions to her health care.The first was the one-time -day extension, followed by a second one after her local Canadian MP, Martin Shields, lobbied the western province on her behalf.“They made it incredibly clear that this was not normal that this is a gesture of goodwill and not to expect that again,” she said.Canadian immigration lawyer Peter Wong explained that it’s possible Alberta Health will backfill the costsJustine’s permanent resident status is approved — but that’s not guaranteed.A spokesperson for Alberta Health, meanwhile, said publicly-funded, insured health services are only available to eligible residents, as defined by the Canada Health Act.Justine, who admitted that she has found the whole thing deeply disturbing, said her last hope is that history repeats itself.“Under the federal Canadian Health Act I’m fully eligible for healthcare as I’m legally entitled to remain in Canada, and work the trouble is provinces can impose their own requirements on top of this Act and it’s these requirements which made me ineligible after  days,” she said.“Alberta Health faced almost the exact same story before with the pregnant American nurse who didn’t have healthcare.“I’ve talked to that nurse and I know they altered the extension time to  days.“All I’m asking is for them to do the same for me.”Most ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex

The Department of Finance said she received a severance payment of £, on July .Mr Reynolds received a payment of £, on the same date.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer DUP special adviser Lee ReynoldsIn October , it was confirmed Ms Little-Pengelly received a severance payment after ceasing to be a Spad when she became an Assembly member —this was a contractual obligation.She was co-opted as MLA for South Belfast, replacing Jimmy Spratt. She later became a Junior Minister in the Executive, holding this post from October  to May .Ms Little-Pengelly was re-elected as an MLA in May , but lost out at the March  election, triggered by the resignation of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, when the number of seats in each constituency was cut from six to five. She was allocated a £, resettlement allowance.She stood for MP in the June  Westminster election, taking the South Belfast seat from the SDLP’s Alasdair McDonnell, but lost it to Claire Hanna at the December  Westminster election.Parliamentary records show she received a £, ‘resettlement payment’. While the exact amount she received after her Spad role ceased in  was not disclosed, special advisers who had been in the job at least four years and left under these circumstances were entitled to six months’ salary. Ms Little-Pengelly’s salary at the time was just under £,.The Department of Finance confirmed there was no requirement for the settlement to be repaid after Ms Little-Pengelly ed as a Spad in . Earlier this month she confirmed she was resuming her career as a barrister.Ms Little-Pengelly said on Thursday: “My employment automatically came to an end when Arlene Foster left her role.“All Spad jobs are like this — the lack of security in these roles is why there is a redundancy aspect to the contract. If your Minister resigns or is sacked, then your employment ends. In this case, I received three months’ redundancy.”She added: “All public sector jobs have a redundancy arrangement, subject to how long you have been employed. This presumably recognises that it usually takes some time for people to find employment where etc, especially when their employment comes to a sudden end.”Ms Little-Pengelly added that redundancy payments “are not applied for and are paid automatically in line with the redundancy provisions set out in the contract”.She continued: “If a Spad resumes being a Spad within the period the redundancy applies, then the balance is repaid to ensure fairness — in my case in ,I resumed being a Spad within three months.“Redundancy or severance payments are always linked to the relevant employment and are payable in accordance with your contract in relation to that employment, not a previous one .”She said this was standard practice for public and private sector employment contracts.Mr Reynolds, the other recipient of a severance payment, was appointed a Spad to Mrs Foster last November. A former DUP group leader on Belfast City Council, he replaced Kim Ashton, who had previously quit after a few weeks in the role.Philip Weir, the other of Mrs Foster’s three Spads, stayed on as an adviser to First Minister Paul Givan, while Richard Bullick has ed, four years after quitting as a key aide.The other three Spads in The Executive Office are Dr Dara O’Hagan, Stephen McGlade and John Loughran.Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureRelated topicsArlene FosterDepartment of Finance The Executive OfficeEdwin PootsBelfast City CouncilPaul GivanMost ReadMichelle O’Neill criticised after taking ministerial car to Sinn Fein event in DublinAlex KaneOpinionSay it quietly, but maybe Bertie Ahern was right about loyalists’ issues with Brexit ProtocolTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Is council embarrassed  Row erupts over NI Centenary Antrim stadium naming ceremonyTop VideosPlayStephen McKinney sentenced for the murder of Lu Na McKinney - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeePlay#Noah will not be another legacy case#: Fiona Donohoe addresses crowd at carcade in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandBridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland ‘would cost £bn’ Covid-related deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyLord Haw Haw walking stick going under the hammer in BelfastFresh waiting lists blow as neurologist jobs remain unfilledUpdates as Storm Arwen sweeps into NI: Ferry sailings cancelled as mph winds and snow to hitLatestWhat magic does Antonio Conte need to conjure up at Tottenham Covid iant fears spook markets as FTSE plummetsBridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland ‘would cost £bn’Shoppers forecast to spend almost £bn on Black FridaySouthampton’s ‘inertia’ allowed Bob Higgins to cause ‘incalculable’ damage,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Hargey has said on several occasions she is committed to the reversal of social security service privatisation and ato in-house health assessments.SDLP communities spokesperson Mark H Durkan said he has been clear for years that in my view that Capita should not receive one penny more of taxpayer’s money for their administration of the Personal Independence Paymentsscheme.It is particularly galling to learn that they will now receive another £.m of public money over the next two years, he said.“We have repeatedly seen how the service offered by Capita not does provide value for money,” he said, adding that the y appeals process “leaves us with an even bigger bill to pay”.More signicantly this company leaves applicants traumatised due to the degrading and humiliating experiences they are subjected to and this should not have been allowed to continue,” he said.“This signicant amount of money could have been used to help deal with one of the many crises facing our people or gone towards reforming the PIP system or creating a way of evaluating those in receipt of welfare in a fair and humane way.Our Executive needs to cut its ties with Capita once and for all and stop rewarding these companies for their failure to adequately do their jobs. Minister Hargey also needs to provide clarity on her pledge to bring the assessment process in-house.DfC said: “To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, the Department for Communities has robust contract management arrangements in place.”Earlier this month, Capita apologised for any hurt caused to those going through the PIP process. Since , the firm has carried out around , assessments in Northern Ireland.Read MorePIP assessment firm Capita apologises for any hurt caused to applicantsCapita managing director Anthony King told MLAs on Stormont#s Communities Committee that the majority of PIP applicants have a high quality and empathetic experience, but he admitted this is not always the case.Often when things go wrong we can correct them very quickly, but in the small number of cases when things go wrong they can have very serious consequences for people and their families, he said.Obviously the more serious cases I am fully aware of and they can be deeply, deeply upsetting. I just want to take the opportunity today, in public, to say to anybody that has had a poor experience with Capita and been let down, that we are sorry. We do aspire to very high standards and we don#t always meet them we would like to apologise to those we have let down.Related topicsMark H.

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Seaacuten Mellon, one of the clubs founders and a man whose influence on hurling in the city has touched almost every club, passed away on Friday. The senior hurlers were at training when they heard the news, with centre back Breandaacuten Quigley tweeting his condolences afterwards. “It was with deep sadness I heard of the passing of Seaacuten Mellon, an absolute Titan of hurling andof hurling in the city,” he said, “Probably fitting that we were informed of his passing while on the field. It’s oft said, but we really will never see the likes of him again.” Mellons legacy is a hurling side whose stock continue to rise. Action from Lavey v Na Magha in Ballyarnett earlier this year. They competed well in this years Antrim league, reaching the Division  semi finals where they were defeated by a strong Cuacutechullains Armagh side. Championship action in Derry though, has proved both frustrating and disappointing. The frustration stems from the fact the club were denied a chance to compete in a county final following the withdrawal of opponents Eoghan Rua. The Coleraine side had come through a bruising senior football encounter with Slaughtneil the previous week, and the decision caused anger and frustration in Ballyarnett. Derrys hurling championship provided plenty of games for the city men, but results were disappointing given the elevated standard of those they faced. Attacking talisman Deacuteaglaacuten Foley. They lost all four group games by an average margin of  points, coming closest to Ballinascreen in their final outing, where they lost by nine. The defeats skew their statistics. They have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. At the other end, they have shipped - , an average concession per game of . points. In comparison, Cootehill have had four championship games, in which they have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. A concession of -leaves an average concession of . points per game. Na Magha will point in mitigation to the standard of teams they had to play in a group that contained senior runners-up Kevin Lynchs, and there is no doubt the dficulty of the Derry championship is greater. Personnel wise, the threat from the Cavan champions arises from full forward Diarmuid Carney, who registered - in the county final, with - coming from play. Cootehill celebrate lting the Cavan title. Half back Fiachra Hughes hit - for Celtic, while their two goals came from midfielder Oisiacuten Carolan and corner forward James McKay. For Na Magha, the experienced Breandaacuten Quigley will hope to drive his side on from the heart of defence, while they have a number of pacey forwards who will trouble Cootehill. Keelan Doherty tortured defences in Antrim all year, while Deacuteaglaacuten Foley, Timothy Rankin and Padraig Nelis all carry an attacking threat. A .pm throw-in away in Cavan adds another layer of dficulty, but the Derry side are no strangers to adversity, and in a week where they lost a club legend, will be determined to come home with the win. CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    Derry junior hurling final cancelled  The game had been due to take place on Sunday.    Defeat for Na Magha in league semi final  The Ballyarnett men were battling for a place in the Antrim Division  hurling league final.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

Seaacuten Mellon, one of the clubs founders and a man whose influence on hurling in the city has touched almost every club, passed away on Friday. The senior hurlers were at training when they heard the news, with centre back Breandaacuten Quigley tweeting his condolences afterwards. “It was with deep sadness I heard of the passing of Seaacuten Mellon, an absolute Titan of hurling andof hurling in the city,” he said, “Probably fitting that we were informed of his passing while on the field. It’s oft said, but we really will never see the likes of him again.” Mellons legacy is a hurling side whose stock continue to rise. Action from Lavey v Na Magha in Ballyarnett earlier this year. They competed well in this years Antrim league, reaching the Division  semi finals where they were defeated by a strong Cuacutechullains Armagh side. Championship action in Derry though, has proved both frustrating and disappointing. The frustration stems from the fact the club were denied a chance to compete in a county final following the withdrawal of opponents Eoghan Rua. The Coleraine side had come through a bruising senior football encounter with Slaughtneil the previous week, and the decision caused anger and frustration in Ballyarnett. Derrys hurling championship provided plenty of games for the city men, but results were disappointing given the elevated standard of those they faced. Attacking talisman Deacuteaglaacuten Foley. They lost all four group games by an average margin of  points, coming closest to Ballinascreen in their final outing, where they lost by nine. The defeats skew their statistics. They have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. At the other end, they have shipped - , an average concession per game of . points. In comparison, Cootehill have had four championship games, in which they have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. A concession of -leaves an average concession of . points per game. Na Magha will point in mitigation to the standard of teams they had to play in a group that contained senior runners-up Kevin Lynchs, and there is no doubt the dficulty of the Derry championship is greater. Personnel wise, the threat from the Cavan champions arises from full forward Diarmuid Carney, who registered - in the county final, with - coming from play. Cootehill celebrate lting the Cavan title. Half back Fiachra Hughes hit - for Celtic, while their two goals came from midfielder Oisiacuten Carolan and corner forward James McKay. For Na Magha, the experienced Breandaacuten Quigley will hope to drive his side on from the heart of defence, while they have a number of pacey forwards who will trouble Cootehill. Keelan Doherty tortured defences in Antrim all year, while Deacuteaglaacuten Foley, Timothy Rankin and Padraig Nelis all carry an attacking threat. A .pm throw-in away in Cavan adds another layer of dficulty, but the Derry side are no strangers to adversity, and in a week where they lost a club legend, will be determined to come home with the win. CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.    Derry junior hurling final cancelled  The game had been due to take place on Sunday.    Defeat for Na Magha in league semi final  The Ballyarnett men were battling for a place in the Antrim Division  hurling league final.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo.detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lara Scott is a Year  pupil at St Patricks College, Maghera.SportCounty Derry gymnast to compete at world championships overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry will have a new primary sponsor for the  season.

The ladies were quick to remind him they had tasted the adrenaline of the provincial stage, but for the men, currently waiting in the wings, this is uncharted territory. Although Sean Dolans made things sticky for them, St Martins eventually pulled away for a ten-point win which secured back-to-back junior titles. They leave a great deal of created history in their wake. The  crown, won in , was the clubs first junior title since , and they became the first team to win the championship twice within one calendar year last month. Desertmartin management team. ONeill says the players are keenly aware they are living through history. “Its a great place to be in really,” he said. “None of these boys have ever had this opportunity and there are boys round training saying theyve never trained in November before. “I know the weather hasnt been great, but you can see the boys want to be there and they want to grab this opportunity with both hands. “We also have to be mindful that we may never get this opportunity again, so its about making the most of it while we are here. “There are clubs who have had success over the past few years, that have been going in Ulster and they know what theyre at, whereas its new to our boys. “At the minute, were making the most of it.” The double junior champions will be without Ryan McGuckin, who suffered a broken jaw in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, while Marty Breen is again an injury doubt. Enda McGuckin Desertmartin are yet to concede a goal in championship football this season, and have conceded a paltry - across their five games. A total of -at the other end leaves them averaging . points per game and an average concession of just  points per game. In Derry, they have been almost impenetrable. Their opponents, St Patricks Donagh, are coming from a similar favourites position in Fermanagh. Like Desertmartin, they were tipped to win the championship and duly did so. Managed by Ballinascreen man and former Derry ladies manager Paul Hasson, they saw off neighbours Newtownbutler in the Fermanagh final. Across four championship games, they conceded - , leaving an average concession rate of  points per game, but their total at the other end may point to Desertmartins toughest test yet. Donagh celebrating their Fermanagh title. Donagh have racked up -in four games, only failing to find the net once in their opening-day defeat, also against Newtownbutler. They have averaged . points per game, something that may raise a few eyebrows in the Derry sides defence, and manager Kevin ONeill says it will be a massive test. “Ive seen a few videos of them, so Ive been able to watch a couple of their games. They won Division  in Fermanagh and are probably playing in a championship below where they should be,” he said. “They were favourites to win it and they went on and won it, which is testament to them putting their shoulder to the wheel and responded to a wee bit of pressure. “They have a lot of experience in their team theyre big and physical, so we definitely wont be taking them lightly.”  The club has been the centre of a real buzz since the county final. The club held their dinner dance, giving a chance for everyone to celebrate their achievements. A breakfast event has been organised for the morning of the game, before a bus will transport supporters to Enniskillen. ONeill says the players have to prepare a little dferently. “You probably dont realise it when youre just going to training, but there is a huge buzz around the place,” he said. “Theyre making the most of this opportunity and everybody in the club is aware that this doesnt come around too often and we want to make the most of it when it does. “Its the biggest game of these boys club careers, but so far theyve answered everybodys questions when the pressure has come on. “Its been a long wait, really four weeks is a long time, but well take an Ulster campaign no matter how long we have to wait.” CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    KEY PLAYERS DESERTMARTIN Lachlan Murray  Murray, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry, is a precocious talent. He has the ability to unlock a packed defence and has a willingness to work hard to find shooting opportunities Equally comfortable playing on the loop and taking men on to go directly through the middle, he is a player who will certainly be on the radar of the Fermanagh men. DONAGH Brian McDermott A - haul from full forward McDermott helped Donagh to victory in the Fermanagh final, and the full forward has time again proved the focal point for his sides attacking options. He hit consecutive hattricks in the games against Brookeborough and Coa, and flanked by the very able Eimhin Curran and Ryan Kelly, who both scored goals in the final, he is a formidable opponent.

We wish both loyal players well.Annahilt C moved to the top of the Intermediate Section with a hard fought - victory over Banbridge D.Mervyn Cairns in the top two singles games was too experienced for Maya Forsythe and Katherine McConnell, while Jack Shaw kept up his winning run with good wins over Anna and Trevor Russell.James Cairns also added two more wins to his CV.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

The summary for policy makers alone runs to  pages. To measure that change is actually happening, it uses a mixture of scientic measurements from the environment, like temperature, the composition of gases in our atmosphere, and the frequency of severe storms and heatwaves.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.John Barry is professor of Green Political Economy at Queen’s University in BelfastUsing a mixture of state of the art models dferent scenarios are explored to model the climate that has been observed historically. These sophisticated models take into account both human sources of warming and natural sources of warming. When the contribution of humans to warming is built into these models then they can better predict the way our climate has warmed. Human sources of warming include emissions of gases like Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Nitrous Oxide, called Green House Gases. These gases when released at a massive scale influence atmospheric composition and create a greenhouse effect that leads to global heating. In contrast, natural sources of known warming include solar radiationand volcanic activity. When the models include natural sources of warming alone, they cannot capture the change in temperatures that we see happening now. It is only when human and natural sources of warming are built into the models that they capture past warming trends. This is a summary of the scientic evidence for human induced global heating and climate change. Mark Emmerson is a professor in the Institute for Global Food Security at Queens University in Belfast However, the Glasgow Climate Pact, the title given to the document agreed at COP, demonstrates a worrying gap between what the science tells us and whatleaders and countries are willing to do in terms of climate action. Reading the Pact there is a stark contrast between the language used in the scientic sections and the rest of the document. In those scientic sections, we find language that is not usual in such diplomatically negotiated documents, including terms like ‘Science and urgency’, ‘Expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around . °C of warming to date’, ‘Notes with serious concern’. In disciplines with staid standards of scientic writing, this is the equivalent of scientists shouting at the top of their voices that humanity is not on the right path to recognising the dangers ahead, and that a serious course correction is desperately needed. This is why many were bitterly disappointed at the outcome of the conference – its failure to ‘phase out’ coal, oil and gas – the main causes of greenhouse gas emissions. Arguably, this was because the single biggest delegation to the conference was not a country, but rather the fossil fuel industry. Given that the science is clear, that we need to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible, the lobbying power of the coal, oil and gas sector was evident in the outcome. Let’s not also forget the role played by major carbon energy exporting countries such as Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia, and major coal users such as China and India.It has been argued that the s need to be a decade of action, of innovation in research, allowing for nature to recover to play a role in mitigating carbon emissions, whilst creating a sustainable economic recovery following the pandemic. COP make the efforts to decarbonise our economies much harder. Finally, we need to recognise climate deniers, refusing to accept that climate change is the result of human activity. As the countries and fossil fuel lobby mentioned above, they will have to account for themselves in the eyes of people facing the immediate impacts of climate change and future generations. Those in the global south, whose voices were so eloquently heard at COP, face suffering and deathin the years ahead. As academics and scientists, we have not used those terms lightly. Equally, we see ‘climate delayers’ who caution against urgent action now and support must less ambitious climate action. This is the equivalent of finding one’s house on fire but allowing it to burn brighter so you can better see what you aredoing. Climate delay is perhaps the new climate denial.Climate science has spoken, but so too have the people, those protesting outside the conference demanding ambitious climate action, and indeed history may record that it was those outside the negotiations not inside that had both science on their side and were on the right side of history.• John Barry is professor of Green Political Economy at Queen’s University in Belfast and Mark Emmerson is a professor in QUB’s Institute for Global Food Security——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA report by the House of Lords Communications and Digital Committee published on Friday says the Government did not ldquotake the right approach when they declared privatisation was their preferred option.Lord Gilbert, chairman of the committee, said: ldquoIt is dficult to reach a conclusive view on the ownership of Channel  without understanding the future public service broadcasting landscape.The report, entitled The Future Of Channel , said the debate about the future of the TV broadcaster has been ldquoa binary one between privatisation and the status quo.ldquoIt should instead start by establishing our ambitions for Channel  before considering how best they can be realised, the report said.The committee said both risks and opportunities must be ldquoweighed up, with much depending on how willing the Government is to protect Channel rsquos public service remit and its contribution to the creative industries as part of any potential sale.The committee was reportedly ldquosurprised that in both written and oral evidence, when asked to describe any potential benefits of privatisation along with potential risks, Channel  Corporationldquodescribed only risks.Lord Gilbert said: ldquoWe welcome the Governmentrsquos and Channel rsquos sincerity in seeking the strongest future for the brand. However, the board of Channel  should be open to all possibilities for achieving this, including privatisation.ldquoLikewise, it would be remiss of the Government not to consider possible reforms which might make Channel  more sustainable without a change of ownership.The report added that privatisationrsquos main benefit would be increased investment in programming, content partnerships and technology through access to capital, enabling Channel  to ersy its revenues, enhance its sustainability and be more ambitious internationally..removeHowever, privatisation is not the only way in which Channel  could access capital, the report added.The committee recommends that, regardless of ownership, Channel rsquos role in supporting small, medium, erse and regional production companies should be strengthened, while ensuring that the interests of large, established production companies do not take precedence over the channelrsquos sustainability.Lord Gilbert added: ldquoThe Governmentrsquos upcoming White Paper must justy its decision on Channel rsquos ownership in relation to a clear and compelling vision for the future of public service broadcasting.White papers are policy documents produced by the Government that set out their proposals for future legislation, and may include a draft version of a Bill that is being planned..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Peers criticise Government over Channel  privatisation proposals article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
