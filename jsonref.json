I was living his life for him. It was becoming beneficial for both of us. It was a coping mechanism advantageous to me, too.\u0027Marcus was so dedicated to his task that he managed to sustain this happy family myth for 13 years after Alex\u0027s accident in 1982 — but the fantasy he meticulously constructed was to utterly collapse after their mother\u0027s death in 1995.         Alex (left) and Marcus (right) have since released a book about their story which has been made into a Netflix documentaryWhile clearing their home of her possessions, Alex discovered an indecent photograph of them as children, with shattering ramifications for them both.Alex\u0027s search for the truth, and Marcus\u0027s painful reluctance to share it with him, is now the subject of a moving Netflix documentary, Tell Me Who I Am, which was also released in cinemas last month.\u0027Imagine a black, empty space. You\u0027ve lost everything in your life and you start from a blank canvas. Imagine how scary that would be,\u0027 Marcus says in the film.But, while Alex\u0027s quest for knowledge was driven by desperation to fill his mental void, both brothers admit they had a profound need to re-establish their twin bond.\u0027We have a thing,\u0027 says Alex, now 55. \u0027This is how we explain it. Most siblings operate on 100 per cent. Twins, identical twins, operate on 110 per cent. Some of that was missing and that\u0027s what I wanted back. I felt incomplete.\u0027Any secrets, then, would come between that bond.And there was much Marcus was concealing from Alex... The twins were born seemingly blessed, their arrival announced in The Times newspaper, published on February 3, 1964, telling of the birth on January 31 of twin sons to Jill and husband John Langford-Lewis. Three weeks later, however, a second posting was published in The Times. This announced the death of John Langford-Lewis, \u0027darling father of three-week-old twins, Alexander and Marcus\u0027.John was killed in a car crash. What the notice did not say was that baby Alexander was also in the car when it was hit by another vehicle in Wandsworth, South London, on the way home from hospital after his birth (fortuitously, Marcus had been kept in with a chest infection). When they were hit side-on, Alex, who was cradled on his mother\u0027s lap in the front seat, shot through the windscreen with his father. His mother, unlike his father, was wearing a seatbelt and escaped unscathed.Alex and his father were both put on life support. Alex made it — but his father succumbed.If the kindly John Langford-Lewis had been wearing a seatbelt, it\u0027s possible the twins\u0027 story might have turned out differently. But he wasn\u0027t. Instead, the boys were left in the care of their mother, a twist of fate with horrific consequences.Seven years after John\u0027s death, their mother married Jack Dudley, a cold, forbidding man. The twins had little to do with him, apart from entering his study each evening, shaking his hand and saying: \u0027Good night, Sir.\u0027However, as Alex recovered after his motorbike accident many years later, Marcus painted a rosier picture of family life. Their mother and stepfather, for example, never took the twins on holiday. But Marcus found a photo of them on a beach, holidaying with friends, and told Alex it was a family holiday.It\u0027s not difficult to understand why Marcus was so eager to forget their childhood and spare his brother. \u0027The abuse started when I was about eight, possibly earlier. I don\u0027t have many memories before I was eight because I was so traumatised,\u0027 says Marcus.\u0027Over many years, it happened sporadically.\u0027His mother hid behind her background, which gave her carte blanche to do what she wanted. \u0027Sexual abuse has no boundaries,\u0027 he says.The last time it happened, adds Marcus, was when he was about 14. His mother drove him to the house of a well-known artist in London whom Marcus had never met. They all had dinner and some wine. Then, as she always did, his mother left him and went home.The evening proceeded as it usually did when Marcus and Alex were left with strange men by their mother: the man took him to bed.But, on this occasion, Marcus told the man he did not want this, and left. He took the train back to Sussex and got Alex to open the window when he arrived home.\u0027Mum was very surprised to see me at breakfast the next morning,\u0027 says Marcus. \u0027But she didn\u0027t say a word. That was the last time it happened.\u0027What happened was simply not discussed, either between the twins or with other members of their family. \u0027If our stepfather had not been a tyrant, we\u0027d have gone to him and he\u0027d probably have done something about it,\u0027 says Marcus.\u0027He wasn\u0027t a very nice man, but I have no evidence to say he was involved.\u0027Following that final night in London says Marcus, he and his brother moved into an unheated shed outside the house, where they remained.\u0027It became a safe space for us. They called it a studio, but it was a shed. Better out of the house than in.\u0027On the night of Alex\u0027s accident in 1982, Marcus woke with a jolt, feeling anxious. Such was their intuitive bond, he told his mother he knew his twin was in hospital. Yet it was some hours later that she took the call from doctors.As for the scale of his catastrophic injuries, Alex says: \u0027From the brain surgeons I\u0027ve spoken to, they think the first car accident compounded the second accident.\u0027Alex could remember how to speak, but nothing else.\u0027You\u0027re taught how to walk, go to the bathroom. You don\u0027t know how to do your shoelaces up, you\u0027ve never watched a TV. All you have is speech. I don\u0027t think even Marcus realised how hard living in a blank world was,\u0027 he says today.Once home, Marcus played out a complex charade that their family life — sleeping in the unheated outhouse their cruel stepfather who called them \u0027the dim twins\u0027 their erratic mother — was all normal.Marcus never confronted his mother about the abuse, and she never acknowledged it — though, they presume, was aware that Alex remembered nothing of it.Unaware of his mother\u0027s real nature, Alex even grew to love her. For, vile though her actions had been, she could also be warm and maternal.Little wonder, then, that Alex was distraught to find his mother at the bottom of the stairs, unconscious, in March 1995, some 13 years after his car accident.She was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was to prove fatal, and she died aged 64 (her second husband had died five years earlier).Alex was surprised by his brother\u0027s reaction: \u0027He didn\u0027t even cry.\u0027 Marcus, meanwhile, admits he felt nothing after his mother\u0027s death. Rather, he was determined to keep the past buried.After the funeral, the twins started clearing out the family home. In the attic were boxes of old Christmas cards for the twins sent by friends and family, some with money inside, none of which their mother had given them. And they found a large stash of love letters from men with whom their mother had clearly had affairs.While Alex now says he began to experience a disconcerting sense that his mother was not the woman he thought she was, it wasn\u0027t until they cleared her bedside table that the horrific truth became apparent.In it, they found a picture of themselves aged around ten, naked, with their heads cropped off.\u0027For me, everything just disintegrated at that point,\u0027 says Alex. \u0027My mind was going all over the place. I asked Marcus what it was all about it, this photo, but he wasn\u0027t giving me anything.\u0027A few weeks later, I hit him with the question. Did Mummy abuse us?\u0027He said: Yes. I just went into meltdown.\u0027Alex begged Marcus to tell him the truth, but Marcus wanted to protect Alex — and, he now admits, himself.Eventually, however, he told Alex in broad terms what happened, both with her and her \u0027male associates\u0027.Yet so traumatic were the memories and so strong his desire to protect his twin that Marcus was still unable to share the full truth. Outwardly, the twins somehow went on as normal. They travelled and, thanks to a substantial inheritance, invested in property and opened a hotel in Zanzibar.Alex settled in North London Marcus bought a property in Hampshire. Both married and both had two children. Alex says his wife helped him through much of the aftermath of his horrific discovery.The brothers\u0027 relationship was good, but, says Marcus, \u0027operating at 100 per cent, not at twin level\u0027.While they wrote a bestselling book about their experiences, Tell Me Who I Am, which was published in 2013, it was only during filming for the documentary (it took five years before they agreed to tell their story on camera) that Marcus finally opened up about the abuse.Alex says that hearing his brother revealing the whole truth has miraculously shrunk the monster he had created in his head. His trauma has begun to come to a close, although he wishes his brother had told him earlier.Marcus, too, concedes that he should have revealed all sooner — but was motivated only by a wish to protect his beloved twin.As if all this wasn\u0027t enough to cope with, there had been further shock for the twins, when, researching their book, they learned their mother had put them up for adoption at a year old.\u0027We didn\u0027t know that,\u0027 says Marcus. \u0027Our ghostwriter, Joanna Hodgkin, who did the book with us, found letters from friends of hers urging her to come and get us from a foster home. She was shamed into getting her kids back.\u0027When asked if they loved their mother, the twins have, in the past, given remarkably similar answers. \u0027That\u0027s a hard question,\u0027 said Marcus in one interview. \u0027It would be too easy for me to say no. The answer is, I probably did.\u0027As for Alex, he says: \u0027That\u0027s a hard one. I was very angry with her over the years. If I could understand why she did it, I probably could. In that period I was a child, I didn\u0027t know anything different and she was my mother.\u0027After they finished the documentary, the whole truth in the open at last, the brothers went to the pub. \u0027We sat in the pub and bought a beer,\u0027 says Alex. \u0027Marcus said: Are we good? And I said: Yeah, we\u0027re good. \u0027Tell Me Who I Am is in cinemas and on Netflix now. "},{"url":null,"title":"Photo captures moment high school football player prays opponent","story":"Share this article \u0027I just had a moment with him praying over him, his mom, and his family,\u0027 Smith told the station. By Sunday night, the players\u0027 prayer had more than 140,000 shares.

Countries including Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Israel all claim to be the place where it was born. Most food historians agree the first hummus was eaten in Egypt, but nowadays it is diplomatic to describe it as being originally from the Levant: a region covering much of the Middle East as well as the Eastern Mediterranean as far north as Greece.Which is why I, seated in Costa’s in my party puffball skirt, believed hummus to be Greek. In Britain, we have embraced it in countless forms: Zorba turns out varieties including beetroot (ugh), peppers, lemon and coriander, caramelised onion, peri-peri, pesto and Parmesan, jalapeno, avocado, feta and, seemingly, the entire contents of the kitchen cupboard.Such fancy versions would not impress the inhabitants of countries such as India, Pakistan and Ethiopia, where 20 per cent of folk depend on the chickpea as their primary source of protein.         Smooth, beige and smeared inelegantly on a plate: if we ate only with our eyes, we’d never touch hummus, let alone pick up a dollop with pitta bread or a carrot stick. But, goodness, Britons seem to love itAnd, like many foodstuffs in poorer countries, the lack of genetic ersity in chickpea plants is a very serious problem.Scientists expect more droughts, heat stress and insect pests, creating the need for new varieties of food-producing plants with qualities that will let them adapt to changing conditions.But geneticists have discovered that chickpea plants do not adapt so easily.During human history, about 6,000 different plants have been cultivated for food, but now about half our energy-intake comes from just three: maize, rice and wheat — with chickpeas at No 13 in the Top Of The Crops chart.This week’s major recall concentrates the mind on the fact that hummus — as long as you have an electric blender to hand — is one of the easiest, most economical dishes to make.It also, like so much that is home-made, tastes freshly different when compared to a shop-bought tub, and can easily be tailored to suit your own taste.As they say, out of disaster comes opportunity.

She was 28 and pregnant. Salomon was supposed to be forgotten, erased from history, along with the millions of Jews murdered in the 1940s. But after the defeat of Nazi Germany, her father and stepmother – who in genocide’s lottery survived their daughter – found a cache of her paintings that included one of the most astonishing autobiographical documents of the 20th century. Before she was put on a train to her death, Salomon had set down everything about herself, her family and her world in a coruscating expressionist comic book that she named Life? or Theatre?To be caught up in Salomon’s modern masterpiece is to meet her, love her – and mourn her. Through this intimate visual narrative, we come to know Salomon. Today, we commemorate the victims of the Holocaust with monuments: ranks of concrete blocks or libraries of books closed for ever. But Life? or Theatre? is an open book that makes more sense today than when it was found because it is, in fact, that most contemporary of things: a graphic novel.Death shadows it from the start. In pre-first world war Berlin, a young woman called Charlotte drowns herself. We see her parents by the lake where she died, read the terse newspaper report. This was the aunt the artist was named after. In brilliantly compressed gouache paintings that combine rawness with clever perspectives and intercutting, Salomon shows how her parents met in a field hospital and married during the first world war. The scene depicting their honeymoon has three layers on top of each other, with the newlyweds’ feet coming down a red carpet watched by a bell boy, then entering a hotel bedroom – until finally we glimpse the couple in bed together in the dark.It’s like a storyboard for a Wes Anderson film. Cinema was clearly one of the sources for Salomon’s storytelling experiment. Born in Berlin in 1917, she grew up when the pioneering films of FW Murnau and Fritz Lang were streaming out of the city’s studios. They invented purely visual storytelling – the vampire’s shadow or a row of derelict houses are enough to tell the Dracula story in Murnau’s Nosferatu. As a child of expressionist Berlin, Salomon can communicate startling amounts of information and emotion in a single image. Her telling of Kristallnacht – the Night of the Broken Glass, in 1938, when Jewish people and property were attacked – takes just two images. In one, a crowd of tiny people read a giant poster that spits race hate. In the next, they are attacking Jewish shops.Yet the story Salomon tells is hers and hers alone. There was something tragic about the Salomon family, before their fate was defined by their Jewishness. After an apparently idyllic start to her marriage, and as parent to a young child, her mother sank into despair and threw herself out of a window. Salomon shows her mother’s suicide with precision. The image of herself as a young child dwarfed by her mother’s grave in a blue and black cemetery is overwhelming. Yet Salomon displays an irrepressible capacity for happiness: she makes her governesses’ lives hell with her mischief until she gets one she likes, a young woman who can play the lute and takes her to the seaside.Life? Or Theatre? is subtitled a “singspiel”, meaning a light opera, and songs are even specified for many scenes. In one, a singer on a stage belts out a lyric about love and death. You can listen to the same sad song on headphones nearby. As you do so, your eyes move towards a painting of uniformed Nazis parading in the street after Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in 1933.Young Charlotte’s world was getting brighter, though. The singer in this crackly recording is Paula Lindberg, a star in Weimar Berlin who would marry Salomon’s father, Albert, a celebrated doctor, after her mother’s death. She is portrayed as a gregarious, beautiful, joyous character who lifts the family out of their melancholy. Through Lindberg’s connections (who included Albert Einstein) Salomon meets a charismatic music teacher and artistic guru called Alfred Wolfsohn and becomes his lover.By now she’s an aspiring artist, but is she any good? Salomon seeks reassurance from her lover. A sequence where she waits to meet him in a Berlin park, before they touch hands across a cafe table as he tells her she is capable of creating something special, is so intimate you feel you are there beside them. The affair is portrayed with total candour. In a later scene, they meet and he asks whether they should talk in the street or go upstairs. Next thing they’re in bed, looking at a stain on the wall.It is one of their last meetings. After Kristallnacht, everything gets worse for Berlin’s Jews. Salomon’s father is sacked from his job, then lumpen thugs in raincoats take him away. We see him hunched over a spade in a labour camp. Only his wife’s charm persuades the Nazis to release him – for now. At a dinner party, everyone discusses escape.There’s a devasting twist to Salomon’s story, even before her life was cut short, that I won’t reveal. But there’s triumph, too. In a picture of herself in art class – she got in despite the severe restrictions on Jewish admittance – Salomon is drawing a nude male model alongside fellow students who include one wearing Nazi uniform.

It has already welcomed more than a million visitors since it opened in the summer of 2016. Enjoy a glass of wine in the eighth-floor panoramic bar, Le Belvédère, before embarking on Bordeaux’s Urban Wine Trail, which takes visitors on a self-guided tour of Bordeaux’s best bars, some of which have up to 1,000 different wines.Le Vertige serves cheese and charcuterie boards with its long list of wines. At Le Millésime, you can even order one of the premiers grands crus classés by the glass – a château cheval blanc 2004 (€60) goes down well with their posh mini burgers, or just order a glass of regular Bordeaux to enjoy until two in the morning. La Ligne Rouge specialises in little-known wines from foreign domaines including Serbia, Croatia and an English sparkly. It is on the left bank beside one of the oldest bars in Bordeaux, the Grand Bar Castan, a great place to watch the world go by – cars, trams, boats, cyclists and rollerbladers all pass in front of the bar, the interior of which is lined with art nouveau rocaille – an indoor cave with giant palm tree decoration.And don’t miss the Bordeaux Wine Council’s Bar à Vin, in the city’s flatiron building, la Maison Gobineau. Quality wines cost a fraction of what they do elsewhere, and it’s a unique place to drink a glass of Bordeaux supérieur (€2) or a pomerol (€8) beneath an Aubusson tapestry and stained glass windows.Alternatively, you might like to take a wine tour of one of the surrounding châteaux. Wine trails can be organised by boat, bicycle, on foot, hot-air balloon, donkey or horse-drawn carriage. Besides a vineyard tour by bicycle or electric scooter, the Château Marquis de Terme in the Médoc hosts a three-hour tasting of seven grands crus classés wines in the 19th-century workshop. The selection of choice vintages includes pauillac, saint-julien, saint-estèphe, margaux and haut-médoc with Barsac and sauternes dessert wines to complete a full house of the left bank of the Garonne’s most exceptional wines. The sommelier explains the history and essential characteristics of what makes each wine special. Equally refined, dine at the Château Lafaurie Peyraguey’s Restaurant Lalique, which was awarded the Sauternes region’s first and only Michelin star in 2019. At Château de La Dauphine, take a heritage tour in a bright red 2CV car with hilltop tastings accompanied by lamprey rillettes and truffle butter. Stay on in Saint-Émilion for a cooking class in the kitchens of the Château Ambe Tour Pourret. The lesson involves preparing a meal with seasonal, local products and then tasting it with the vineyard’s wine (€120-€160 per person). You won’t ever want to leave.Back in Bordeaux, serious wine lovers should consider a stay at the excellent Le Boutique hotel. The rooms are named after Bordeaux’s vineyards, there’s the in-house wine bar, large cellar and the sommelier Riccardo Mariconti gives tastings twice a day. “We choose five wines to taste, starting with something light and fruity, moving on to médoc, and discuss the acidity, tannins and talk about why guests like a certain appellation.”Broaden your drinking palateIt’s hard to believe, but there are other things to drink in Bordeaux besides wine. As well as having one of the city’s most romantic restaurant gardens, Frida shakes up fabulous cocktails from its glinting bar in the historic centre. For beer lovers, the Brasserie de la Lune’s Darwin pale ale is served on the sand-covered terrace of the Chantiers de la Garonne.For something stronger, pay a visit to Moon Harbour, Bordeaux’s whisky distillery, which was set up by two local friends in the redeveloping Bacalan docks and will produce its first single malt whisky next year. The highlight of the visit is the chai (storage area), which was originally constructed by the Germans during the second world war as a giant concrete fuel depot (the size of a zeppelin) for their submarine base next door. Although wartime events saw that no fuel ever made it into the vast concrete blockhouse, it’s a piece of Bordeaux’s urban history, an astonishing sight and worth a tipple of whisky to experience.To complete the drinking half of your bucket list, Bordeaux is only 90 minutes’ drive from Cognac. All the great Cognac houses including Hennessey, Camus, Rémy Martin, and Martell offer tours and tastings, but Cognac itself is a charming town whose devotion to the fermented ugni blanc grape has lasted unabated since the early 1700s.Taste regional specialities at local food marketsThe Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, including Bordeaux, is a must for foodies. The most picturesque market is at Royan, where 150 traders sell delights such as purple asparagus from Blaye, green asparagus from Les Landes, with oysters and cuttlefish from the Bay of Arcachon. At Brive-La-Gaillarde and Sarlat’s in the Dordogne, market stalls are overflowing with vegetables, dried duck, nougat and honey. Join the locals in the queue at the cheese counter or watch as the restaurateurs squeeze the fruit and search for the best truffles.You could also visit one of Bordeaux’s two new food halls. Opposite the Cité du Vin is the Halles de Bacalan, with 24 food merchants offering the region’s best cuisine du marché. Chef Frédéric Coiffé of L’Échoppe des Halles serves up to 200 dishes a day: delicious combinations of steak, duck, octopus or pork served on orange platters to share. For Coiffé, it’s “the future of food simple, local products served in a fun, convivial atmosphere.” At the other end of Bordeaux is La Boca food hall, which opened last year and houses 15 food bars with giant shared tables in the middle, a chance to eat Mexican, Thai, Italian, Basque, local seafood and then try a dune blanche from Chez Pascal, a bite-sized choux pastry, originally from Cap Ferret.Dine out in styleBordeaux is famed for its brasseries and bistros, many of which have been there since the mid-19th century. Try the traditional La Belle Epoque, or Le Quatrième Mur – recommended by EasyJet’s crew performance manager, Renaud Herin. Save up for a meal at Le Chapon Fin, a posh restaurant frequented by Sarah Bernhardt and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.For a more modern menu, head to one of Bordeaux’s most sought-after tables at Racines, where Glasgow-born chef Daniel Gallacher serves creative, delectable food inspired by his Scottish roots and training under Alain Ducasse.End the evening with a diamant noir, a sugar-coated, ganache dark chocolate by Cadiot-Badie, which has been making confectionary since 1826.Don’t leave Bordeaux without …Tasting the local speciality, a canelé, a tiny vanilla and rum-flavoured cake that looks like a miniature fluted jelly mould. The inside is spongy and the outside is a delicate caramelised crust. Locals eat them for breakfast, elevenses, lunch and dinnertime, and they can even be paired with Bordeaux wine.Start planning your adventure in Bordeaux.

Wine lovers and kids alike can embark on a sensory and interactive adventure to discover the cultures and civilisations of wine at the Cité du Vin, the swirling glass and metal wine museum stealing the Bordeaux skyline. The tour ends on the rooftop, where you can admire panoramic views of Bordeaux while sipping a glass of wine (or grape juice, if you prefer). Across from the Cité du Vin is new food market, Les Halles de Bacalan, whose vast brasserie serves a cuisine dubbed “démocrachic”: simple terroir recipes made from outstanding organic produce at affordable prices.Hang out with the localsThe cobbled backstreets of Bordeaux are a food lover’s paradise. Don’t miss Le Petit Commerce, where you can indulge in freshly caught grilled sea bream with a bottle of white Bordeaux. Prefer a wine bar crawl? Check out Vins Urbains for organic wines, and Le Bar à Vin, for everything from bubbly Crémant to Sauternes. Out of town, following the grape trail first planted by the Romans, is Château Lestrille, where winemaker Estelle Roumage runs her sustainable vineyard. She showcases her wine in chic locale, Un Château en Ville, her tasting room and restaurant in the centre of town.Hit the vineyards for a wine tourIn June 2020, the city gives itself over to the Bordeaux Wine Festival, providing a great opportunity to discover more than 80 of the region’s wines. Alternatively, head out on one of five wine routes, detailed on the official Bordeaux Wine Trip website. Drive one hour north through the Médoc peninsula, described as “the wine lover’s equivalent to Route 66”, stopping off at famous wine estate Château Mouton Rothschild, which can be visited by appointment. To the south, on the Graves and Sauternes wine route, is the Château Lafaurie-Peyraguey. Reserve a room, wander the vineyards with a guide or eat at the restaurant, Lalique.Escape to the beachIf you have a little longer, follow the locals to a nearby seaside bolthole. Surf in the white-topped waves of Lacanau, or build sandcastles on the supervised beaches at Hourtin. Visit the mammoth Dune du Pilat at Arcachon bay, Europe’s tallest sand dune the easterly wind changes its height and direction slightly every year.

Or plant your feet on the sandy patio at the Chantiers de la Garonne. It’s the perfect spot to admire Bordeaux’s Unesco-listed 18th-century riverside facades while sipping organic wines and local bitters from the onsite artisanal brewery.Bob over the lakes and seas of Lacanau on the Atlantic coastIf you’d rather be in the water than watching it, the Côte d’Argent (silver coast) is a one-hour drive from central Bordeaux and offers more than eight miles of sublime beaches and sandbanks shaped by the swell of the Atlantic ocean. Learn to barrel through high, hollow waves with a top-notch surf school, paddle a kayak out to sea and watch the pros compete or swish on water skis through the scent of pine forests across Lacanau’s freshwater lake.Check out La Rochelle’s maritime credentialsLa Rochelle, around two hours from Bordeaux, has lively tales to tell from visiting maritime adventurers throughout the centuries, and one of the best ways to explore is on two wheels. The city pioneered the first bike share scheme in the 1970s, when the mayor allowed people to borrow distinctive yellow bikes – for free – from the waterfront and bring them back when done. Visit the grand medieval towers at the port entrance, which served as a lighthouse and protected the citadel against invaders. Then head to the impressive family-run Aquarium La Rochelle to take an underwater tour and watch a jellyfish ballet.Explore the green maze of willows along Biscarrosse lakeA one-hour drive from Bordeaux sits France’s second largest freshwater lake, Biscarrosse, formed more than 4,000 years ago and connected in 1834 by canals to Sanguinet-Cazaux and Parentis.

Take a detour across the bridge to the small island of Île de Ré, the Parisian “Hamptons”, riding its dedicated 60 miles of cycle routes around the salt marshes, white houses and cobbled streets. Running 14 miles wide by three miles long (at the longest), it’s perfect for laid-back family cycling and delicious seaside picnics.Snake down the Garonne river, stopping at riverside marketsCycle riverside from the city centre down the Garonne river, part of the magnificent waterway running from the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean via Agen.

If Boris Johnson gets a parliamentary majority and is able to force his version of Brexit through, he will be the one who did what she couldn’t, who got the backing of the voters where she failed, who reopened a deal she said was closed, and who seized his moment when she didn’t dare. It will be his victory. On the other hand, if Johnson comes a cropper at the polls and Brexit ends up stymied again, May will go down in the annals of her party as the PM who squandered their best chance to save Brexit and to save themselves. He will be the fall guy. But she will get the ultimate blame.Anthony Seldon’s exhaustive inside account of May’s tenure in Downing Street offers little ammunition for anyone hoping to mount a defence of her premiership. Based on extensive interviews with all the key players (except the PM herself), his book portrays May as a brittle and shallow politician, incurious, inflexible and ultimately out of her depth. She has her moments – he commends her handling of the Salisbury poisonings, for example – but on the whole she comes across as fixed in her views when she needed to be open, yet indecisive when she needed to act: a fatal combination.Some of Seldon’s judgments are withering. He says May should have appreciated the enormous challenges that the referendum result posed for the whole of the UK and the deep difficulty of the choices she faced. “Any knowledge of history would have told her these were not ordinary decisions. But she knew no history.” Seldon calls it “one of the worst failures of imagination and opportunity” by any PM since 1945.She didn’t understand the present either. One of the mysteries of the first phase of the Brexit negotiations was how long it took the UK government to appreciate the intractable problem posed by the Irish border. On Seldon’s account, this was partly down to sheer ignorance on May’s part. “She showed no understanding, because she simply didn’t understand, that it was the EU’s customs union and the single market which made possible the dismantling of the hard border.” You would think someone might have told her. The problem was that she didn’t know how to listen to what she didn’t want to hear.Yet this book is not quite as devastating as it appears, because Seldon’s approach is flawed. By relying so heavily on personal testimony from the people involved, he is essentially trading in post-hoc rationalisations. May at 10 is not so different from Tim Shipman’s All Out War and Fall Out, which cover much of the same ground in even more breathless detail (Seldon occasionally relies on Shipman’s account to fill in gaps in his own). But while Shipman – a journalist – never pretends to be offering anything more than a gossipy tale of back-stabbing and score-settling, Seldon – a historian – wants to be doing something more. So he interposes his own magisterial verdicts on the events he describes. The problem is that it’s not clear where these verdicts come from.For instance, he says that May was right to call an election in 2017 and only has herself to blame for the crushing outcome. He lists six things that went wrong (from the botched manifesto to her timid and robotic behaviour on the campaign trail), and he places ultimate responsibility for each at her door. What’s missing, though, is any sense of the wider political context. Yes, May was a terrible campaigner. But how does Seldon know that the campaign was the root cause of her failure?The truth is that the Tories did not underperform in 2017 – May got roughly the vote share that was predicted by the polls when she called the election and more than any Conservative leader since John Major. What caused all her difficulties was that the opposition vote unexpectedly coalesced around Labour – it was the falling away of Lib Dem, Green and Ukip support that did for her. Could she have prevented that? Maybe she could have been more alive to the risks, but much of what happened – including Labour’s highly effective under-the-radar social media campaign – was out of her hands. Some of her stress during the election came from her sense of her own powerlessness. But Seldon wants to make it all about her.This highly personalised approach means most of the book’s verdicts relate to iniduals and their characters, for better and for worse. Some come out very well. Seldon seems particularly enamoured of Philip May, the PM’s husband, whom he describes as a consort of “consummate skill” and one of the key figures of her entire administration. But he provides very little evidence for what Philip May actually contributed, beyond being loyal and supportive throughout all his wife’s travails. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is some soft sexism at work here – what made it remarkable was that a husband was performing a role we normally associate with prime ministers’ wives.The person who emerges best is Jeremy Heywood, the head of the civil service, whose untimely death in late 2018 robbed the government of its wisest counsellor and safest pair of hands. This judgment is hard to argue with. He was not just consistently helpful, he was also solicitous, notwithstanding some bruising battles with May and her entourage. When the PR disaster of her tin-eared response to the Grenfell fire left her deeply exposed, Heywood texted a fellow official in No 10 to say: “We failed her. We deserve the blame for this, not her.” That others should have been so forgiving.Heywood stabilised May’s administration after the disastrous election result forced her to ditch long-standing special advisers Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill. With Heywood’s loss, things began to unravel again and her Brexit strategy lost its way. But May was far from being alone in the misjudgments she made. It’s clear that almost everyone on the UK side miscalculated the likelihood that the EU would buckle under pressure. Equally, the EU’s leading players fundamentally misunderstood how British politics works. Martin Selmayr, chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker and an EU powerbroker in his own right, was astonished to discover that Corbyn did not have May’s mobile number. “I would have expected that the leader of Her Majesty’s opposition and the Prime Minister might speak at least two or three times a week on the phone personally and have a standing communication line to solve this matter.” Really? The British thought the Europeans would behave like them and ditch their guiding principles when the going got tough. The Europeans thought the British would behave like them and stitch up a compromise when they needed one. May might have been tin-eared, but it was a dialogue of the deaf all round.Seldon is interested in the what-ifs of Brexit and he identifies some key moments when it could all have been different, if only one or two people had changed their tune. He says that just before the third and final meaningful vote on May’s deal, Steve Baker of the ERG finally decided to side with the government, potentially bringing enough Brexit diehards with him to get the deal over the line. He went to the office of the DUP’s Nigel Dodds to tell him of his decision, but because Dodds wasn’t there Baker had time to reconsider, and he ended up changing his mind again a few hours later. Seldon remarks: “On such flutters of a butterfly’s wings do great events hinge.” Yet what persuaded Baker to back down was bumping into a couple of his fellow Brexit hardliners who told him he was crazy to back May. So perhaps this butterfly didn’t have quite the influence Seldon thinks.In the end, there probably is no defence of May’s premiership: she was dogged, she was determined, but Seldon is right that she lacked the skills and the knowledge to navigate the Brexit minefield. However, by making it so much about the iniduals concerned – their feuds, their foibles, their resentments and regrets – he does her time in office a disservice. The wider story included many factors beyond any of their power to control. This highly personalised picture of the May years purports to account for the dysfunctional and factional state of current British politics. But it is also a symptom of what it seeks to explain.• Where Power Stops by David Runciman is published by Profile. May at 10 by Anthony Seldon, with David Newell, is published by Biteback (£20).

In Asia, the trading day is usually six hours, and in the US it is 6.5hrs.The lobby groups said shorter hours would improve market structure and have “a significant positive impact on inidual employees and … our industry’s ability to attract a more erse talent”. The London Stock Exchange is open between 8am and 4.30pm, while other equity markets across Europe follow the same opening and closing hours on local time. The IA estimates that the average trader works around 60 hours a week, as extra time is put in before and after the trading day to prepare and then finalise trades. “The addition of commuting time only exacerbates this problem. Anyone with family commitments is less likely to be willing or able to spend such long hours in the office,” the lobby groups said.AFME and the IA said the lengthy hours were also putting a strain on workers’ mental health. “The physical drag on inidual staff is also significant. Staff are habitually doing a 10-hour working session at their desk in an industry where lunch breaks are often still frowned upon. This is not conducive to good mental and physical health.”A compressed trading day would also make markets more efficient, as trading activity tends to be weak at the start of the session and jumps at the market close, the groups said. A London Stock Exchange Group spokesperson said: “We strongly support improving ersity and workplace culture across the City … We intend to consider the request in a formal consultation with London Stock Exchange’s global members and customers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42ad49bba184bac9a5160fb14abaf3802882ec54/0_6_1780_1068/master/1780.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58b7e61a36a66b56e11815c2740e7f9f","title":"divided cities inside the new documentary series from guardian cities","story":"Thirty years from the fall of the Berlin Wall, new global tensions are polarising our world – and our cities feel more ided than ever.

Wherever I travel to report I have always been struck by how different people can have such contrasting experiences of the same city – and it’s no different at home, in my neighbourhood of Camberwell, south London, where upscale coffee shops and gang violence occupy the same stretches of road.When we started  Cities in 2014, many of the stories we reported, on topics such as gentrification and car use, were ultimately about ision and inequality – and that was before the votes for Donald Trump and for Brexit upended the US and UK, the war in Syria sparked an unprecedented migration crisis, and climate change finally seized the imagination of those who realised that it was likely to be the poor who suffered most.Divided Cities is the result of that reckoning – a new global documentary series of five stories, from five cities around the world, that reflect these major faultlines in surprising and troubling ways.Over the last 12 months our team –  executive producer Jess Gormley, producer Anetta Jones, film-maker Max Duncan and myself – worked with our contacts around the world to identify what we believe to be some of the more vital and startling ways cities are ided today. All we knew at first was that we wanted to move beyond Trump and Brexit – both of which have sucked up so much oxygen that many equally important stories are going unreported – and to rethink ision from a fresh perspective.That meant avoiding some quite well-covered cities: the “peace walls” of Belfast, for example, or the famously ided city of Jerusalem, a place as thick with history as it is with journalists. It also meant moving on from certain well-trodden urban inequalities such as gentrification or the conflict between cyclists and drivers, which, though emotive flashpoints, are issues we have covered (and will continue to cover) in dozens of different ways.Instead, the stories that jumped out to us came from five continents and embodied five entirely different conceptions of what it means to be a “ided city”. We started in Nicosia with a classic of the genre, as it were: the UN-patrolled barricade that cleaves the island of Cyprus into a mostly Greek Cypriot south and Turkish Cypriot north. The story that seized us most strongly there, however, was new: a young generation who didn’t experience the war, and who reject the military conscription that requires them to point guns at their friends across what is now an shabby, overgrown buffer zone.In Africa, meanwhile, we were fortunate enough to be present on the ground for one the most dramatic, dangerous and daring events in the world’s ongoing migration crisis: a night-time climb of the border fence at Melilla. Along with Ceuta, Melilla is a truly unusual city – a Spanish outpost in north Africa, separated from Morocco by a fence. Hundreds of people, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, end their treacherous journeys across the desert by hiding out in forest camps near the fence, waiting for the right moment – sometimes as long as six months – to try to climb en masse in the dead of night. In May this year, one attempt saw almost 60 migrants make it over. They stepped on to EU soil, claiming asylum. But the far-right political party Vox wants them out, and is proposing two ideas that will sound troublingly familiar: to “make Spain great again” by building, you guessed it, a wall. It’s a closed-door attitude that makes no provision for another quirk of this fascinating city: 30,000 people cross through the fence daily for work, but who must return to Morocco each night. Many work as “porters”, exploiting a legal grey area that allows them to carry goods tax-free. The trade is tolerated by the authorities, and the economic benefits it brings are relied on by both Melillans and Moroccans.Other cities lack physical barriers entirely, but are no less split. The socialist capital of Havana boasts a truly bizarre system of two currencies: one for the socialist state sector, which pays the salaries of doctors and other civil servants and one for the newly booming private sector, which is pegged to the US dollar and is worth 24 times the state currency. This oddity leads to some obscene ironies, such as doctors earning so little that they can’t afford to feed their own families, leading some to abandon their training and communities and take up unrelated private sector roles, such as driving taxis for tourists.The very wealth of the United States to the north, meanwhile, generates equally perverse schisms. One of the worst of the country’s so-called “food deserts” is in Memphis, Tennessee, where many neighbourhoods lack what seems a basic right in richer neighbourhoods – a supermarket. For poorer residents, most of whom don’t own cars, that either means long journeys on multiple buses, or feeding your kids junk from fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, where much of what is sold as food doesn’t truly qualify for the name.Finally, if there is one unfolding phenomenon that unites us all in ision, so to speak, it is the environmental crisis, rapidly shaping up to be the greatest inequality issue we are likely to face as a species. As India’s capital, Delhi, grows dark under a cloud of smog that refuses to dissipate, following a summer where more than a hundred Delhi residents died as a direct result of overheating, we found a city riven by “climate apartheid”. Some can afford to protect themselves from the elements (via cars, air purifiers, and air conditioned spaces). Others must live, work, suffer and sometimes die in the heat and pollution.None of these isions is carved in stone. In each city, we found irrepressible people who don’t just passively accept their fate. The young Nicosians willing to face prison rather than take up arms against other teenagers on the opposite side of the ide. The migrants to Melilla who lift each other to better lives, and the Spanish citizens who help them to keep Spain a welcoming country. The Cuban doctors who celebrate the successes of socialism yet bravely speak out against the warping effects of the two currencies. The Memphians who try, and fail, and try again to get fresh, nutritious food to their neighbourhoods so that McDonald’s and CVS aren’t the only places to get a meal.After five years of  Cities, we wanted to ask a question that has hummed behind most of the work we’ve done: is ision inevitable?

As Maya Angelou put it: “When people show you who they are, believe them the first time.” Here was a confession, an insight into a worldview steeped in a sense of class privilege and social superiority. We don’t need to read between the lines: the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has done it for us. When the BBC’s Evan Davis put it to him that Rees-Mogg was effectively saying: “I wouldn’t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade’s advice,” Bridgen did not demur, adding – after a sigh-filled pause – “But we want very clever people running the country, don’t we, Evan? … That’s a byproduct of what Jacob is, that’s why he is in a position of authority.”Leave aside that the Grenfell disaster itself was an indictment of a rotten social order that values money over people’s lives. Here, in the minds of Rees-Mogg and Bridgen, is a world in which the masses are feeble, ignorant, simple-minded, requiring leadership by their supposed social betters who are, quite literally, born to rule. If Rees-Mogg is indeed “very clever”, it needs more proof than pretentious smatterings of Latin phrases recalled from Eton, and there it is lacking. Accusations of “class warfare” have always been a staple Tory attack line, normally when confronted with calls to more equitably tax wealth and income. But to paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, one side preaches the class war while the other vigorously fights it. While other Tories may choose their words more carefully, the attitude underpinning Rees-Mogg’s and Bridgen’s words are a feature, not a bug, of their party. Without a sense of social superiority, there would be no Toryism.Indeed, Tories have often been as candid as Rees-Mogg is himself. Labour’s birth as a mass political force had much to do with an infamous court ruling. The Taff Vale legal judgment of 1901 made trade unions liable for profits lost in strikes, effectively rendering industrial action impossible and underlining the need for unions to have parliamentary representation. The future Tory prime minister Stanley Baldwin later admitted: “The Conservatives can’t talk of class war. They started it.” When Britain’s last general strike, in 1926, ended in defeat for the trade union movement, the former Tory prime minister Arthur Balfour sneered: “The general strike has taught the working class more in four days than years of talking could have done.”Back in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher’s right-hand man Keith Joseph – a pioneer of market fundamentalism who was later dubbed “the Mad Monk” – ruined his Tory leadership chances by making the mistake of saying what he truly thought. He argued that more and more children “are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world and bring them up. They are born to mothers who were first pregnant in adolescence in social classes 4 and 5 … Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment.” His final line – “The balance of our population, our human stock is threatened” – outed his eugenicist bigotry in its all its ugliness: that the ill-educated poor would out-breed their social superiors.As the daughter of a shopkeeper, Margaret Thatcher herself is frequently portrayed as a challenge to the old Tory toffs, but her snobbery was no less great. As one shadow cabinet minister told the ’s Hugo Young on the eve of her 1979 electoral triumph: “She is still basically a Finchley lady. Her view of the world is distressingly narrow. She regards the working class as idle, deceitful, inferior and bloody-minded.” Even supposed liberal Tories such as Michael Heseltine believed in the rule of those with privilege over those who did not, even if they believed that rule should be benevolent. He believed in “good enlightened capitalism – paternalism if you like,” as he once put it. “Noblesse oblige. I believe strongly that those with power and privilege have responsibilities.”Fear of, and contempt towards, working-class people is an unbroken thread in Tory history. Take the revelation by Nick Clegg that the Tory leadership once told him: “I don’t understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing – it just creates Labour voters.” Indeed, it reflected a traditional Tory aim: that a sense of solidarity – that the majority should use their collective power to force concessions from the powerful – was innately subversive, and needed to be replaced by an everyone-for-themselves inidualism. “It’s not the existence of classes that threatens the unity of the nation,” as one official Conservative party document put it in 1976, “but the existence of class feeling.” In other words, even to discuss social class meant asking searching questions about why some have wealth and power that go beyond believing that those at the top somehow deserved to be there.It is this worldview that underpins so many policy assumptions. Taxes should be slashed for the rich, because they amassed their wealth through their superior talents and hard efforts. The welfare state should be rolled back, because it merely incentivises the fecklessness and aversion to work that exists among the poor. It is even the rationale used to argue that buildings burn and kill dozens of predominantly working-class people not because flammable cladding was chosen because it was cheaper, or because fire sprinklers weren’t in place because that costs money, but because the victims lacked common sense or leadership skills.It is this sense of class chauvinism that led, in part, to Grenfell – because who truly thinks that if the tower was full of luxury apartments filled with City slickers and hedge-fund managers that this would have ever happened? So, let’s not dismiss Rees-Mogg’s utterances as gaffes. This is how they see the world: it is the very foundation of their politics. As the Tories pin their election hopes on working-class communities in the North and Midlands, this eternal truth needs to be remembered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fff6ea3383ce194307023543e7d0fe797fadb4/0_138_3843_2307/master/3843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e5bfc27975204c9c03e918a3d5e88a7","title":"the guardian view on tory election plans the mask is slipping already","story":"Boris Johnson promises to lead a ‘one-nation’ Conservative government, but events of the past week expose the improbability of that claimAn early casualty of any general election campaign is perspective. News cycles accelerate, the volume goes up and it becomes difficult to detect a clear signal about what is happening amid the noise. Those caveats must accompany the observation that the Conservative campaign has had an inauspicious start.Among the items making headlines: Downing Street obstructing the release of a report on Russian interference in British elections, raising suspicion that its contents compromise the Conservatives Jacob Rees-Mogg causing distress by suggesting that victims of the Grenfell Tower fire defied “common sense” in following fire service advice Tory backbench MP Andrew Bridgen aggravating the offence, implying that Mr Rees-Mogg’s comments express the superiority of his intellect.Meanwhile, chancellor Sajid Javid had planned to seize the agenda with a document attacking Labour’s economic plans, using research carried out by the Treasury. He was thwarted by the cabinet secretary on grounds of civil service impartiality. That attack had been lined up for the morning of Boris Johnson’s official campaign launch. By lunchtime, the Welsh secretary, Alun Cairns, had resigned over his association with a Tory Welsh assembly candidate accused of sabotaging a rape trial to help the defendant.These setbacks would challenge the sang-froid of the most confident candidate. But Mr Johnson is an experienced campaigner and – belying his disorderly appearance – a disciplined one. His method is to affect a loose, spontaneous style without, in reality, deviating from a strategically focused script. The message, delivered in front of No 10 on Wednesday, is that parliament has thwarted Brexit but the Conservatives will unblock it – and a bounty of investment. There would follow “moderate and compassionate one-nation Conservative government”.That is surely the shrewd place for a Tory candidate to stand, but that doesn’t mean Mr Johnson can hold the ground. A small rash of bad headlines might not swing many votes on 12 December, but they highlight the big strategic challenge for the prime minister, which is that the party he leads does not look like the one described in his campaign. It keeps declaring itself instead to be immoderate, lacking in compassion, and indifferent to the views and experiences of much of the nation.The callous, arrogant remarks made by Mr Rees-Mogg will match many voters’ intuitive sense of who the Tories are – and whose side they are on – better than anything Mr Johnson claims they want to be. MPs who are truer to the party’s one-nation tradition have been standing down. The next intake has been selected by local associations with instincts closer to the hardline agenda pioneered by Mr Rees-Mogg. It is reasonable for the electorate to expect that those values and priorities, not a more moderate manifesto, will shape the Downing Street agenda under a Tory majority government.That expectation exposes another contradiction in Mr Johnson’s position. His campaign is based on the idea that Brexit can be “done” swiftly, acknowledging that voters are fed up with the whole thing. But Brexit is also the consuming passion of his party – its animating purpose since 2016. When the prime minister recognises that the public is sick of Brexit he is admitting, unwittingly perhaps, that many are sick of the Tories too. It is risky for an incumbent to call so directly for a change of national tune.With five more weeks yet to run, it is impossible to foresee the trajectory of the campaign. Mr Johnson is not in control of events, as the past week has shown. He might well fulfil the high expectations set by a pattern of opinion poll leads. But if he fails, hindsight will find the flaws and contradictions that weakened his candidacy well advertised in the opening days of his campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8413f5cfa32b058d9d4f017e757d91e18accde12/86_382_3998_2399/master/3998.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3effe36cbefce7eba8875027c1639683","title":"ive never been good at banter but i cant deny insulting someone is a great way to bond","story":"Sledging, ribbing, teasing – these are all subjective terms, so you have to be careful it doesn’t become bullyingI’ve never been good at banter. If you are, you know my type: when a group full of friends is playfully teasing each other, I’m the one laughing a little bit too loudly, eyes brimming with tears.Maybe it’s my over-sensitivity, or the fact I spent my childhood in Canada, where I never noticed these dynamics (compared to Australia, where my Aussie relatives would regularly take the piss out of me while my face flushed), but I’ve always been bad at it. Growing up, I never understood it.Unsurprisingly, there is no clear line. The word “banter” is tossed around on dating profiles as a desirable trait and crops up everywhere from friendship groups to sporting teams. Earlier this year, Australian cricket captain Justin Langer said “If I play Uno with my daughter there’s lots of banter. We sort of sledge each other but we don’t abuse each other.”A father and daughter teasing one another over a card game is fun. In a workplace, of course, things become murkier. And nobody wants to be a buzzkill. Lawyer and manager of a commercial law firm Lisa Klug alludes to the grey area of joking in the workplace, saying intention is irrelevant if someone is deemed to have been bullied. She notes the Australian guidelines in each state that highlight when behaviour becomes bullying (some examples of behaviours crossing the line include pranks, humiliation through sarcasm, cruel nicknames, teasing).Sledging, ribbing, teasing – these are all subjective terms. And while it may be slightly more black and white in a workplace, it’s still murky. One person’s banter is another person’s bullying. As adults, we hopefully become aware of the difference between a social and professional environment. But when you’re a kid at school, that’s years away, and the school ground is your entire world.I threw a few questions to writer and comedian James Colley to get the viewpoint of a Professional Funny Man (™). James agreed that it’s not easy to draw a line between shitty comments and “mucking around”, but “just because it isn’t easy doesn’t mean it’s not important,” he told me. From a stand-up’s point of view, “a good comedian in any sense can read their audience and if the bit you are doing is purely for your own joy and not for theirs then it’s no longer a good bit.”For non-professionals, if this kind of communication doesn’t come naturally, like anything – practice makes perfect. James tells me his humour came from being a defence mechanism (hard same).“Learning the difference between a good laugh and a bad laugh takes time and it takes self-reflection. I wouldn’t be where I am today were I not standing on a pile of regret.” Cheers to that!Despite my fragile skin, I can’t deny that playfully insulting – or being insulted by – someone is a great way to bond. When done correctly, it’s funI recently realised my friends at work were my friends when we could take the piss out of one another. It’s the sort of conversation I couldn’t transpose verbatim because it would make us look barbaric. I started to, but nothing ruins a joke faster than earnest analysis, and besides – who has the word count to explain why someone dry-retching when I mention I’m bisexual is so funny?Maybe growing up is part of it, not necessarily ageing, but reaching a stage where you know who you are and can therefore take yourself less seriously. I’m no longer insecure about my sexuality, so can joke about it. Perhaps for some lucky young people they reach this stage of self-discovery at school, for others (like me) it’s a lot later.Enjoying banter doesn’t mean everything is a joke, either. We all know the feeling of someone dismissing an offensive remark as “having a laugh” – to summarise, it sucks. Whether it’s a stand-up’s punchline or friend’s off-hand comment, these things can hurt.Empathy, sense of self, context. Reading cues from other people and knowing when to apologise are key components to being a decent human. All these concepts are generally easier to navigate within friendships – is this why banter works so well with mates?James agrees that familiarity is part of what makes good banter good, but that it doesn’t all boil down to friendship. “Familiarity helps, for sure. There’s an element of ‘woah, we don’t know each other like that’ when it’s a stranger. I think what’s most important is that it’s fun for both parties.”And if you’re the only one laughing ... “When it’s one-sided, I don’t think it is banter. It may disguise itself as such but it’s destructive.”• Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on SBS Comedy, Junkee, the ABC and the Sydney Morning Herald"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61c7da9bf7d8d978f7393b0f3b0c11eaf9c2e7e5/0_32_5308_3185/master/5308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c7ae8fab1fd4a33836362143767c7d","title":"children should spend an hour a day in wild says wildlife trusts","story":"Government urged to create spaces where young people can connect with natural worldPrimary schoolchildren should spend at least one hour a day learning and playing in wild places to help improve their wellbeing and confidence, a leading conservation organisation has said.The Wildlife Trusts, which represents 46 local organisations and 2,300 nature reserves in the UK, has called on the next government to create a network of wild spaces where young people are free to climb trees, learn about wildlife and connect with the natural world while at school.Outdoor teaching in the UK should be used to help children develop a personal connection with nature and pursue their own passions, whether it be searching for frog spawn, building dens or climbing trees, according the the organisation.The recommendations follow a study for the trust by the Institute of Education, part of University College London (UCL), which found strong positive benefits for the self-worth and confidence of primary schoolchildren after taking part in activities in wild places.The conservation organisation said an hour a day outdoors for all British children aged four to 11 would help re-establish the connection between young people and nature in the UK.For the study, UCL researchers found the overwhelming majority of children surveyed had learned something about the natural world, felt more confident and had better relationships with their classmates after spending time outdoors.The academics surveyed 451 children in 12 areas across England before and after participating in activities ran by a wildlife trust like identifying plants and trees, also interviewing teachers and Wildlife Trust educators.Nigel Doar, the Wildlife Trusts’ director of strategy, said: “This research shows that children experience profound and erse benefits through regular contact with nature. Contact with the wild improves children’s wellbeing, motivation and confidence. The data also highlights how children’s experiences in and around the natural world led to better relationships with their teachers and classmates.“The Wildlife Trusts believe everyone should have the opportunity to experience the joy of wildlife in daily life and we’re calling on government to recognise the multiple benefits of nature for children – and ensure that at least one hour per school day is spent outdoors learning and playing in wild places.”Prof Michael Reiss, Institute of Education, UCL, said: “Each generation seems to have less contact with the outdoors than the preceding one. We owe it to all young people to reverse this trend – for their sakes, for our sakes and for nature’s sake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9abc54701c62dc30a96bc9641a11c465bcafea2/949_0_2561_1537/master/2561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3836e58a24ee308b357b6f0fa41288","title":"john lewis trucks to run on carbon neutral cow manure","story":"Retailer will use renewable biomethane, supplied by CNG Fuels, from 2021Hundreds of John Lewis delivery trucks will begin running on cow power from 2021 as the retailer weans its fleet off polluting diesel fuel and switches to carbon-neutral cow manure.The retailer will begin using renewable biomethane made from manure slurry for almost 300 John Lewis and Waitrose delivery vans under new plans from its fuel supplier to swap rotting vegetables for poo power at no extra cost.John Lewis currently runs 80 vans on biomethane from food waste, but plans to expand its green fleet by up to 200 vans within the next 18 months before switching to manure.The company’s fuel supplier, CNG Fuels, said it also planned to use the manure-based fuel to supply the 200-strong fleet of trucks used by courier service Hermes, as well as the delivery vans of Asda and Argos.A spokesman for CNG said the majority of the manure used to make the fuel would be sourced from cows, but the slurry might include human sewage too.But biofuel made from manure is considered carbon-neutral under EU law because it helps stop methane – a greenhouse gas which is 28 times more potent than CO2 – being released into the atmosphere.The supplier is also looking at ways to update its network of heavy vehicle fuelling stations to include low-carbon hydrogen and powerful battery charging options.Philip Fjeld, the chief executive of CNG Fuels, said: “Renewable biomethane sourced from manure is currently the best low-carbon solution for HGVs, but we want to be ready to support our customers when other technologies are commercially viable for freight transport.”John Lewis announced last year that it planned to switch all its heavy delivery trucks to biomethane-powered versions by 2028. The overhaul will include rolling out over 500 state-of-the-art Waitrose \u0026amp Partners and John Lewis \u0026amp Partners delivery trucks powered by renewable biomethane fuel.Once converted, the new fleet will save more than 49,000 tonnes of carbon emissions every year, or the equivalent carbon footprint of just over 6,000 UK households."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2037c5ac87ff7c909c0d488a6c5efac91f71374d/0_52_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92542d108f4b7140c4644435752fab60","title":"majority of uk public back 2030 zero carbon target poll","story":"A majority of the UK public and almost half of Conservative voters support a radical plan to transform the economy and tackle the climate crisis, a poll suggests.The findings appear to highlight a growing awareness of the scale of the climate crisis and the increasingly radical policy solutions the public is willing to support.Last week a separate survey found that the climate emergency would influence how most people vote, with almost two-thirds agreeing it was the biggest issue facing humankind.Labour wants the UK to hit zero carbon by 2030 as part of its Green Industrial Revolution agenda, and the Liberal Democrats have set a target of 2045.Aliya Yule, a co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, which campaigned for Labour to adopt the 2030 target, said the polling showed next month’s vote was becoming the UK’s first “climate election”.“The figures demonstrate the huge public appetite for rapid and radical government action on climate change,” he said.Yule said only Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution plans – which aim to tie radical action on the environment to huge job creation and housing upgrade schemes – would address the scale of the crisis.“Not even Conservative voters support the Tories’ net zero 2050 target. They have no credibility on climate change, not even with their own supporters,” he added.This week student and pensioner groups called on the leaders of all the main parties to take part in a televised leaders’ debate on the climate. All agreed except for Boris Johnson, who did not respond.Noga Levy-Rapoport, a participant in the youth climate strikes, said: “This general election is our last chance to face up to the climate crisis. The public clearly support the most ambitious targets to decarbonise.“Parties should respond in kind by offering a Green New Deal which rapidly reduces emissions while improving living standards and expanding services like free bus travel.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c360b6db88dd12f0f8eafa47bba9c28f98bf0c38/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=393fa324178e44eddef16bb0d0466dbf","title":"the guardians climate pledge 2019","story":"We want the  to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe.

It’s directed by Harvey’s friend, photojournalist Seamus Murphy, who she travels with on research field trips to Afghanistan, Kosovo and low-income black neighbourhoods of Washington DC. But the film’s political engagement is oddly wishy-washy, while fans hungry for intimate access to the singer will leave frustrated – Murphy politely respects Harvey’s cool, emotionally reserved public persona.In Washington, Harvey meets Paunie, a teenage girl who dresses like a boy and commands total respect on the street. (It’s Paunie’s dog, Money, that gives the film the title.) In Kosovo, an elderly woman keeps the keys of neighbours who fled the village during the war (and presumably won’t be coming back). Murphy shoots with compassion and journalistic curiosity, his camera inching closer and closer to the face of a boy in Washington who is explaining how his dad, cousin and friend were all shot dead on the same block – two murders, one suicide.Harvey is mostly a watchful observer with a notebook sometimes she reads lines of poetry she’s jotted down on the voiceover. But we barely see her interacting with anyone on the ground, which gives the whole thing an impersonal feel. And there are patience-testing scenes of the album being recorded in Somerset House, London, as members of the public look on.But it’s here, in a throwaway line, that we get what might be the most revealing moment in the film, as a musician tells an anecdote about Harvey recording her previous album, Let England Shake.

But with only six words in his latest film, Anna Paquin’s moral spectre is a sign of a troubling trend in HollywoodWhen Anna Paquin joined the cast of Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, it seemed like a decent break for the actor who has flown under the radar since her days as the half-vampire Sookie Stackhouse on True Blood. Paquin’s was the only big female name alongside the likes of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci and a myriad of other recognisable male stars – an anomaly that held the promise of a particularly meaty female role (if Scorsese’s gangster flicks serve as evidence).But even though The Irishman never suggests it would prominently feature its female characters, few could have anticipated quite how absent its most important female figure is.Played by Paquin as an adult woman and Lucy Gallina as a child, Peggy Sheeran is the daughter of De Niro’s hitman, Frank Sheeran. A practically mute, moral spectre judging her father’s criminal lifestyle from the sidelines, she appears only a handful of times – less than 10 minutes in total. The Irishman’s narrative revolves around Frank’s imperfect recollections of when he first became involved with the Italian mafia in his 40s through to his present day in a nursing home. Within these boundaries, Peggy is disconcertingly diminished: Paquin speaks six words in a movie that clocks in at three-and-a-half hours. There may be a potency to such intentional restraint within the film’s elegiac trappings, yet circumscribing Peggy as Frank’s moral conscience remains doggedly frustrating. Is she more of a symbol than an actual person?While not exactly gender progressive, Scorsese’s testosterone-fuelled gangster movies have carved out provocative roles for women. Take, for example, Lorraine Bracco’s complicit mob wife in Goodfellas. Along with her protagonist husband, Henry, Bracco’s Karen Hill is given the narrative space to air her grievances and articulate her desires in stretches of voiceover narration – helping to outline the private and public consequences of Henry’s criminal enterprise. Ginger in Casino, meanwhile, may fit too neatly into the femme fatale archetype, but Sharon Stone’s physically committed performance – from poised hustler to woman on the edge, brought down by addiction and avarice – is one of the film’s memorable elements.But Paquin’s Peggy is markedly different from the female roles of Scorsese gangster films past she is more a tool for expressing the protagonist’s moral blindness, and a vehicle that primes audiences to feel certain ways about other characters, rather than a fully drawn person. As a child, Peggy learns to avoid her father after witnessing a brutal episode that demonstrates his capacity for violence. She openly disdains his shady friend and employer, Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), whom she understands on some instinctive level is a villain and her father’s corruptor she rebuffs his attempts to win her favour with Christmas cash and ice skates. Instead, Peggy prefers the company of impassioned and personable labour union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and his warm, if flawed, paternal instincts.As an adult, Peggy’s taciturn presence is an implicit condemnation of the film’s degraded masculine worldview. The nail in the coffin of Peggy and Frank’s relationship is Paquin’s only spoken line in the film, a six-word question that has Peggy confronting her father after his act of betrayal.Paquin’s comically low line-count is reminiscent of criticism of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why was Margot Robbie, an Academy Award-nominated actress, given so much less dialogue than her male counterparts? The question was not unwarranted. After all, Robbie’s Sharon Tate is the beating heart of Quentin Tarantino’s unexpectedly tender tale of historical revisionism. The suggestion that Tarantino short-shrifted Robbie spawned a debate that lasted through the summer. Is Tarantino’s Tate an objectified male fantasy? Or is she a triumphantly humanised depiction of a woman whose legacy has been defined by the tragic circumstances of her death? Are the women in Tarantino’s dude-heavy films empowered or problematically rendered? In any case, women in The Irishman are moral reminders and checks on an inward looking all-male reality. So much of The Irishman’s final act has us yearning for Peggy’s final thoughts, for Paquin to take the stage once and for all in some sort of cathartic fashion. But we get no such closure, condemned like Frank to a dreary purgatory of what could have been. Perhaps Scorsese too readily buys into the symbolic potency of women as moral beacons. Peggy’s role is trimmed to a sliver of silent glances by the blinkered, perhaps repressed memories of her aged father – an easy cop-out for reducing her significance to mere phantom guilt trip with feminine charms.If Scorsese’s filmography has taught us anything, it’s that women are too often caught in the crosshairs of the world of men, whether as victims or cunning culprits, as jezebels or slaves to love. But in opting out of her father’s world, Peggy contextualises the heartlessness and cruelty of the like-minded men (and women) who have so long fascinated the film-maker. Instead, Peggy gestures at an alternative, which strikes me as more than the disgruntled rejection of “daddy’s little girl”, rather hinting at an entire generational disenchantment. If only she were given the flesh and bones to fully bring to life this subtle revolutionary element."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d328d0b56cb653ec090661473fe5a1d100b30983/263_0_3154_1894/master/3154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfda2b9d34425afa1db38364098d58c1","title":"why martin scorseses the irishman wont be coming to a cinema near you","story":"Major cinemas around the world are not screening the film, whose early Netflix release date they see as an existential threatIf there was ever a sign that cinema-going was becoming a niche experience, it must be that a major feature directed by one of the godfathers of modern film will grace only a handful of big screens around the world.Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, a crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, is not the first likely blockbuster to bypass wide theatrical release before heading to the binge-box of home entertainment, but it is perhaps the most notable – and it’s sparked a coordinated response from cinema operators internationally, who see the rise of the streaming giants as an existential threat.The $159m film and passion project for Scorsese was financed by Netflix after years of languishing in development. The director wrote in the New York Times earlier this week that Netflix “alone allowed us to make The Irishman the way we needed to”. But when it came time to broker a deal with distributors for theatrical release, parties couldn’t agree.Traditionally, cinemas have demanded a 90-day window between theatrical release and on-demand availability, essentially giving them the first exclusive bite of the revenue pie. But negotiations between the NetflixScorsese team and two major US cinema chains, AMC Theatres and Cineplex, fell apart earlier this year when Netflix reportedly wanted that window closed to 45 days at most.Other major cinema chains in the UK and Europe followed suit. The Irishman is reported to have opened in only eight cinemas in New York and Los Angeles. The trend has also spread to Australia, where the only cinemas to be showing the film will be “independent” chains such as Dendy and Classic cinemas – companies that have a stronger market in niche fare than major multiplexes like Village and Hoyts.The Irishman is not the only film to have broken the 90-day rule. Last year’s Oscar-winning Roma, for example, had a three-week run in cinemas before becoming available on Netflix. But whether due to the auteur’s prestige or whether cinemas have hit peak frustration at streaming services’ encroachment on traditional box office revenue, the bite-back from the industry has been sharp.Last week, the president of the US cinema industry association, John Fithian, called the outcome of the negotiations in the US a “disgrace”.“Netflix is facing a challenge to their business model for the first time and missed a strategic opportunity,” he told the Hollywood Reporter.“The point of an exclusive theatrical window is for movies to reach their full commercial potential. Netflix chose to artificially limit The Irishman’s theatrical release,” he said. “They sent a signal to filmmakers that even if you’re Martin Scorsese, you won’t get the wide theatrical release you want through Netflix.”His Australian counterpart, David Seargeant, chairman of the National Association of Cinema Operators (NACO), told Inside Film in October: “Several exhibitors, who are not our members, are taking a short-term view and showing films without an appropriate theatrical season.”If it’s preferable for films funded by streaming companies to go straight to the home, why bother with theatrical release at all? Part of the answer is acclaim: eligibility for major accolades such as the Academy Awards is still tied to first release in cinema. There’s also an aesthetic consideration: films made for TV are structurally different to those made for the proportions of a cinema screen. And for the right films, extraordinary profits can still be made from those public showings – as Marvel, and its parent company Disney, have shown.Scorsese’s recent comments about the lack of “revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger” of those massive Marvel films – opinions he first expressed in October – were accompanied by a more general lamentation about the state of cinema today.“Every new Hitchcock picture was an event. To be in a packed house in one of the old theatres watching Rear Window was an extraordinary experience: It was an event created by the chemistry between the audience and the picture itself, and it was electrifying,” Scorsese wrote, while simultaneously acknowledging that filmmakers like himself were hamstrung between wanting to make films for that collective, aesthetic experience of the theatre, while also being required to follow the funding.It’s a justification some smaller cinema operators, many of whom aren’t members of the industry association NACO, have made for showing Netflix’s films, despite the bigger players showing a united front. Australian indie chain Dendy, for example, plans to release other Netflix films – including The King, Marriage Story and The Two Popes – ahead of their on-demand release, despite many of them breaking the 90-day window.“Consumers want to see niche and alternative content on our cinema screens,” says Scott Mota from Dendy, explaining their decision to screen the films. But it’s a decision they might not always be able to make. Once the 90-day window breaks and the precedent is set for shorter theatrical runs, cinemas fear their box office takings will suffer – and so will the chances of many more films making it to the big screen at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ece9046fb6a4283ef7fc2a87a9a0ae6d6951e438/0_819_4744_2847/master/4744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e35620a9e5ca8a6aa913ebe3034c0f09","title":"bake off winner david atherton i enjoy the buns innuendos","story":"He won GBBO with a reputation for being calm, tidy and methodical. But the star baker says in reality he’s an extrovert hippy who hasn’t washed his hair in 15 years – and another contestant tested one of his bakesHe’s the quiet, controlled one who wowed the judges with precise technical bakes. At least, that’s the impression you probably have of the 2019 Great British Bake Off winner, David Atherton. Wrong. In person, he’s an adventurous extrovert with a hippy streak. “Most of my practices I did in my pants while eating pizza and watching RuPaul’s Drag Race. The person in the edit is not me,” he says. “At the end, it showed me singing to myself and dancing around, but actually I did that the whole way through. I am calm and methodical, but I’m not particularly reserved.”Atherton’s triumph – he didn’t win a showstopper while the hotly tipped finalist Steph Blackwell was star baker four times – is all the more remarkable because he was a reserve applicant (as was his co-finalist Alice Fevronia), drafted in to replace a dropout just two weeks before the show began. Yet the 36-year-old health adviser is such an experienced and confident cook (“Ottolenghi is my absolute hero,” he says, and he is a big fan of baker Dan Lepard), he didn’t panic or even change any social plans. “The weekend before the show, I decided to cycle to Paris. It was good for my headspace.”A fitness fanatic, he had made his stunning snake cake only once before the opening show. “My thought was that if you’ve tried something and it’s worked, don’t keep on practising it, because if you try it again and it doesn’t work, it’s just going to stress you out. A lot of Bake Off is your mental strength.”He thought dessert week might be his undoing. “Sweet, fancy, fluffy desserts are not my thing. I like robust flavours and hearty bakes. I like breads. If I do a cake, I want it to be a carrot cake. If I do biscuits, I want them to be spicy.”Judge Paul Hollywood wasn’t initially a fan of his flavours. “Paul has, I think, quite simple tastes. He likes really obvious flavours – chocolate and caramel and raspberry and white chocolate and lemon.” Yet Atherton won a handshake and is happy to return the compliment: “He’s very technical. I always agreed with their constructive criticisms. He was really helpful with tips. He must enjoy teaching because he’s really good at that.”While all around him were dropping their creations or gasping as they ran out of time, the cheerful, unfazed Atherton always seemed to finish with a few moments to clean his workbench. Is he really this perfect – prissy even – in real life?Not at all. “I’m not that clean and tidy. I don’t like showering. I never wear shoes. I’ve not washed my hair in more than 15 years. I didn’t go to a hairdresser until I was about 28. I think these things are healthy.“I’m very hippy and outdoorsy. I love talking about my bowels and anything disgusting and medical.”His Bake Off persona only shows a sliver of his interests – and hardly nods to his adventures. A trained nurse, he lives in south London and works for Voluntary Services Overseas. He has a post-graduate degree in wilderness and expedition medicine. And he has travelled around Africa, living in Malawi for two years. “I left home at 18 and went to Côte d’Ivoire. I’ve been evacuated from two wars, once by the British special forces, once by the Americans. I went to Ethiopia when it was in a state of emergency and 10,000 people were arrested. I was in Nigeria during massive demonstrations and we were in lockdown for three days. I’ve had malaria nine times. I’ve been quarantined in a shack in New Guinea for a week because I got a violent strain of measles. I’ve lived in a lot of countries and I really like that adventurous lifestyle.”No wonder he didn’t flap under pressure in the tent. What about the comments that he looked arrogant? “I was never smug. You’re so nervous that whatever your face is, it’s probably just you trying to be composed. I didn’t know I pouted, but I do. Get over it.”One of five children, Atherton was brought up by strict evangelical parents in Whitby, North Yorkshire. “We weren’t allowed to watch TV. There was a period where we were allowed to watch one programme a day and you had to circle it in the Radio Times. We had breakfast every morning as a family of seven and my dad did a bible study and everyone had to pray at the end. Some of the things were so nice. We’d play board games and do crafts and cooking together. It was a very loving family and we spent a lot of time together.”His mother was health-conscious and cooked from scratch. As a result, Atherton grew up vegetarian, without a potato waffle in sight. “In our lunchbox we never had crisps or chocolate biscuits, it would be nuts and seeds. Figs and prunes would be our sweet things. Carrot sticks. We never had butter or margarine. We never had icing on our cakes.“For my mum, making bread was a way of keeping us busy. She would make the dough and we would play with it like Play-Doh. She would make rolls and we would make rabbits, cats and crocodiles.”His grandmother taught him to sew, knit and crochet. In the living room of the small flat he has just moved into with his boyfriend, Nik, he proudly shows me the practical but stylish things he has crafted: a quilt, bowls and platters (“my Ottolenghi salad plates”), a table and bench (“Honestly, it took about 20 minutes”).He met Nik, a brand manager who helps him with social media, on a dating site. They are both into fitness. “Our second date was a 100km London to Brighton bike ride. When he agreed to that, I was: ‘Brilliant, this is it.’ We did it not realising it was the big charity one, which was great because all the roads were closed.”Atherton came out seven years ago by writing to his parents. He chose this method, he says, to give them time to process the news. “The reaction that someone might have from it being sprung on them might not be the reaction they’d want to have if they’d considered it. You’ve been thinking about it for ages, but it’s new for them. I told my parents in a letter and said: ‘Speak to my twin brother before you speak to me because he wants to be able to answer certain questions first that might seem offensive to me.’ They took it very well.” He loves the fact that LGBT teenagers now contact him for advice, but is aware of the irony. “They say I’m an inspiration, but I didn’t come out until I was 29. But they’re seeing me after that, where I don’t live with shame any more. I’m really happy. Shame just eats away at you. I encourage people that the soonest time it’s right for them, they should come out, because I didn’t do that and so many people you speak to wish they’d done it earlier.”He says he was frustrated at being “a little bit objectified” early on in Bake Off – “in certain episodes, I felt like I was just a sexual innuendo” – but admits he loves the attention he has been getting since it aired. “In general, I enjoy the buns innuendos. A lot of it is really funny. I mean, I did wear tight trousers every week. It’s not like I wasn’t also playing up to this.”He would have liked to wear tight shorts and a vest, but it wasn’t allowed. “Apparently armpit hair doesn’t look nice on TV. I think it’s more health and safety, because I said I’d shave my armpits.”His admirers have certainly been upfront. There are lots of fans in the US, where the show has also aired. “The gay Brits are definitely more dirty. The Americans are: ‘You’re awesome.’ The Brits are: ‘I want to fill you with my buttercream.’ I’ve not just had dick pics, I’ve had videos of people masturbating.”Aside from the Bake Off innuendo, there were real friendships on show. Atherton, Henry Bird and Michael Chakraverty formed a “least laddy lads’ club” (with Fevronia an honorary member) that lives on through Instagram. “We would ring each other during the week as things went wrong. I’m not embarrassed to say that Henry practised one of my bakes for me – the Aperol domed tart. It was my recipe, but I didn’t have time. He’d gone out the week before and had time to do everything. He sent exhaustive notes. Every two or three minutes were accounted for.”Atherton thinks this “camaraderie between the bakers” brought a warmth to the show. “You could see that we were helping each other and people weren’t really very competitive. I think that helped, especially in the climate of ision and Brexit. I think the public have really liked that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/535c66550edac692c9c3b6fe84184085eb2ee2ab/0_1267_8815_5290/master/8815.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90864320105fd0cfe887da6f92d5de7b","title":"how to cook the perfect nasi goreng recipe","story":"Indonesian fried rice is one of the all-time great comfort foods, but has more variations than Indonesia has islands. So what’s the best recipe?Though there are many worthy contenders for the title, all right-thinking people surely agree that fried rice is the very best kind of rice. And the Indonesian version, nasi goreng, is right up there in the top tier – “one of the world’s great comfort foods”, according to Rick Stein, who developed a taste for it while filming there with a crew who apparently preferred to start the day with a full English. Jakarta-born food writer Pat Tanumihardja explains that it’s the use of kecap manis (Indonesian soy sauce) and terasi (Indonesian shrimp paste) that “sets nasi goreng apart from other fried-rice variations you’ll see in other countries”.Not that there’s just one version of nasi goreng, obviously a country made up of more than 14,000 islands contains multitudes in this respect as much as any other: there’s nasi goreng kambing with mutton, nasi goreng ayam with chicken, and nasi goreng gila, or crazy fried rice, which can apparently contain anything the cook happens to have to hand, from corned beef to sausages. But for those of us without easy access to Indonesia’s many night markets and street stalls, what’s the best way to make it at home?Clearly, the most important ingredient, and all the recipes I try call for long-grained varieties, occasionally basmati, but more often jasmine, which goes slightly sticky when cooked, making it easier to eat. That should, in theory, also make it less satisfactory for stir-frying, but actually, as long as you break up any clumps beforehand, this tacky plumpness makes for a very alluring texture. So, though you can use just about any rice you like, jasmine is my preference.The prevailing wisdom with fried rice is that you need to let the rice cool completely first, with Tanumihardja recommending using day-old rice for this purpose, and Indonesian food writer and cook Sri Owen telling readers of her Rice Book to let it cool for at least two hours before use. Some recipes, however, such as Meera Sodha’s in East, use freshly cooked rice – and, to my surprise, this works just fine. As Serious Eats’ J Kenji López-Alt, who has investigated the subject with characteristic rigour, explains, as cooked rice ages, it dries out, which means it’ll fry more quickly and is less likely to stick together – he recommends leaving it under a fan for an hour, but says even freshly cooked rice spread out on a tray to cool slightly before use is superior to drier, day-old rice, which has a tendency to go hard and chewy in a hot wok. Personally, I rather like a few rogue, crunchy grains, but still, it’s good to know that a sudden craving for fried rice isn’t necessarily a hiding to disappointment.Owen uses a mixture of oil and butter, which is hard to prevent burning at such a high heat. If you’d like butter in there – though it doesn’t seem to be common, as far as I can tell – add it at the end: a neutral oil seems the best bet for stir-frying.Almost every recipe starts with some sort of onion – whether yellow, as in Owen’s version and Eleanor Ford’s in Fire Islands red as in Sodha’s or shallots as in Rick Stein, Jennifer Joyce and Tanumihardja’s recipes – and garlic. My testers and I like the sweetness of the shallots, but red onion makes a good substitute, with some fresh spring onion stirred in at the end as in Ford, Stein and Anissa Helou’s recipes.Chillies are also vital, both medium and mild and small and vicious, though Tanumihardja suggests stirring in some sambal oelek, or tangy Indonesian chilli paste instead. Helou makes her own sambal bajak, a brick-red mixture of fried chillies, shallots, palm sugar, bay leaves, lemongrass, galangal, tamarind and nutmeg, which gives her dish a lovely, warm sweetness. Stein, meanwhile, gives us a recipe that starts with a Balinese spice paste made from pepper, nutmeg, candlenuts, sesame seeds, shallots, ginger, galangal, turmeric, (pauses for breath) lemongrass, garlic, chillies, shrimp paste, palm sugar, salt, lime juice and oil.Almost all the recipes come garnished with a fried egg (which is why nasi goreng is the best of all fried rices). But some also incorporate eggs in other forms: Grigson goes for strips of omelette, while Helou cracks an egg directly into the wok, explaining that William Wongso, Indonesia’s foremost celebrity chef, reckons it must brown on the base “to release the aroma” before adding the rice. I’m with him egg-fried rice is never a bad idea.Fried eggs are the classic choice, but sliced cucumber and tomato are also popular, the cucumber in particular adding a soothing crunch. Prawn crackers are also sometimes used as a secondary piece of cutlery. Crispy shallots, of the kind sold in south-east Asian food stores, are a great idea. Grigson’s salted peanuts and banana are perhaps more leftfield choices, but as I have not, as yet, been lucky enough to visit Indonesia, I’m unable to pronounce on their popularity in the field, so I’ll just say anchovies and banana is not a combination I’m keen to repeat.200g jasmine rice 2 tbsp neutral oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 eggs, beaten2 tbsp kecap manis2 tsp soy sauce4 spring onions1 bird’s eye chilli, sliced, to serveFor the paste50g shallots, peeled and roughly chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2 tsp Indonesian shrimp paste (terasi)1 large medium red chilli, deseeded1 tbsp neutral oilOptional toppingsFried eggsSliced cucumber or tomatoesLightly blanched vegetablesCooked meat or seafoodCrispy shallotsSalted peanutsPut the rice in a pan with 400ml boiling water.

Ederson has a muscle problem in a thigh and Pep Guardiola does not know if his No 1 will be available for the trip to Anfield on Sunday. Given Bravo’s rush of blood – he is the first substitute goalkeeper to get a red card in the competition – the manager will surely not want to be without Ederson.Guardiola made five changes from the win against Southampton on Saturday, notably leaving out John Stones and Sergio Agüero, perhaps with an eye on Liverpool. Atalanta’s Gewiss stadium in Bergamo does not meet Uefa regulations so this Group C match was staged at the San Siro, and their fans were vocal throughout.What they saw at the start was an Ilkay Gündogan error lead to Hans Hateboer being found at the far post. Ederson was stranded but the midfielder failed to find the net.Moments later City created a beautiful opener. Bernardo Silva moved along the left and drilled the ball in to Gabriel Jesus. He backheeled slickly to Raheem Sterling and the forward beat Pierluigi Gollini for his 18th goal of the campaign. The goal plus Atalanta’s penchant for attacking meant the contest was already open, which suits how Guardiola’s men like to play. Yet for a while they were loose. Benjamin Mendy spooned a pass to no one, Ederson kicked the ball out of play, and Jesus was dispossessed with ease.This was partly due to Atalanta’s workrate, but when City suddenly pounced they came close to doubling the lead. Gündogan fed Riyad Mahrez and his cross from the right rolled before Gollini and would only have required a toe from Jesus – or someone else – to make it two.Gündogan’s next act was to flick the ball to a galloping Kevin De Bruyne on the right. After advancing he pulled back to Sterling but his attempt was blocked by Hateboer. Soon City’s scorer was in along the same corridor but when he fired the ball across goal Bernardo Silva could not quite add the finish. Moments later, Jesus’s strength allowed him to tap on to Mahrez and following a burst of pace plus a drop of the shoulder his effort was saved low down to the left by Gollini.Despite his side largely cruising Guardiola will have been frustrated at it still only being 1-0 at the interval, especially given what immediately preceded it. When Rafael Toloi pulled back Sterling the defender was booked and the referee, Aleksei Kulbakov, waited for a VAR check on a penalty.Sterling was adjudged to have been outside the area and no penalty was awarded. But after his subsequent free-kick hit Ilicic’s arm the referee consulted a pitchside monitor and this time awarded a penalty. Jesus’s effort was dismal, however, missing the target to Gollini’s right.Ederson was replaced for the second half by Bravo and there was an early test for the Chilean when Ilicic raced in behind, and while this came to nothing Bravo would be beaten soon afterwards.Alejandro Gómez sprinted down the left and pinged a pinpoint cross on to Mario Pasalic’s head and he made no mistake. It was all very simple, and Jürgen Klopp, doubtlessly watching on Merseyside, may well have noted how easily City were breached.Guardiola hopped around, urging his team to find an extra gear. Ederson’s removal, though, unsettled City. Suddenly the home team were spraying passes around and City were chasing and trying to regain control.By the end they were hanging on, Walker thrown on following Bravo’s red card – a decision that took six minutes and VAR to arrive at. The right-back smiled as he pulled Bravo’s jersey on and his first act was to keep out a Ruslan Malinovskiy free-kick. Relief was City’s overriding emotion as they saw out a draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c8f8762b6ab976dc7837e8947813e6840f20a8/0_25_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43f19597adb9d9a0e87811c81422537b","title":"champions league roundup juventus bayern munich real madrid","story":"• Ramsey reacts fastest after Cristiano Ronaldo free-kick• Bayern Munich see off Olympiakos 2-0 to seal qualificationDouglas Costa scored a brilliant stoppage-time goal to give Juventus a 2-1 win away to Lokomotiv Moscow on Wednesday, which clinched their place in the Champions League round of 16 with two games to spare.Juventus went ahead when the Lokomotiv goalkeeper Guilherme allowed Cristiano Ronaldo’s powerful free kick to squirm through his legs and Aaron Ramsey touched the ball over the line after four minutes.Aleksei Miranchuk levelled eight minutes later for the Russian side, scoring from the rebound after his own header hit a post. The game was heading for a draw until Costa, a substitute, played a one-two with Gonzalo Higuaín, raced into the area and poked the ball past Guilherme.Bayern Munich clinched a place in the last 16 by beating Olympiakos 2-0 at home thanks to second-half goals from Robert Lewandowski and Ivan Perisic. Playing their first game since Niko Kovac was sacked after the 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern outplayed the Greek champions and Lewandowski finally broke the deadlock in the 69th minute.The Poland striker prodded home a cross from Kingsley Coman from close range to score his 21st goal of the season in all competitions and set the interim coach Hansi Flick on the way to victory in his first game since being put in charge. Perisic slammed the ball home with his first touch, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench.Teenager Rodrygo helped himself to a hat-trick as Real Madrid hit Galatasaray for six to edge towards the knockout phase.The 18-year-old Brazilian scored twice inside the opening seven minutes in his first appearance in the competition at the Bernabéu, and then completed his treble in injury time. The captain Sergio Ramos had earlier converted a 14th-minute penalty with Karim Benzema striking either side of half-time to reach 50 Champions League goals for the club in a 6-0 demolition job.Real will test their momentum against the Group A leaders Paris Saint-Germain when they head for Madrid later this month defending a perfect record. They took their tally to a maximum 12 points from four games with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Club Brugge courtesy of Maura Icardi’s 21st-minute effort, although they were indebted to keeper Keylor Navas, who saved Mbaye Diagne’s 76th-minute penalty.Bayer Leverkusen secured their first points of the campaign with a fine 2-1 home victory over previously unbeaten Atlético Madrid.They got their noses in front four minutes before the break courtesy of Atlético midfielder Thomas Partey’s own goal, and captain Kevin Volland doubled their advantage before Álvaro Morata pulled one back following Nadiem Amiri’s 84th-minute dismissal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39f44b74c846ce804b2d3c19496f62d22c8253d/0_94_3521_2112/master/3521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63c748c8abe739ac5bf1c17f8dd45838","title":"red star belgrade tottenham hotspur champions league match report","story":"Son Heung-min’s anguish at Everton on Sunday knew no bounds and it is no exaggeration to say that on Monday, as the guilt at his role in André Gomes’s horrific injury continued to consume him, the Tottenham forward could not even think about this Champions League test against Red Star Belgrade.Mauricio Pochettino and the Spurs dressing room closed ranks around him. They told him that in no logical world should his trip have led to such damage to Gomes’s ankle and they believed that the best medicine for Son was to get straight back into the saddle. There was no point in moping.On a night when Spurs registered their first away win of the season, it was Son who provided the cutting edge. His sixth and seventh goals of the season in the second half allowed his team to coast to a victory that has put the last 16 of the competition within touching distance. For them, the equation is simple. If they can beat Olympiakos at home in three weeks’ time they will reach the knockout rounds for the third season in succession.Spurs could temporarily forget their domestic woes as, not for the first time, the Champions League provided a tonic. Giovani Lo Celso, on his full debut for Spurs, scored the first goal, a moment that embellished a performance of no little slickness, and Christian Eriksen, who entered as a substitute, added a late fourth.Pochettino could enjoy productivity from all three of his summer signings. Never mind Lo Celso, Tanguy Ndombele was excellent and even Ryan Sessegnon, who came off the bench, supplied the assist for Eriksen.Red Star rued the squandering of two excellent first-half chances but Spurs simply had more quality. They hogged the ball, they led the shot count 17-5 and, at the end, there was the sight of Son and Pochettino offering their thanks to the travelling support.Son’s goal celebrations were subdued. The first was a praying gesture and he revealed that it was his way of showing respect to Gomes. “I didn’t want to celebrate because I just want to respect the situation,” he said. “It’s been a really, really tough few days. I’m really sorry for the accident but I had to focus for the team. I want to wish André Gomes to get well soon.”Spurs had travelled in the belief that Red Star on home turf would be a different proposition to the team that had slumped to a 5-0 defeat in north London two weeks ago. The statistics offered the warning. In 21 previous European home ties, Red Star had lost only two while exactly a year ago they had beaten Liverpool 2-0. Yet after a cagey opening, in which Milan Pavkov blew a gilt-edged one-on-one with Paulo Gazzaniga, shooting too close to the goalkeeper, Spurs asserted themselves.Pochettino had shuffled his pack, starting Juan Foyth at right-back and Eric Dier in central defence, but Lo Celso was the headline news item. The loanee from Real Betis, whom Spurs have the option to buy for £55m next summer, had previously played only 74 minutes for Spurs. He was in action until 6 July at the Copa América with Argentina and did not sign until 8 August – transfer deadline day in England – having missed pre-season entirely.Lo Celso’s time at Spurs has been characterised by fitness struggles and mutterings from Pochettino that he has been some way off the pace. Here, it was possible to see what he will bring to the team. Playing on the right of midfield, he showed off his change of pace and an eagerness to pass the ball with zip and directness.Lo Celso began the move which led to the breakthrough goal, pouncing on Dusan Jovancic to win possession and release Harry Kane, although a good deal would happen before he jabbed his shot past Milan Borjan.Kane’s first touch looked heavy but he got to the ball before Borjan to poke a shot against the foot of a post. When Son’s follow-up attempt was hacked off the line, it appeared that the danger had passed. Yet Ndombele recycled the move, crossing for Kane, who flashed a volley across the face of goal. Son stretched to ert the ball up and against the crossbar and, after a further scramble, Lo Celso took a touch and prodded home.Red Star might have feared it would not be their night when they also hit the frame of the goal twice in the same move on 44 minutes, only this time there would be no finish. Rajiv van La Parra rattled the foot of the near post and, when Davinson Sánchez accidentally looped the rebound towards his own goal, it came back off the crossbar.Red Star’s end product was missing. Witness Pavkov’s decision to pass rather than shoot when well-placed early in the second half – he got it all wrong – and Spurs turned the screw thereafter.There is a swashbuckling quality to Ndombele and he drove hard into the final third before whipping the ball over to Dele Alli, who played in Son with a perfectly weighted assist. Son thrashed the ball past Borjan before he added his second shortly afterwards. It was another nicely worked team effort.Kane got Danny Rose in behind the Red Star defence and the full-back’s low cross invited Son to tap home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4c166d54f0226ac33aac26dcc21a9cea4faeb53/0_275_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=113328d6160372dd9c42e13c6da351ee","title":"faking it could i go from being an introvert to an extrovert in one week ","story":"New research has found that being an extrovert makes you happier. So I spent a week attending social events to see if I could trick myself into being more naturally outgoingI was asked to torture myself for a week for this experiment. Well, not torture, but close enough for me. For a week, this introvert would put social awkwardness to one side and live as an extrovert. I don’t particularly enjoy meeting new people. I decline most party invitations and if I do go, I leave as soon as I can without causing offence. Sometimes I fantasise about doing what Princess Diana used to do when she wanted to lose friends – change her phone number. So the prospect of spending a week saying yes to every social engagement that came my way was about as appealing as a root canal treatment.But evidence shows that conquering your inner introversion can be good for your mental health. In the first study of its kind, researchers at the University of California asked 123 people to act as extroverts for a week. Participants were asked to be talkative, assertive and spontaneous in their daily interactions with other people. The following week, the same group was asked to act like introverts. The findings were remarkable.“It was the biggest effect we’ve ever found in any of our studies,” says Dr Sonja Lyubomirsky, the lead researcher. “When people acted extrovert, they experienced more positive emotions and satisfaction. When they acted introvert, they experienced fewer positive emotions.” She speculates that this is because, at heart, humans are social creatures. “Social relationships are inherently rewarding for us. We have a need to belong and to connect with each other.”But how to do it? If there is one person to ask, it is Jessica Pan. In 2018, Pan spent a year as an extrovert and documented the experience in a memoir, Sorry I’m Late, I Didn’t Want to Come. “You won’t die,” Pan says. “But you are probably going to be exhausted by the end of the week.” (Unlike extroverts, who draw energy from social encounters, introverts find them draining.)She advises me to steer clear of small talk, which is good, because I loathe it. “If you spend the whole week talking about the weather, I think you’ll hate it.” Instead, go deep and be vulnerable. “Share something vulnerable about yourself, even if that seems terrifying. A person will match that normally and you will feel as if you’re making a friend.”Pan gives me a set of rules: no booze because it makes things easier, no taking a friend along for moral support – “That’s cheating!” – and I must spend an hour and a half at each engagement, minimum. Here goes nothing.I start the week by attending an Extinction Rebellion induction meeting. I have toyed with the idea of joining the movement for months, but put it off because none of my friends are members and the thought of going alone frightens me.In a chilly church hall, I take a seat in a circle of stacking chairs. There is a long pause while I steel myself to turn to the person next to me.“Hi,” I say. “I’m Sirin.”I start chatting to Ben, who has just moved into the area. He is a friendly bloke with a deep tan and a placid manner. Remembering Pan’s advice, I offer something vulnerable about myself. “I’ve wanted to come to these meetings for ages, but none of my friends wanted to come with me.” My anxieties tumble out. “Also I eat meat and fly, and I’m worried everyone here would judge me.”Ben looks at me kindly. After the meeting, he waves at me from the church steps. I’ll be back, I think.This evening I am playing dodgeball with strangers and all I can think about is how much I don’t want to do it. I was abysmal at team sports at school, and the thought of balls ricocheting around me feels like an anxiety dream. After checking the maximum velocity of a dodgeball (70mph), I panic and call Jacob, the Headshot United team coordinator, for some last-minute reassurance.“We’re really bad,” Jacob promises. “We’ve lost the last nine games. Besides, you can hide at the back. There will be a few people who wear knee pads and stuff like that – try not to worry about them.”I catch up with Jacob and his teammate, Ed, for a pre-game drink. “Someone joined us last week and said they didn’t have a good time and wouldn’t be coming back,” says Ed. I gulp.Jacob senses my anxiety. “If you really are hating it, you don’t have to keep playing,” he says.We head to a nearby school gym. Playing team sports with strangers was exactly like losing my virginity: not memorably awful, but definitely not good. I cringe every time a ball thuds my way and lack the strength to make my throws clear the other side of the court. Obviously, I get hit on the head. “You took that head shot like an absolute champ,” observes a teammate.While I didn’t enjoy dodgeball – hated it, if I’m honest – I loved meeting everyone. After the game (we lost), I hit the pub with Jacob and his teammate Will. “You’re not the worst newcomer we’ve ever had,” Jacob says.Today I am meeting up with Emma, whom I don’t know. We’re going to a Crossfit class – a famously social workout, where high fives, fist bumps and (God forbid) hugs with sweaty strangers are de rigueur.Emma introduces me to Rich, the owner of Crossfit Shapesmiths in south London. “I’M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU,” Rich bellows at me. “COME HERE FOR A HUG. COME HERE!” We hug. “He’s like that with everyone,” Emma says. “He’s just really happy.”I meet JP, who will be leading the class. The workout flies by. Emma is a sweetheart. “You’re doing great!” she cheers, as I flub my way through some complicated moves involving a kettlebell. “Good pace!”After the class, JP instructs us – orders, really – to high five. Old Sirin would cringe at this enforced bonhomie, but new Sirin is all high fives. I’m just happy I didn’t get hit in the face.“What is a weed?” asks Cathy, the leader of Waltham Forest’s volunteer gardening group, “It’s a plant in the wrong place.”The group meets every Thursday morning to tend the grounds behind the William Morris Gallery in east London. Looking round, I can relate. I have never gardened before and most of the people here are regulars. Being a newbie among outsiders, doing something I have never done before – not my favourite thing.My goodness, they are a friendly bunch. We yank out weeds and fling them into a pile. It is a beautiful morning, crisp and clear. I make friends with Judith, who is retired and lives locally. “It’s difficult, making friends in London,” she says. “It’s not like you can just walk up to people in the street. They’d think you were a nutter.”After a tea break, I’m promoted to planting. I try not to look at the worms that tumble from my spade. “I just fling the worms away,” says Judith conspiratorially. We tuck the plants into the soil together, like children being put to bed. “You’ll come back, won’t you?” says Judith.I’m flagging. Pan warned me I would be tired and she was right. If my life were a night out, right now I would be sitting in the smoking area, begging a friend to fetch my coat. The last thing I want to do is hang out with a stranger.On Bumble BFF, a friendship app, I start chatting to Radhika, 25, a student from Delhi. We meet up later at an audiovisual exhibition about the natural world. It’s not the most successful meeting. Radhika is lovely, but it’s not the sort of place where you can chat and it’s awkward to be walking in silence with someone you have just met. As a result, Radhika and I never get past first base conversationally, which makes our interaction stilted, like kissing with braces. In the gallery, the sounds of the wilderness are compressed into a bright heartbeat of lasers. Radhika says she was homesick last week – it was the Diwali celebration. A few friends had had a gathering, but it wasn’t the same. I feel guilty for co-opting her into my experiment. Moving to a new place on your own is hard.A lot of my anxiety around socialising is linked to the fact that I often feel responsible for making conversation, as I do today. The encounter was wearing, probably because I already felt drained. After the exhibition, I suggest a drink, but Radhika declines. I’m relieved.I wake up with a ball of dread in my stomach that won’t go away . Why? I’m going to a Halloween party tonight, full of people I don’t know, and I’ll be flying solo.As evening approaches, the feeling intensifies. I desperately don’t want to go and find myself tidying drawers and sorting laundry until I can’t put off going any longer.Outside the house, I text Pan for some last-minute support. “ARGH I DON’T WANT TO GO TO THIS PARTY ON MY OWN.” She texts back. “Talk to three people and if they suck, you can leave. Also, ask the host to introduce you to some people.”I take a breath and ring the bell.Ordinarily, the hardest part of going to a party alone is walking in, not knowing anyone. In my case, it was realising once through the door that not only did I not know anyone, they were all in fancy dress. Luckily, the host Dan (not his real name) or, rather, Emperor Caligula – takes me under his wing. He introduces me to Gosia and Ula, sisters from Poland. Pan’s tip to let myself be vulnerable definitely helps: I tell Gosia and Ula about my anxieties and they look after me all evening as carefully as if I were a baby bird.It’s a great party. There is a severed head in the freezer and drinks are served in IV bags – but I’m so tired after the week’s exertions that I only last a few hours before making my excuses. “Your costume was awful,” Dan says, walking me to the door.I am comfortably the youngest person by a few decades on today’s walk, which is organised by the London Strollers. It’s no bother – one of the joys of my week of extroversion has been the opportunity to chat to older people.About 30 of us set off on a three-hour walk around north London. Things do not start off well. Although the woman I had been walking with seems friendly initially, she then makes a number of offenseive comments. The thought of having to spend the morning listening to her fills me with a crushing ennui. I am already so tired. I don’t think I can bear this.Then Elizabeth comes to my rescue. She is very tall and upright, a headscarf knotted under her chin – my knight in a green raincoat.We talk about everything. How she has just got into football and is learning Italian, which will be her sixth language. Her childhood in Finland, and the 40 years she spent as a nurse. (She retired five years ago, at the age of 70.) She tells me about her husband, a communist, who died. And her children, who also died. And why you should only marry someone with the same political views as yours – preferably a communist. “Socialists, they sit on the fence,” Elizabeth shrugs, striding up Primrose Hill.I loved meeting Elizabeth. I could have talked to her all day. I take her number and we make loose plans to go to a protest together.So what did I learn from my week of extroversion? That people are kinder than you think and it is often easier to be truthful with strangers. That you should open yourself up to new experiences because the worst that can happen is getting hit in the face with a dodgeball, and that is not so bad. That we are all of us inidual moving dots, part of the same involuntary palpitating life, crisscrossing as we walk the streets. It’s nice for the dots to collide sometimes, even for a little while. Strangers can come together and share their stories. We all have a story to tell.I’m still an introvert and I don’t see that changing soon. But perhaps you will see me a bit more from now on. Maybe.

And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more – and it was happening more frequently.“I saw a Catholic priest,” said the man. “But he couldn’t help. Can you?”Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do.I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney’s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and ine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes.As a teenager, I’d devoured a book called Positive Magic. An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties.That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break. She picked the card for pregnancy, which we laughed about, because she wanted her tubes tied.A week later she said, “Guess what the doctor told me this morning?”She was pregnant, and I was officially psychic.Deciding to develop my gift, I enrolled in a psychic class, where I learned to say the first thing that popped into my head. “Your first thoughts are the most psychic ones, before your rational mind interferes,” said the teacher.I also learned that all things are connected, and everything is a symbol of something else. Suddenly, I saw signs and omens everywhere.To test my new skills, I volunteered to be a clairvoyant at the spiritualist church. Congregants would place a flower on the table, and the clairvoyants would choose one and “read” it at the microphone. Nervous, the first thing I grabbed was a packet of silver foil. The rose inside had been packed so tightly, its petals were crushed. I didn’t get a single vibe from it, so I just described the symbolism.“You are feeling battered and bruised,” I said.Afterwards, a woman approached and said she was a victim of domestic violence, and what should she do?I was only 19 and had no idea, but my psychic reputation soared. The attention was intoxicating.Then the universe told me I wasn’t cut out for science, by sending me my second-year results. I dropped out to pursue theatre and also signed up for a one-year course at the Sydney Astrology Centre, a cavernous commercial building in a seedy part of town.The course began with the meanings of the zodiac, from Aries to Aquarius. Then the luminaries the sun (what you will become), the moon (what you brought into this life) and planets. After that, how to calculate planetary positions and cast horoscopes.Although astrologers use Nasa data for their calculations, horoscopes aren’t a true map of the heavens. The Babylonians who invented astrology believed the sun rotated round the Earth modern astrologers still use Earth-centred charts, as if Copernicus had never existed. That’s only the start of the scientific problems.The astrological meanings themselves derive from a principle called sympathetic magic, where things that look alike are linked together. Mars looks red, so it rules red things like blood. How do you get blood? You cut, so Mars rules surgery and war.You forecast by combining meanings with planetary movements. Say Saturn, planet of restrictions, is about to transit the First House of self – your life will contract! You’re going to get more responsibilities than usual. Or maybe you’ll be denied the chance to take on more responsibilities. Or maybe a cold, critical person will come into your life. But anyway, it’s a good time to go on a diet.Astrology is one big word association game.I loved it, though I was losing interest in other mystical practices. Partly I didn’t have time, because I was now immersed in theatre while working as a temp typist at St Vincent’s, a Catholic hospital. But as I bounced from one department to another, my views changed. I’d understood organised religion to be something between an embarrassment and an evil. Yet as Aids did its dreadful work – this was the 1990s – I watched nuns offer compassionate care to the dying. Christian volunteers checked on derelict men with vomit down their clothes. I became uncomfortably aware that New Agers do not build hospitals or feed alcoholics – they buy self-actualisation at the cash register.Finally, I was accepted into a music degree and my days filled with classes, my nights with rehearsals. This caused a cash crisis, because I could only do office work during academic holidays. When I saw the ad for a fortune teller, I pounced.My credentials impressed the man on the counter (“My name is Ron,” he said. “My spirit guide is Blue Star. He’s on the intergalactic committee”) and I was hired.We charged A$50 an hour, a significant sum at the time, and I wanted to offer value. No fishing for clues from me – I printed a horoscope or laid the cards and started interpreting immediately, intending to dazzle the customer with my insights.Half the time, though, I couldn’t get a word in. It turned out what most people want is the chance to unload for an hour. The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change. I heard these stories so often I could often guess what the problem was the moment someone walked in. Heartbroken young men, for example, talk about it to psychics, because it’s less risky than telling their friends. Sometimes I’d mischievously say, “Let her go. She’s not worth it,” as soon as one arrived. Once I heard, “Oh my God, oh my GOD!” as an amazed guy fell backwards down the stairs.I also learned that intelligence and education do not protect against superstition. Many customers were stockbrokers, advertising executives or politicians, dealing with issues whose outcomes couldn’t be controlled. It’s uncertainty that drives people into woo, not stupidity, so I’m not surprised millennials are into astrology. They grew up with Harry Potter and graduated into a precarious economy, making them the ideal customers.What broke the spell for me was, oddly, people swearing by my gift. Some repeat customers claimed I’d made very specific predictions, of a kind I never made. It dawned on me that my readings were a co-creation – I would weave a story and, later, the customer’s memory would add new elements. I got to test this theory after a friend raved about a reading she’d had, full of astonishingly accurate predictions. She had a tape of the session, so I asked her to play it.The clairvoyant had said none of the things my friend claimed. Not a single one. My friend’s imagination had done all the work.Yet sometimes I could be uncannily accurate – wasn’t that proof I was psychic? One Sunday, I went straight from work to a party, before I’d had time to shuck off my psychic persona. A student there mentioned she wasn’t sure what to specialize in – photography, graphic design or maybe industrial design?“Do photography,” I said.She looked at me, wide-eyed. “How did you know?” she said, explaining photography was her real love, but her parents didn’t approve.I couldn’t say, “because my third eye is open”, so I reflected for a moment. Then it hit me. “You sounded happier when you said ‘photography’,” I said. My psychic teacher was right – the signals we pick up before conscious awareness kicks in can be accurate and valuable.Well, maybe I wasn’t psychic, but it didn’t matter. It was just entertainment, after all, until the cursed man came in. The one who’d seen the Catholic priest.“Get to a doctor,” I told him. “Now.”That very week, I’d typed letters for a neurologist who specialized in brain diseases. Some of those letters had documented strikingly similar symptoms to this man.“Are you saying I’m crazy?” he said, his hands balled.“No,” I reassured him. “But Catholic priests know what they’re doing. If he couldn’t help, this isn’t a curse.”That made the man angrier.“You’re a fraud!” he shouted, and stormed downstairs to demand his money back.The encounter shook me, badly. Shortly afterwards, I packed my astrology books and Tarot cards away for good.I can still make the odd forecast, though. Here’s one: the venture capital pouring into astrology apps will create a fortune telling system that works, because humans are predictable. As people follow the advice, the apps’ predictive powers will increase, creating an ever-tighter electronic leash. But they’ll be hugely popular – because if you sprinkle magic on top, you can sell people anything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af628bf8287019b88d9c70c845ccf8084b89e195/437_572_2670_1602/master/2670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6ca4025652783009e5908c8516ae08","title":"have you seen any uk political adverts without disclosures on social media general election","story":"During the general election campaign we would like to hear about the political adverts you have seen on social media From 22 November political adverts will be banned on Twitter, however, other social media platforms such as Facebook will still allow them on their sites.Ahead of the UK general election we would like you to help us collect examples of political adverts running on social media which do not mention who has sponsored them.Political adverts on Facebook should clearly state who has paid for them in their posts.However, commercial adverts do not say who they are “paid for by” but only show that they are sponsored.If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we would like to hear from you.If you see an advert that does not say “paid for by” screenshot it.

I’ve identified a model that I’d like, but I’m puzzled by the infrastructure I’ll need. As far as I can tell, it’d be cheapest to charge the car overnight, using a suitable tariff like Economy 7. But I’m reluctant to commit to installing a charger until I’ve worked out what to do next. Should I check with my energy supplier first to see if it has a suitable tariff, or go ahead and get the charger installed in the hope that I can find a suitable tariff afterwards. Or should I just buy the car and sort out charging issues later? SP, LondonFor pioneers like you, there’s the issue of rapidly evolving battery and charging technologies and the dearth of public charging points. According to David Lewis, founder of the advice website electriccarhome, the cost of charging depends on where, when and how often, you charge. Charging at home overnight on an off-peak tariff would cost 5p per kWh rising to 30p at a motorway service station. At work, or at a hotel, it could be free if you have an obliging employer or all-in deal.A number of energy companies offer cheap night-time rates for electric car owners, depending on where you live.Find the provider first, preferably an eco-friendly one since that’s the whole point, and get a free smart meter installed before you bring the car home. If you have off-street parking, it’s safer and faster to get a dedicated charging point installed and you get a £500 government grant towards the cost.Lewis advises asking your electricity supplier to confirm that the type of charging point you have in mind is “smart” enough to charge automatically during the off-peak charging window. Once you’re up and running that 5p off-peak tariff could buy you 10,000 miles for around £132 a year.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Or did it? By  Emmanuel CarrèreToward the end of the 1960s, Luke Rhinehart worked as a psychoanalyst in New York and was bored stiff. He lived in a pretty apartment with a nice view. He practised yoga, read books on Zen, dreamed vaguely of joining a commune but did not dare. As a therapist, he was resolutely nondirective. If a patient who still had not lost his virginity was plagued by sadistic impulses and said on Rhinehart’s couch that he would like to rape and kill a little girl, his professional ethics obliged him to repeat with a calm voice: “You’d like to rape and kill a little girl?” No judgment. But what he wanted to say was: “Well, go ahead, then! If what really turns you on is raping and killing a little girl, then stop boring me with this fantasy. Do it!”He checked himself before coming out with such monstrosities, but they obsessed him more and more. His own fantasies were nothing extreme – not enough to get him sent to prison – but like everyone else, he stopped himself going through with them. What Luke would have liked, for example, was to sleep with Arlene, the wife of his colleague Jake Ecstein, who lived across the landing. But as a faithful husband, he let the idea simmer away in the back of his mind.So life plods on, calm and dreary, until one night after a dinner party, when he has had a little too much to drink. Rhinehart sees a dice lying on the carpet, a banal playing dice, and gets the idea of throwing it and acting on its instructions. He says to himself: “If it lands on a number from two to six, I’ll do what I would have done anyway: bring the dirty glasses back to the kitchen, brush my teeth, take a double aspirin, go to bed beside my sleeping wife, and maybe masturbate discreetly thinking of Arlene. But if I roll a one, I’ll do what I really want to do: I know Arlene’s at home alone tonight, so I’ll go across the hall, knock on her door and sleep with her.”The dice lands on one. Rhinehart hesitates, feeling vaguely that he is standing on a threshold: if he crosses it, his life could change. But it is not his decision, it is the dice’s, so he obeys. Arlene opens the door in a negligee she is surprised but not put out. When Rhinehart comes back home two extremely pleasant hours later, he realises that he has changed. He did something he wouldn’t normally do.From now on, he always consults the dice. Since it has six sides, he gives it six options. The first is to do what he has always done. The five others depart more or less distinctly from this routine. Once it has been subjected to the dice, even the most anodyne choice – that of a film, a restaurant – opens a vast array of possibilities for putting your routine behind you.His choices soon become more audacious. Going somewhere he would never go, getting to know people he would otherwise never meet. He pushes his patients to leave their families and jobs, to change their political and sexual orientations. His reputation suffers, but Rhinehart does not care. What he likes, now, is doing the exact opposite of what he would normally do: putting salt in his coffee, jogging in a tuxedo, going to work in shorts, pissing in the flowerpots, walking backward, sleeping under his bed. His wife finds him strange, but he says it is a psychological experiment, and she lets herself be lulled into believing it. Until the day he gets the idea of initiating his children.One weekend when their mother is not there, Rhinehart gets his little boy and girl to play this apparently innocent game: you write six things you would like to do on a piece of paper, and the dice chooses one of them. It all goes well at the start: they eat ice cream, go to the zoo. Then his son becomes bolder and says that one thing he would like to do is go beat up a boy who bugs him at school. “OK, write it down,” Rhinehart says, and that is what the dice rolls. The boy thinks his father won’t make him go through with it, but his dad says: “Go ahead.” The boy goes to his friend’s place, hits him several times, and comes back to the house with his eyes shining and asks: “Where are the dice, Dad?”That makes Rhinehart stop and think: if his son so naturally adopts this way of being, it is because he is not yet completely warped by the absurd notion that it is good for children to develop a coherent character. What if they were brought up differently, giving pride of place to contradiction, multiplicity and relentless change? Luke seriously thinks of freeing his son from the dismal tyranny of the ego and making him the first man entirely subject to chance. Then his wife returns and discovers what has been going on. Not finding it funny in the least, she leaves Rhinehart and takes the children with her.Next, it is his profession that Rhinehart abandons, after disgracing himself (on the dice’s instructions) at an evening with the cream of New York psychoanalysts. With no family, work or personal ties, he is free to move from transgression to transgression. Eventually, the day comes when the dice pushes him to do things that he had not only never dared to do, but didn’t want to do, because they ran counter to his tastes, his desires, his whole personality. But that’s just it: the personality – the miserable, petty personality – is the enemy to be done away with, the conditioning that you have to free yourself from.Sooner or later, he could not avoid writing “murder” on his list of options. When the dice orders him to do it, Rhinehart is forced to draw up a list of six potential victims, in which he courageously includes his two children. Luckily for him, he is spared that particular ordeal: the dice simply demands that he kill one of his former patients.If you believe his autobiography, he went through with it, although certain commentators doubt it. What does seem certain is that having ruined his career, his family life and his reputation, Rhinehart was ready to become a prophet, and that is what he did. In these years when the most paradoxical therapies flourished from one side of the US to the other, a guru with a dice had every chance of attracting followers. So he establishes the Centers for Experiments in Totally Random Environments, where you enrol of your own free will but undertake not to leave until the experiment is over. In time, students are expected to commit to roleplays of varying durations: you list six personality types and for 10 minutes, an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year, adopt the one that the dice decides.Some of the followers of dice therapy went insane. Others died or ended up in prison. Some, it seems, reached a state of nirvana. During their short existence, Rhinehart’s centres became as scandalous as Timothy Leary’s communities: a school of chaos posing as serious a threat to civilisation as communism or the satanism of Charles Manson, as the conservative newspapers had it. The end of the adventure is shrouded in obscurity. It is said that Rhinehart was arrested by the FBI, that he spent 20 years in a psychiatric hospital. Or that he died. Or that he never existed at all.Everything I have just told comes from a book, The Dice Man, published in the US in 1971 and translated into French the following year. I was 16 when I discovered it, as a terribly timid adolescent with long hair, an afghan jacket and little round glasses. For a while, I walked around with a dice in my pocket, counting on it to give me the self-confidence I lacked with girls. (Not that it worked too well.) The Dice Man is the kind of book that not only pleases readers but also gives them a set of rules for life: a manual for subversion.It was not clear whether the book was fiction or autobiography, but its author, Luke Rhinehart, had the same name as his hero and, like him, he was a psychiatrist. According to the back cover, he lived in Majorca – seemingly the ideal refuge for a prophet at the end of his tether, who has just managed to escape from his shipwrecked community of maniacs. The years passed, The Dice Man remained the object of a minor but persistent cult, and each time I met someone who had read it (almost always a pothead, and often a follower of the I Ching), the same questions came up: what was true in the book? Who was Luke Rhinehart? What had become of him?After The Dice Man came up in conversation a little while back, I started to wonder once again what had become of Luke Rhinehart. In an hour online, of course, I learned more about Rhinehart than I had in 30 years of idle conjecture.His real name is George Cockcroft, and though no longer young, he is alive. He has written other books, but none as successful as The Dice Man, which almost 50 years after it came out is still a cult classic. Dozens of sites are dedicated to it, and just as many legends circulate about it. Ten times it was almost adapted for the cinema, but mysteriously the project never came about. Communities of followers of the dice still exist all over the world. As for the mythical author, he lives as a recluse on a remote farm in upstate New York. One particular photo of him makes the rounds: it shows a sarcastic, gaunt face under a stetson. I imagine Luke Rhinehart as something like Carlos Castaneda, William Burroughs and Thomas Pynchon rolled into one: an icon of the most radical subversion, transformed into an invisible man. I decide that I must meet him.One detail should have warned me that my initial ideas were not quite right: my invisible man has his own website, through which I was able to contact him. He answered my message in less than an hour, with surprising good grace for a recluse. I wanted to come from France to interview him? What a good idea! When I filled him in on the reason for my visit, he told me that he hoped he was not going to disappoint me: on my search for Luke Rhinehart I was going to meet George Cockcroft, and George Cockcroft, in his own words, was an old fart. I took this warning as false modesty.For the past couple of weeks, I have been in contact with some followers of the dice on the internet, and on my way through New York I invite one to dinner. Ron is 30, introduces himself as a conceptual artist and urban pirate, and heads a community of dice people who meet every month for what, under all the new-age jargon, seems to be good old group sex, where the dice above all decides who will be on top, who on the bottom and so on. No such thing is planned for the days when I will be there, I learn a little to my regret, but the urban pirate appears impressed by my boldness: knocking on Luke Rhinehart’s door! Pulling on the tiger’s whiskers! That’s really venturing into the dark side of the Force. I answer that to judge by the author’s messages, he seems like a nice old guy. Ron looks at me pensively, with a touch of pity: “A nice old guy … Sure, why not? Maybe the dice ordered him to play that role for you. But don’t forget that a dice has six sides. He’s showing you one, you don’t know what’s behind the other five, or when he’ll decide to reveal them … ”The man waiting for me when I arrive in Hudson in upstate New York is wearing the same Stetson as he is in that photograph. He has the same jagged features, the same faded blue eyes and the same slightly sardonic smile. He is tall and has a bit of a slouch you could even find him sinister, but when I hold out my hand, he gives me a big hug, kisses me on both cheeks as if I were his son and introduces me to his wife, Ann, who is just as warm and welcoming as he is.We all pile into their old station wagon, and as we drive past the orchards and through the woods, I realise that this landscape reminds me of one of my favourite novels: Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton. My hosts are enchanted: it is one of their favourites as well, and George has often taught it to his students.To his students? He is not a psychiatrist, or a psychoanalyst?“Psychiatrist? Psychoanalyst?” George repeats, as surprised as if I had said cosmonaut. No, he was never a psychiatrist, he has been a college English teacher all his life.Really? But on the cover of his book …George shrugs as if to say, editors, journalists, you know, there is almost nothing they won’t write.From Hudson we drive for about an hour he handles the wheel with an abruptness that contrasts with his good humour and makes his wife laugh. It is moving to see how the two love each other, and when Ann tells me in passing that they have been married for 50 years, I am not surprised.They live in an old farmhouse with a yard that slopes down to a duck pond. They have three grown boys, two of whom live nearby. One is a carpenter and the other is a housepainter the third still lives at home. He is schizophrenic, Ann tells me matter-of-factly he is doing fine at the moment, but I shouldn’t worry if I hear him speaking a bit loudly in his room, which is right beside the guest room where I will be staying. (I invited myself for the weekend, but I get the feeling that if I wanted to settle in for a week or a month, it wouldn’t be a problem.)Ann serves us tea, and George and I take our mugs out on to the terrace for the interview. He has swapped his Stetson for a baseball cap, and I ask him to tell me about his life. He starts from the beginning.He was born in 1932 in Albany, just a few miles from where he now lives and where, in all likelihood, he will die. Semi-rural middle-class, hit hard by the Depression, in spite of which he looks back on a more or less happy childhood and youth. Good at maths, a bit of an egghead and not adventurous in the least, he reached 20 without having felt the slightest creative urge. At college he began studying psychology, but found it tedious and instead decided it was better to read novels.While working night shifts as an intern in a hospital on Long Island, he devoured Mark Twain, Herman Melville and the great 19th-century Russian writers. He started working on a novel that took place in a psychiatric hospital. The hero is a young man who has been interned because he thinks he is Jesus, and among the hospital staff is a doctor named Luke Rhinehart, who practises dice therapy. The dice was a quirk the young George picked up in college. He and his friends used it on Saturdays to decide what they were going to do that night. Sometimes, they dared each other to do stuff: hop around the block on one leg, ring a neighbour’s doorbell, nothing too mischievous. When I ask, hopefully, whether he pushed these experiences further as an adult, he shrugs his shoulders and smiles apologetically because he can tell that I would like something a little spicier.“No,” he admits. “All I asked the dice was, for example, if I’d had enough of working: do I stay at my desk for another hour? Or two hours? Or do I go for a walk right away?”“What are you talking about?” says Ann, who has come on to the terrace to offer us some blueberry crumble. “Don’t you remember at least one important decision that the dice made you take?”He laughs, so does she, and he tells me that he had noticed an attractive nurse at the hospital, but was shy and didn’t dare talk to her. The dice made him do it: he drove her home, took her to church, but the church was closed, so he invited her to play tennis. Of course, the attractive nurse was Ann.Ten years later they had three little boys, and George, who had become an English teacher, applied for a job at the American school in Mallorca. This expatriation is the big adventure of their lives. Although Mallorca in the 1960s was associated with psychedelia and wild living, George didn’t take drugs, was faithful to his wife, and mostly just hung around with other teachers like himself. Still, he didn’t completely escape the zeitgeist. He started to read books on psychoanalysis, antipsychiatry, oriental mysticism, Zen – all aspects of 1960s counterculture, whose grand idea was that we are conditioned, and that we must free ourselves from this conditioning. Influenced by this reading, he suddenly became aware of the revolutionary potential of something he had thought of as no more than a simple game, and had more or less given up since his adolescence. Although he had also long ago given up on the idea of writing books, he got fired up about what would become The Dice Man. He spent four years writing it, supported faithfully by his wife.Much to their surprise, an editor paid good money for the book, and the rights were sold to Paramount. Then The Dice Man started to live its erratic, unpredictable life: success in Europe but not in the US, regular new editions and, eventually, cult status. There were disappointments: for one obscure reason or another the film was never made, and none of his other books had the same success. But the rights from The Dice Man allowed them to buy this beautiful house, and to age with dignity – George writing, Ann painting, both of them caring for their son with schizophrenia.The day I visited was Mother’s Day, and the two other boys came over to celebrate it with their parents. They are good American kids: Budweiser drinkers, trout fishers, wearers of checkered shirts. Later, their brother came out of his room for a short while. All three told Ann she was “a terrific mom”. After dinner, we finished the evening at the house of one of their sons, also in the middle of the countryside. He has an outdoor jacuzzi, in which George and I continued to drink while looking up at the stars, with the result that I don’t quite remember how I made it back to my room.It is strange how much you can project on to a photograph. The one of Luke Rhinehart made me imagine a whole novel: a dangerous, sulphurous life filled with excesses, transgressions and ruptures. Bordellos in Mexico, communities of madmen in the Nevada desert, delirious, mind-expanding experiences. And this face, the same face with strong bones and eyes of steel, is in fact that of an adorable old man who is approaching the end of a sweet, comfortable life with his adorable wife, a man whose only departure from the norm was to have written this alarming book, and who in his old age must softly, gently explain to people who come to see him that you must not confuse it with him, and that he is simply a novelist.Really? But what did I know about the reality? I remembered the warning of Ron, the urban pirate. What you see, the adorable old man, is just one side of the dice. It is the side that the dice ordered him to show you, but at least five others are in reserve.At breakfast I could see that George was worried he had disappointed me. So he took me kayaking on a lake, and as our kayaks skimmed slowly over the calm water, he told me the stories of some of his disciples. What he was content merely to imagine, others did for real. Take the tycoon Richard Branson. He used to say that all of his choices in business and in life had been taken thanks to the dice, influenced by Luke Rhinehart.Then there was the British gonzo journalist Ben Marshall who, in the 1990s, took on an assignment in which he would follow Rhinehart’s example for three months: let all of your decisions be taken by the dice and write about what happens. The journalist took the assignment seriously enough, it seems, to trash his love life and his professional life, and to disappear without a trace for several months. “A funny guy, that Ben,” George tells me. “You can see him in Diceworld, a documentary made by an English TV channel in 1999.”I had never heard of this documentary and ask if George has a copy we can watch. All of a sudden he looks embarrassed. He says it is not great, and he is not sure he even has it. But I insist, and in no time we are sitting on the living room couch in front of the big TV and the film starts. It is true, it is not great. But it does show Marshall, who volunteered to gamble his life on the dice and who explains convincingly how he stopped before he went mad, because the dice can drive you mad.And lo and behold, whom do we see next? His inspiration, our friend George – or rather, our friend Luke, as he was 15 years ago: the Stetson, the gaunt face, the steely eyes, handsome, but not at all like the doting grandfather I know. In a low, insinuating, hypnotic voice, he says into the camera: “You lead a dull life, a life of slavery, a life that doesn’t satisfy you, but there’s a way to get out of it. This way is the dice. Let yourself go, submit yourself to it, and you’ll see, your life will change, you’ll become someone you can’t even imagine.”Saying this, he looks like a televangelist, the head of a sect filmed just before his followers commit mass suicide. He is frightening. I turn to look at the person beside me on the couch, the nice pensioner in slippers holding his mug of herbal tea. He gives me an embarrassed, apologetic smile and says that the Luke in this film is not him. He, George, wasn’t so keen on it, but the director insisted.Ann, who can hear us from the kitchen, laughs gaily. “You’re watching the film where you play the spook?”He laughs, too, beside me on the couch. Nevertheless, when I see him on the screen, I find him awfully convincing.I met other followers of the dice over the internet: one in Salt Lake City, one in Munich, one in Madrid. All men. In Madrid, Oscar Cuadrado, who came to meet me at the airport, is young, a bit pudgy, and nice. On the way to his place in his 4×4, he made what was by now a familiar joke: “I may look nice, but you never know what the dice’s got in store for tonight: maybe I’m a serial killer and you’ll find yourself chained to my basement wall.”He lives in a stylish house in the suburbs, together with his wife and daughter, and without further ado we sat at a lawn table and consulted the dice: do we have a drink right away, or do we wait until we have done the interview? Three sides for a drink, three against: we could just as well have tossed a coin. The answer: right away. Now, do we drink beer, table wine or the bottle that Cuadrado’s saving for his daughter’s 18th birthday? Two sides for the beer, three for the table wine, and just one for the special bottle, because although he would open it willingly – you don’t refuse the dice – still … Finally, it is over a glass of table wine that he explains to me how he uses the dice.Like everyone, Cuadrado has heard of people who have ruined their lives by setting extreme conditions such as going halfway around the world and never coming back, having sex with animals or stabbing someone at random in a crowded train station in India. Stories like that circulate on all sites dedicated to the dice – including the one he has been managing for the past 10 years – but they don’t interest him. He recommends using it in a way that makes life more fun and surprising.He has three rules. The first is to always obey. But obeying the dice is ultimately obeying yourself, since you set your options. Hence the second rule, concerning the decisive moment when you list the six possibilities. You have to examine yourself and try to find out what you want. It is a spiritual exercise, aimed both at getting to know yourself and getting a better grasp of the infinite possibilities that reality offers. The options you select have to be pleasant, but at least one – the third – has to be something you would not normally do. It has to make you overcome resistance and break with habit. When you throw the dice, your desire has to be tinged with fear.Ever since he discovered the Spanish translation of The Dice Man when he was 17, this sort of small challenge has been second nature to Cuadrado. Like his father, he is a tax lawyer, but thanks to the dice he has also become a wine importer, a webmaster, a Go teacher, a fan of Iceland and the publisher of the Mauritian poet Malcolm de Chazal. How’s that? Well, first he thought it would be good to get to know a foreign country. Six continents, six options. The dice fell on Europe, then, narrowing the choices, on Iceland. Fine. Now, how should he visit it: on foot, by car, hitchhiking, by boat, by bike or on a skateboard? It landed on bike. The only problem: he had never ridden one before. So he learned, toured Iceland by bike, and even went back with the young woman who would become his wife. On this trip the dice got him to make the proposal, which was accepted.For their honeymoon, the young couple travelled to Mauritius – a present from his parents-in-law, not the dice. But once there, Cuadrado made up for it. He looked around for something to read, an author with something to do with Mauritius. The dice chose the poet Malcolm de Chazal. Bingo: he fell completely in love with De Chazal, a creole surrealist whom the artist André Breton was crazy about. Seeing that De Chazal had not been translated into Spanish, when Cuadrado got back from his honeymoon he founded a publishing company to change that. He knew nothing about publishing, no more than he had known about bike riding. But when he pulls the books from his shelf, I can understand why he is proud: they are magnificent. He sums up: “It’s through Luke that I discovered Malcolm, and now it’s thanks to him that I’ve met you. Funny, isn’t it?”It is our pleasure to inform you that Luke Rhinehart is dead.Luke didn’t fear death, although he confessed to being a bit nervous. Death to him was just another one of life’s unknowns, like travelling to a new land, starting a new book, trusting a new friend. Luke liked to laugh at death, but then again he liked to laugh at everything. He felt confident that death wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. He promised to report back as soon as he could and let us know what he had found. He was confident we would all get a good chuckle out of it. However, at this point we still haven’t heard word.Some of you have asked about Luke’s last days. They were no different from days from any week over the last several decades. People who came to see him on the basis of his books were sometimes discouraged to discover how attached he was to his habits. Even when he threw the dice, it was always to do more or less the same things.“It’s not rolling along in the same old patterns that is bad in itself,” he said, “but rather if you’re enjoying the rolling. If you’re comfortable in the selves you’re rolling along with, then roll on. Most people aren’t. They don’t like who they are. It’s with them in mind that I wrote all those things about the dice. But I’m fine as I am.”Luke’s wife, Ann, was with him to the end.When I received this email, I was surprised, then sad, then moved. Since I had their number, I called Ann to express my condolences. When she picked up the phone, she was as cordial as ever, but she sounded a bit hurried and said she would pass me on to George. I stuttered something about the email I had just received, and she answered like someone who was used to this sort of little misunderstanding: “Oh, the email! Of course … But don’t worry: it’s not George who died, it’s Luke.”When he got on the line, George confirmed: “Yeah, I was getting a little tired of Luke. I’m getting older, you know. I still love life: seeing what the weather’s like when I look out the window in the morning, doing the gardening, making love, going kayaking, but I am less interested in my career, and my career was basically Luke. I wrote that letter for Ann to send it to my correspondents when I died. I kept it in a file for two years, and one day I decided to send it.”I asked him two more questions. The first: before sending this email, did he throw the dice?“Oh, no, that didn’t even occur to me,” said George. “The dice can be useful when you don’t know what you want. But when you know, what use is it?”Second question: how did his correspondents take the news?He gave his mischievous little laugh. “Well, a few thought it was in bad taste. Aside from them, some thought: ‘That’s George!’ And others: ‘That’s Luke!’“And you, what do you think?”This is an abridged version of “In Search of the Dice Man”, an essay from a new collection 97,196 Words by Emmanuel Carrère, published by Bodley Head on 14 November and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dc296d8498f7b83abab9bdafc30fb59e52e5544/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca473551efac5b3b0ad41f4916712a50","title":"how a guardian story led to a landmark case against big tobacco","story":"In June 2018 Sarah Boseley wrote about child labour in the tobacco fields of Malawi.

The case, potentially one of the biggest that human rights lawyers have ever brought, could transform the lives of children in poor countries who are forced to work to survive not only in tobacco but also in other industries such as the garment trade. Sarah Boseley, who wrote the article that drew Leigh Day’s attention to the problem, discusses her reporting with Rachel Humphreys, while lawyer Martyn Day explains how they plan to seek compensation.

The alliance is intended to give a free run to one pro-remain party in each constituency.The agreement, which does not include Labour, covers 49 seats in England and 11 in Wales. It was made under the banner of a cross-party group called Unite to Remain, which has spent several months trying to broker the plan.A so-called progressive alliance plan, also including Labour, was attempted before the 2017 election but arrangements were only made for a handful of seats, in part because of the difficulty of getting local parties to agree.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.The template for the Unite to Remain idea was the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection in August, where the decision of Plaid Cymru and the Greens to stand aside helped the Liberal Democrats overturn a Conservative majority of 8,000 to take the seat.Heidi Allen, the Conservative-turned-Lib-Dem MP, who is standing down in December’s election, was involved in organising the Brecon and Radnorshire pact and subsequently co-launched Unite to Remain.Allen said the level of cross-party working was “unprecedented in modern British political history”.She said: “With a single remain candidate in 60 seats we will return a greater number of remain MPs to parliament. This is our opportunity to tip the balance of power away from the two largest parties and into a progressive remain alliance.”Allen had previously said she hoped to create deals in 70 seats, and to avoid standing against some strongly pro-remain Labour MPs.Beyond giving the split of the seats between England and Wales, the group has not provided details of which seats will be involved, although they are billed as stretching from Cornwall to Yorkshire, and from Sussex to north Wales.The majority of candidates given a free run will be Lib Dems given that the party had 20 MPs when parliament was dissolved this week, against four for Plaid Cymru and one for the Greens.Peter Dunphy, the former Lib Dem treasurer who is a director of Unite to Remain, said Brecon and Radnorshire had been a successful test-case of the approach. “People want to back a winner, people want to back a contender,” he said.He conceded that in some cases the remain alliance would be fielding candidates against sitting Labour MPs, but said the group’s main aim was to reduce the number of Brexit-backing MPs in parliament, most of whom were Conservatives. “What we have sought to do is focus on the bigger picture,” he said.Other directors of Unite to remain include Jim Knight, a former Labour MP who is now a peer, and Jessica Simor, a prominent remain-supporting QC.Such alliances have proved problematic in the past because of the perceived unwillingness of parties, especially Labour, to give ground. The Greens expressed scepticism about taking part in a similar process again.However, a general election dominated by Brexit has focused minds, with some local arrangements already in place. Tthe Lib Dems in Beaconsfield have already announced they will not stand a candidate against the former Tory MP Dominic Grieve, who is standing as an independent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7033845bc9913a0054aa4eaabdce25a1eebb04c1/0_336_5128_3076/master/5128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c7d8672ad4639d6742a55f67ed775d9","title":"young voters tell us your views about the general election","story":"We want to hear from people aged 18-24 about whether they will be voting and, if so, who forAfter years of political turmoil in which Brexit has dominated the agenda, some voters will get the first chance to have their say on the future of the country on December 12.While some MPs worry that this poll will fall at an awkward time for students, when many have travelled home for Christmas, almost a third of the 316,264 voter registration applications submitted within two days of its announcement were under 25.We want to hear from first-time and young voters ahead of the general election.We are interested in hearing from people aged 18-24 about their feelings towards this election.Have you registered to vote?

While its long forearms, curved fingers and powerful, grasping thumbs were hallmarks of life spent dangling from branches, the hips, knees and feet were more human-like and better suited to walking upright, the scientists said.“It was astonishing for us to realise during the process of research how similar certain bones were to humans, as opposed to great apes,” said Madelaine Böhme, who led the study at the University of Tübingen. The fossils, which include remains from two females, a male and a juvenile, were excavated between 2015 and 2018.According to Böhme, the findings suggest that our upright posture can be traced to a common ancestor of humans and great apes that lived in Europe rather than Africa. When D guggenmosi was alive, Bavaria was far hotter than it is today, and streams bordered by gallery forests meandered through the region.The clay pit haul of fossils included teeth, pieces of jaw and spine, and a big toe that would have been handy for grasping tree branches. Arguably the most important fossils were a forearm and shin bone, which informed the scientists’ speculation about how the ape moved around.The most complete skeleton, with 21 bones, was thought to belong to a male that stood a metre high and weighed about 30kg. He had a broad chest and the curved, S-shaped spine seen in humans.Measurements of the teeth placed the ape in an extinct group called the dryopithecins, which lived in Europe in the middle to late Miocene, an epoch that lasted from about 23m years ago to five million years ago. Some researchers believe dryopithecins were the ancestors of the ancient African apes who ultimately gave rise to great apes more generally, including the gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans.Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists make the case for danuvius employing what they call “extended limb clambering” to get around. Rather than swinging from branches or walking cautiously on branches, extended limb clambering uses both arms and legs equally. “The emerging picture of its locomotion is different from any known living creature,” said Böhme.Tracy Kivell, at the University of Kent, said the fossils were impressive. In an accompanying article, she wrote: “Together, the mosaic features of D guggenmosi arguably provide the best model yet of what a common ancestor of humans and African apes might have looked like. It offers something for everyone: the forelimbs suited to life in the trees that all living apes, including humans, still have, and lower limbs suited to extended postures like those used by orangutans during bipedalism in the trees.”“Danuvius shows skeletal adaptations to a form of bipedalism that is previously unknown and shows that bipedalism evolved much earlier than we previously thought,” Kivell said. “Danuvius is not a fossil hominin, but it does help inform how humans may have evolved.”Some of the most compelling evidence for upright walking in human ancestors comes from Ardipithecus ramidus, a female skeleton dating back 4.4m years that was found in Ethiopia. Ardi, who stood about a metre tall, may not have been the most accomplished of walkers, but much of her skeleton shows adaptations to walking on two feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d87b31d24a6ee8e116d1cc8ef3794c547c5f832/0_292_4675_2805/master/4675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e49697afa90ee50450b7a9d0ed5de93","title":"uk work absence due to sickness halved in past two decades","story":"The rate of absence from work due to sickness in people in the UK with no long-term health problems has halved in the past two decades, official figures reveal.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said minor illnesses were the most common cause of absences when all groups of people were taken into account in 2018, accounting for more than a quarter of the more than 141m days missed.The total number of days missed last year because of sickness or injury was equivalent to 4.4 per worker, the ONS said. The previous year saw the lowest figure since the ONS started collecting the figures in 1997.Despite the slight year-on-year rise in 2018, the total number of days lost has remained “relatively flat” since 2010.The ONS noted a rate that was consistently slightly higher among public sector workers but said the figures must be seen in the context of the likelihood of worse sick pay provisions in the private sector.Matt Weston, the managing director of the recruitment firm Robert Half, said the figures provided a “key insight into the wellbeing of the UK workforce and the potential for presenteeism instead of productivity and engagement at work”.He added: “Our recent research revealed that more than one in 10 UK employees are unhappy at work, with many finding their job stressful and reporting dissatisfaction with their work-life balance.

But the ruling body believes some action will be justified to retain public confidence in syndication, which is expected to be a growth area in the sport.“Getting involved in a syndicate is an affordable and fun way to enjoy racehorse ownership,” said a BHA spokesman. “Anybody that runs a syndicate must be registered with the BHA and they are also required to confirm their compliance with a code of conduct, which was introduced in 2017. Complaints are very rare and are usually quickly resolved.“However, as syndication continues to grow, we plan to look at how this area is regulated. It is critical that the public retain trust in syndicates and have confidence that they are going to be well run. There could be various ways to achieve this, with one option being to enhance the level of assessment of prospective managers’ capability to run a syndicate, as part of the application process.”There is already significant scrutiny in place for those who intend to manage syndicates, as they are required by the BHA to register as an owner in their own right, which brings with it ID and credit checks. The regulator’s licensing and integrity teams would review any such application, examining the person’s financial soundness and any unspent criminal or civil proceedings against them.Horses owned by the Supreme Horse Racing Club, including the top‑class Kemboy, are unable to race as the regulator in Ireland seeks answers to questions about its management that have been raised by club members. The story has provided an incidental testament to the BHA’s rigour, as it emerged that those behind Supreme gave up on setting it up in England because “the BHA were making it hard for us”.Ian Robinson, who runs syndicates under the Imperial Racing banner, believes there is scope for the ruling body to do more. “The BHA should have a registration system,” he said.“They should be saying to me, demonstrate to us that you run these partnerships correctly and we will give you our official seal of approval. They’ll argue they do a fit and proper person test. But that only goes to the iniduals. It doesn’t give anyone a guarantee that this is going to be administered in a straightforward, transparent way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb2ab0f7008aef6ccbdb43590bc5fcdff103c173/91_149_4579_2747/master/4579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=815973be9fed49c157c6d2fce6a9d93d","title":"jonny bairstow chris jordan england new zealand t20","story":"It was in Napier, the art deco-styled coastal city on the North Island playing host to Friday evening’s fourth T20 between New Zealand and England, that Alan Mullally once left a dead shark in Mike Atherton’s bed as a prank.On his first tour with England in the winter of 1996-97, the left-armer was ribbing his captain for a lack of fishing success and was then left out of the next match. Even if there were chiefly cricketing reasons at play, a bloodied 90kg mako with a note attached to its fin “Athers, this is a fish” – probably did not help Mullally’s case.There are five enthusiastic newcomers in the current touring party (six if you count Mullally’s fellow southpaw, Sam Curran, who had already won caps in the other formats). But as much as the head coach, Chris Silverwood, intends to continue the relaxed environment of his predecessor, Trevor Bayliss, the chances of Eoin Morgan finding the catch of the day under his covers after a defeat feel slim.Tuesday’s collapse in Nelson has made the only day-night match of this tour a must-win given Morgan’s continued assertion that, while blooding players is high on the list of priorities, a series victory remains top. With that in mind, sitting 2-1 down, the experienced Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan are both in line for returns to the XI one match sooner than previously planned.England will want another look at Tom Banton, the 360-degree Somerset opener who briefly crackled on debut for 18 before being bowled on the scoop. As well as a seamer making way – Pat Brown is shading Saqib Mahmood by way of returns but has played one more match – James Vince, whose loose dismissal for 49 felt the most squandered opportunity on the day, may well be the one left out.This sweet moment for the 23-year-old from Bolton was, like the best exponents of his craft, a rewarding piece of calculation too. Suspecting Tim Seifert to be lining up the reverse slog-sweep, Parkinson had the confidence to fire down a slider that nutmegged the right-hander and lit up the stumps.Parkinson admitted afterwards he was “gutted” to only get two overs (one for 14) though understood why Morgan held him back from a later spell the wind had changed and two left-handers were at the crease. Nevertheless, with a strong action and the bravery to toss the ball up, he looked the part in this brief showing.“There were no nerves playing the game, that was more the build-up, waking up in the morning and trying to go to sleep the night before,” said Parkinson. “Trying to get through the time between waking up and then getting to the ground and training too. The actual game came as a relief.”Parkinson is one of four England players in both squads on tour (Mahmood, Sam Curran and Joe Denly, nursing an ankle injury, are the other three). His spot follows a second season as the T20 Blast’s leading spinner and a 10-wicket championship match at Hove played over the same weekend that England won the World Cup.Just hours after the Sussex match he and his twin brother, Callum – the Leicestershire left-arm spinner who was glad to see England bowl first on Tuesday due to a bleep test the next morning – lost their mother, Maria, aged only 50. “I like to think that I’ve used the tragic thing that happened in July to spur me on. If hadn’t used it in a positive way then I don’t think I’d be here playing for England,” said Parkinson.At Napier’s McLean Park, a rugby-cum-cricket ground with a reputation for runs, Parkinson will be bowling to shorter square boundaries. England’s batsmen failed to adapt to similar dimensions during the second game at Wellington’s Cake Tin and now have a fresh angle to deal with in Trent Boult.It will be Boult’s first white-ball international since a central role in the dramatic end to the World Cup final he replaces the rested Lockie Ferguson as one of two new arrivals along with Shane Bond as a temporary bowling coach. Like Mullally and his shark back in the day, the left-armer will be keen to make mischief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6017413bea4235351ea85ba9eb39aa897d3b8ba1/1_0_5369_3223/master/5369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e60ec56fc2d9d3c5d265f7353d8a188","title":"smartphone replace nokia lumia mobile price","story":"Jim doesn’t need a high-end mobile, but would like something he can rely on at a decent priceMy Nokia Lumia 820 smartphone is approaching obsolescence after six years’ use. Apart from that, I used a second-hand iPhone for a week before it failed, but I have never used an Android phone. I am clearly not someone who places a premium on having the latest phone, but I would like something I can rely on. I don’t use phones for music on the go – I still use iPods – and I very rarely watch videos on them: I use my laptop for that. I have a sim-only contract and the idea of spending £700 or so on a phone doesn’t really apply to my wants, needs or financial reality. JimThe Lumia smartphone business was one of Microsoft’s most spectacular – and most expensive – flops. Users loved their Lumias, but there were never enough of them. Also, there weren’t enough apps to attract switchers from Apple and Android. Microsoft’s selling proposition was that developers could write “universal” apps that would run on Windows 10 smartphones and laptops, and on Xbox games consoles, thus reaching hundreds of millions of users. Alas for Microsoft, that idea didn’t attract developers. The company’s new chief executive, Satya Nadella, shut down the smartphone business that the former boss, Steve Ballmer, had bought from Nokia.However, iOS is exclusive to Apple while Android is readily available, so Microsoft will re-enter the smartphone market late next year with its own innovative, dual-screen Surface Duo running Android 10. This is clearly aimed at business users – including people like me – but it does suggest that Android will ultimately offer the best experience with the whole Microsoft ecosystem, including Windows PCs, software and Azure cloud services. This reduces your problem to picking the best mid-range Android phone.But you can certainly get something that will meet your needs for about £200 to £250, if not less. At that price, you lose some processor speed, fast graphics, storage space, and some screen and camera quality. However, all the major brands I’ve seen have been robust enough, and fast enough, for ordinary purposes.One of Motorola’s advantages in the UK market is that it has a venerable American brand name. In fact, the original Motorola was taken over by Google, which sold the phone part to Lenovo, which is Chinese. Rivals such as Xiaomi and Huawei don’t have such venerable names, and Xiaomi was only founded in 2010. However, both outsell Motorola in smartphones, and both have some excellent mid-range models.My colleague Samuel Gibbs, who reviews phones for the , recently picked the Xiaomi Mi A2 as a bargain buy, and at £169 with 6GB of memory and 128GB of storage, it still is. The version with 4GB64GB is not such good value at £259, and the gold-coloured model even worse at £319.I’ve put together a comparison of some options at GSM Arena.Microsoft has chosen to go with Google’s Android rather than fork it and do its own version, as Amazon did with Fire OS. However, it already offers Microsoft Launcher (see video) which connects to Your Phone running on Windows 10 PCs. This is not a bad approach for people who want their smartphone to work with their laptop.Some people just want tiles that make their Android smartphones look much like your old Lumia. That shouldn’t be too difficult because you can do it by downloading mostly-free apps from the Google Play store. Tiles can be provided by installing, for example, XinYi’s WP Launcher, ChYK’s Square Home, Spark Planet’s Win 10 Launcher, Win Launcher 2019, or Launchers World’s WP 8 Launcher 2019. There are lots.Both WP Launcher and Square Home 3 are free to install but you may need to make in-app purchases in WP Launcher or upgrade to the highly-rated Square Home Key (£3.89).A few websites have described more extensive customisations, with 7 Labs using WP Launcher, AI Type Keyboard, Messaging 7, WP7 ContactDialer, Windows Phone Notifications and ZPlayer to get something more like a Windows smartphone. Windows Central uses some different apps recommended on Reddit, including Nova Launcher Prime and KLWP Live ($5 each). A few comments on Reddit suggest this might be harder to set up.Just installing an app like WP Launcher will get you familiar tiles instead of Android icons, without the integration provided by Microsoft’s Launcher. However, changing the “look and feel” doesn’t magically rewrite the underlying operating system. The changes are little more than skin deep, though they might help you make the transition to a new platform.Have you got a question?

It will be priced at £5.99 a month, cheaper than rivals, with its backers hoping to capitalise on the interest in family viewing in the run-up to Christmas.The deal will mean it is the first time that all the UK’s traditional channels have managed to successfully bring together programmes on a single streaming service, enabling viewers to watch archive content from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.BritBox was founded as a joint-venture between ITV and the BBC, although the commercial broadcaster is taking the lead and owns most of it. The service had already announced the addition of parts of Channel 5’s back catalogue – including the Bafta-winning Cruising with Jane McDonald – plus material from Comedy Central.Until now, Channel 4 had been a holdout, but it is understood the broadcaster has agreed to provide programmes to the service, including material from its Film4 arm and recently broadcast shows. Channel 4’s shows will join the service early next year.BritBox has already launched in test mode with a limited range of programmes, including classic comedies such as Absolutely Fabulous, The Thick Of It and Only Fools and Horses.It offers many boxsets ranging from ITV’s Brideshead Revisited to recent BBC dramas such as McMafia, plus classic British films including more than a dozen from the Carry On series.

No nation is directly named in the report.“The only two countries with capacity and motive to mount the strike were the UAE and Egypt,” Millett told the . “It is clear the finger of blame is being pointed to the UAE. It is time the security council called this out. If this war continues much longer Libya will have become a failed state, and the responsibility will lie with the outside powers.”He added that Turkey was the third country pouring arms into Libya in support of the UN-backed Government of National Accord which has been under attack in Tripoli from Libyan warlord Khalifa Haftar’s forces, the Libyan National Army. Libya is subject to a UN arms embargo.Millett said the coordinates of the detention centre had been given to Haftar’s forces so the strike against the detention centre was either the product of a dreadful accident or a terrible crime.The confidential report from the UN’s panel of experts presented to the security council on Wednesday said it is highly probable that a foreign jet launched the guided weapon on behalf of the Libyan National Army. The report said: “An unknown number of Mirage 2000-9 fighter jets were operating from two airbases inside Libya at the time of the strike.” The two airbases are named as Al Khadim and Al Jufra.“It is highly probable that the airstrike was carried out using precision-guided missiles by a fighter jet operated by a UN member state acting in direct support of Haftar armed forces,” the report said.It says the likelihood that the detention centre would be hit by two “dumb” bombs, as opposed to precision-guided missiles, would be “very low”.Haftar’s air force does not have the equipment or ordinance types to support the operation of such aircraft. Only UAE and Egypt have the Mirage 2000-9 jets in the region.No direct reference was made to the panel of experts’ report during an open session of the security council on Libya, although numerous calls were made for more to be done to protect refugees, as well as to find those responsible for the detention centre attack.Militia supporting the UN-recognised Government of National Accord based in Tripoli had an arms supply dump near to the detention centre.At the UN security council session, the international criminal court (ICC) prosecutor Fatou Bensouda pointed out that one of Haftar’s supporters wanted by the ICC over alleged war crimes had been promoted from major to lieutenant general in July.“Two arrest warrants against Mahmoud Mustafa Busayf Al-Werfalli remain unexecuted more than two years since the first warrant was issued,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/635273506383e31e59f6d12aa277a07c53757598/0_866_5988_3593/master/5988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90a55ce92fa4b77bc8c28bc0ae5ca1d3","title":"forest guardians the ashaninka of peru","story":"In an area of the Amazon vulnerable to illegal loggers, Cool Earth, a UK-based charity, is working with the Asháninka people to reduce deforestation.

However, there are mixed views on what type of change and how much is needed.The findings are based on two rounds of consultation with 41 secondary schools conducted by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) as part of a broader review of the senior cycle. The study was carried out in the school year 2018-19 and recorded what participants believe are the positive and negative aspects of the senior cycle programme and how they believe current challenges could be tackled.According to participants, a reformed senior cycle should include spreading assessment out over the course or two or three years and using a wider variety of methods to assess student performance, such as project work, portfolios and presentations.Teachers strongly emphasised that assessments should continue to be marked externally to maintain a fair and transparent system.Participants also felt senior cycle should embed “life skills” in the curriculum to better prepare young people for further or higher education, employment and adult life.Work experienceAmong the suggestions included were work experience, the development of life skills such as online safety and handling social media and enhancing personal skills such as independence and resilience. Some participants supported greater flexibility in terms of combining different elements of senior cycle programmes.For example, some suggested the option of taking Leaving Cert Applied modules alongside some subjects from the traditional Leaving Certificate, or allowing students to take subjects or courses at a different pace or degree of difficulty to cater for different abilities.Participants also felt such reforms would help to address current challenges, including a heavy workload and pressure to “cover the course”, which result in a focus on rote learning. These issues were seen as having a negative effect on student wellbeing, with young people reducing their involvement in sports and social activities in the build-up to the exams. Students were particularly vocal about the impact on their stress levels, with even junior cycle students expressing apprehension at facing the pressure of the senior cycle.On the positive aspects of the senior cycle, teachers and parents pointed to several strengths such as the range of subjects available to study and the value of transition year in providing a variety of learning experiences. Transition yearStudents were also very positive about transition year and highlighted positive relationships with their teachers and felt they were increasingly treated like adults after moving to the senior cycle. However, students were more critical of senior cycle than teachers and parents and contrasted the interactive methods used in junior cycle with the exam-focused approach in senior cycle.Emer Smyth, one of the report’s authors, said the consultation has shown the “value of listening to young people on issues that affect their lives”. “Young people provide a clear vision of the kinds of learning that would help develop them to their potential and prepare them for the changing world ahead of them. Their views should be taken into account in any changes to senior cycle,” she said,The NCCA’s consultation over the senior cycle has so far included 10 rounds of focus group meetings, a national forum attended by more than 150 participants, and 4,300 responses to an online survey."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4074644.1573061161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"syrian refugee student wins state scholarship","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSuaad Alshleh:  ‘I would say, never lose your ambition, work hard and . . . you’ll get there.’ Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Three years ago Suadd Alshleh, a newly arrived 14-year-old Syrian asylum seeker, arrived in Ireland with dreams of becoming a doctor.This year she secured a place studying medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland after an impressive Leaving Cert which included top marks in chemistry and biology.And on Wednesday, she was was named as the first recipient of a new State scholarship for disadvantaged students studying science in higher education.She was formally awarded the €5,000-a-year scholarship, which recognises the work of Irish Nobel Prize winner Prof William C Campbell, by Minister for Education Joe McHugh.Direct provision Along the way, she has faced the kind of challenges few other Irish students could imagine.She and her parents fled Syria in 2011 and relocated to the United Arab Emirates for a few years before seeking asylum with her mother in Ireland in August 2016. They were later joined by the father.They spent nine months in a direct provision centre in Co Monaghan waiting for their papers, after which they moved to Portlaoise. “My mother and I were in a room that wasn’t very big. There’ s the issue of food, I was used to my mom’s cooking . . . “It was probably the hardest time of my life. Those nine months, I’ve kind of blocked them out. But look where I am now. Without that experience, I probably wouldn’t be here. I’m very grateful,” she says.She studied at Mountmellick Community School – because her local school didn’t offer Leaving Cert chemistry – and had to rely on a lift from a neighbour because they didn’t have a car.And she also had to deal with being seen as an “alien” wearing a headscarf in communities which were not always used to ersity.Home nowWhile Home now her experience in direct provision was tough, she has nothing but praise for the support she has received since arriving in Ireland.“It was difficult at first. But I’ve had very positive experiences with the Irish community. I’m very happy to be here. I have loads of Irish friends and wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This is my home now.”Her mother, Wesam Jouma, and father Issam Alshleh – both engineers – watched proudly and took photographs s as she spoke to the media.“It’s a spectacular achievement, we’re so proud,” beamed her mother. “She worked her heart out, that’s it !”As for Suadd, she feels a sense of responsibility: as a member of the Syrian refugee community, she wants to show there are good news stories.“As a Syrian refugee, I’m incredibly grateful for the Irish community as a whole for embracing me as one of their own and supporting and encouraging me, through initiatives like this, to realise my dream of studying medicine.”“I hope to get through this very tough degree. I want to be a successful doctor and am very interested in surgery.” She also wants to send a message to other young people in direct provision or in challenging circumstances.“I would say, never lose your ambition, work hard and . . . you’ll get there.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Go Safe says bulk of its services will be running despite industrial actionRobust defence to be mounted against claims, says chief of hospital development boardQuinn Industrial Holdings chief Liam McCaffrey says interview with his attacked colleague brought back \u0026lsquoall the horror in one fell swoop\u0026rsquoESRI report finds strong appetite for senior cycle reform among pupils, parents and teachersInvestigation underway after Chihuahuas discovered in the boot of a car at Dublin PortPlans for \u0026lsquoNorman Wexford\u0026rsquo attraction and \u0026lsquoone of great gardens of the world\u0026rsquo in WaterfordLegislation ensures gift cards valid for at least five yearsKyle Duggan (31) sentenced for attacks on elderly men in Cork city centreSite\u0026rsquos visitor numbers have grown steadily from 27,000 in 2016 to over 81,000 in 2019Pilot\u0026rsquos damages case opens before High Court judge and juryJessica Sheedy (18), from Bruff, Co Limerick, had attended for a planned operationDarren Cusack (47) pleaded guilty to possession of drugs for sale or supply"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4075433.1573110543!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"speed camera operators to go on strike on thursday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSpeed camera staff on strike will protest outside Leinster House.Speed camera operators who are members of the trade union Siptu are to stage another strike on Thursday.

They will remain so until at least the new year, by which time a drink-addled post-Christmas media may have forgotten this latest episode of Dáil delinquency. Or until a suitable technology is embedded in the voting stalls to prevent deputies voting for themselves and on behalf of others.Votegate, as it became known, shone an unwelcome light on the cavalier attitude of some politicians to doing their Dáil duty. They are very privileged to possess a vote in the national parliament and their electorate expects them to exercise it wisely. Instead, some came to view it as a bothersome chore or an optional extra. Now that the game is up, votes are conducted with a showy display of full care and attention. The Ceann Comhairle calls on everyone to take their seats, precipitating a gallop of the virtuous to their allotted pews. Numbers coming into the chamber – from nearby offices or wherever else – have increased. It looks suspiciously like the party whips have been doing some serious cracking.Take yesterday afternoon, in the middle of a monumentally dull Dáil day when hardly a sinner stirred in the chamber and the public corridors of Leinster House were draped in leaden silence. And yet, when a vote was called late in the afternoon on the minor “Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment ) Bill 2019 – Amendment 5”, there was a rush to the chamber when the bells rang. Not only that, but the turnout included the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, almost every member of Cabinet, leader of Fianna Fáil and a healthy contingent from the main Opposition party. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald wasn’t present , but that didn’t matter as her former leader, Gerry Adams, was garnering most of the attention on the Shinner benches with his new hairstyle. Serious business Once the buttons have been pressed and the minute allowed for this is up, the serious business of making sure everything has been properly conducted in accordance with the rules can begin. Since votegate, this now involves a swarm of tellers from all representative groups, along with a few officials, clustering around a table on the floor of the chamber and scrutinising the result. There are furrowed brows as they all bend and look at the voting map, before scanning the benches to make sure the right people voted in the right place. There is some very serious counting followed by the mass whipping out of Biros and a frenzy of signing on the dotted lines. As they lean in and look down at the table, the tellers look like a group of road workers peering into a hole. All they are missing is the shovels. Away from shovels and the novelty of voting shenanigans, a never-ending crisis was wheeled out again during Leader’s Questions. The hospital trolley league of limitless shame was contested during another round of fruitless argument between the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil leaders. Comparing trolleys is all they ever do when discussing the crisis in emergency departments. The Taoiseach said as much when Micheál Martin took him to task over the crisis (679 on trolleys countrywide that morning, according to Micheál).“This is a really difficult problem and it has been with us for decades. We know that there are also problems in many other countries as well,” said Leo Varadkar. But they are doing everything possible to deal with the crisis.And anyway, you had more trolleys on your watch when you were minister than I had on mine when I was minister, Leo told Micheál, as Labour’s Brendan Howlin (another former health minister) chortled, “I’m enjoying this history lesson.” Like two stags locking horns, only in this case ramming into each with hospital trolleys. It’s a never-ending, tit-for-tat, who was the worst minister of them all in the pantheon of overall duds. “No disrespect,” said Micheál, but “people are finding it difficult to comprehend this ongoing, sort of robotic, detached response” from the Taoiseach to their emergency department ordeals. There is “a huge disconnect” between what he says in the Dáil, with his facts and figures, and the reality on the ground. “Either we’re not all getting it or the people out there aren’t getting it and you have some insight that no one else has in terms of the reality of people’s experiences in our emergency departments and in our hospitals.”Furthermore, continued the Fianna Fáil leader, he finds Leo’s explanations about the jobs moratorium in health are “becoming very irritating and annoying”.Do something about it. Have “a fundamental reflection and rethink”. On his trolley Leo then climbed up on his trolley. “I don’t mean any disrespect to you either, but your self-righteousness knows no limits. Let’s not forget – I’ll give you some facts – that you were minister for health once,” he began, pushing back at Micheál.“He was a much better one than you . . .” Fianna Fáil’s Fiona O’Loughlin loyally tutted.Leo was on a trolley roll. “And you were famous for chiding Tallaght hospital for not ordering enough trolleys when they were famously treating people in the car park.” Sure he didn’t even know how many people were on the trolleys “those days” because they wouldn’t, even couldn’t count them. “So, you should be off your high horse when it comes to this one.” Michael Healy-Rae (has a horse outside) lost patience with the argument between the two sides which still operate a confidence-and-supply agreement keeping Fine Gael in power. “You wouldn’t have a horse only for Fianna Fáil.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons november 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Charity launched for UK disasters backed by Duke of Cambridge to give public single donation point they can trustComment: Extinction Rebellion cannot be allowed to become \u0026#39above the law\u0026#39Comment: Iran is winning the war for the Middle East, and the West has no convincing responseComment: The Tories\u0026#39 botched game plan in the Labour heartlands could cost Boris Johnson this electionPrivate school pupils earn 10 per cent more by the time they are 25, study finds\u0026#39It could have been a bloodbath\u0026#39: Checkpoint Charlie as the Berlin Wall fell downMan arrested after 15 people found alive in lorry in WiltshireBreast cancer survivors can halve risk of early death with 20 minutes exercise a day   Recycling is too complicated and polluters should pay for waste instead of taxpayers, councils sayLearning outside for just one lesson a week boosts learning and behaviour, say researchersSeveral injured as Piccadilly Theatre ceiling collapses during Death of a Salesman performanceBoris Johnson fires starting gun for election campaign at Donald Trump-style rally in BirminghamBoris Johnson makes campaign stop in Scotland with pledge to \u0026#39never give up on our incredible Union\u0026#39Minister crowns chaotic 48 hours for No 10 as party stumbled over attempts to seize political agenda Comment: The Labour Party will be a meaner, nastier place without Tom Watson Tom Watson announces shock resignation as MP and Labour Deputy Leader\u0026#39Reckless\u0026#39 Labour to send public debt soaring with £600bn borrowing spreeLost masterpiece found broken in two in gallery storage, after BBC expert identified it from cow\u0026#39s backsidesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed a level grades versus fees find leading private schools","story":"with ever rising fees, how do you work out which independent school offers the best return on your investment?Does sending your children to a private school mean they will get better A-level grades?

The diploma has a focus on breadth of learning and students take six subjects which must include a literature, maths, a language, a science and a humanity. Each subject is marked out of 7, which is equivalent to to top grade A* in A-levels.Students must also study a course in theory of knowledge and complete an extended essay on a topic of their choice, which between them are worth an extra three points.To be awarded the IB diploma, you are also required to take up a creative pursuit, a physical activity and participate in a form of community service.

Nobody can be sure how this Battle for Britain will pan out, any more than in .Tory election manager Isaac Levido told staff this week: “There is a steep and narrow path to victory.”Another aide says: “It is unknowable. This is fraught with danger.”Polls are all over the place, some showing an easily blown Tory lead of six per cent — less than Theresa May’s before she lost her majority.Momentum Labour has made a flying start with social media, bombarding targeted voters with eye-catching and wildly misleading messages — just as it did so successfully in .“You would think the Tory machine might have learned from that debacle, but they haven’t,” says an insider. “And you can’t build a new system overnight from scratch.”The challenge for the Tories is to define the battle lines within the first two weeks.“If it is a choice between Boris and Brexit or a second referendum — or even a third referendum — we are in a good place,” says an insider.But with five parties in this fight — the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit Party and SNP — lines rapidly blur.Tory rebels such as Phil Hammond can also wreak havoc by standing as independents.Even Boris’s own ,-majority Uxbridge marginal is under threat from a bizarre invasion of Extinction Rebellion and Stop HS protesters.Nigel Farage, stung by Boris’s successful EU deal, has stunningly over-reached, threatening to field  Brexit Party candidates — although he won’t risk standing himself.His wrecking ball move has backfired among old allies including Leave campaign partner Arron Banks and one-time Ukip MP Douglas Carswell.His own party chiefs are in revolt, with Farage under pressure to back down fast.Cash donors have begun deserting and pro-Brexiteers are voting with their feet.One Sun reader, Brian Pearsall — a “paid-up Brexit Party supporter” — tells me: “I will be backing Boris. Mr Farage is beginning to annoy me. If he wants us to get out he should put candidates only in seats where the Tories have no chance of winning. What the hell’s got into him ”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has also misjudged the national mood by junking Brexit altogether — and campaigning to rejoin the EU.Her party has slipped in the polls and she is offering pacts to a ragbag of Greens, Plaid Cymru and any other minority group who might offer a hand.Yet every vote picked up by Swinson and Farage in Tory target marginals opens the door to a Labour advance.The stakes in this General Election have never been higher — or clearer. More than million adults voted in  to leave the European Union.Unless they have changed their minds, this is their last chance of seeing that wish come true.No more ritual humiliation of humble MPs who incur his wrath or ministers who dare challenge his petty tyranny.Parliament will take a while to recover its ­dignity after a torrid ten-year political trauma.

Evenwe can argue about the “weather” bit.Two contestants, though, go straight into the all-time Apprentice Hall Of Fame, alongside the greats like Paul Torrisi and Stuart Baggs.First is Cockney barrow boy Thomas Skinner, who sticks out among the boys like Ray Winstone in a touring production of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert, and has turned out to be a lot more likeable than I was expecting.The second, though, most certainly hasn’t. For she is Lottie Lion, the librarian and wine snob who’s given to quoting Shakespeare: “For though she is but little she is a massive pain in the a**e.” Or words to that effect.All your worst office nightmares rolled into one, this girl. An undermining, ­passive-aggressive crawler who can swivel on a sixpence, depending on which way Lord Sugar’s wind is blowing.“In business there is no room for ­gambling.” “Hang on. Business is a gamble. You don’t take risks, you get nowhere.” “Yes, risk-taking is important, Lord Sugar.”Lottie’s also not helped by the fact she’s often right and most certainly wasn’t to blame for the failure of the scavenger hunt task which disintegrated, in ­shameful fashion, right at the start when team Empower’s Pamela Laird asked: “Does anyone know when the Second World War started ” Silence. They didn’t know when it started, ­finished, or even what side was responsible for killing Biggie and Tupac.A media meltdown followed, yet, amid the general despair, no one bothered to thank The Apprentice for the public ­service of flagging up this ignorance, because that’s not what happens with this show. Instead, it gets accused of stuff.This year, inevitably, it’s been called racist and claims have been made that the first four candidates were sacked due to their skin colour, rather than the fact they were completely useless or ­produced a “bespoke ­corporate ­lollipop” that looked more like a vibrator.It’s only Twitter that’s saying these things, of course, but they need to be quashed as the BBC is actually dumb enough to listen to these imbeciles and forget Sugar’s first winner was Tim Campbell and his show is about the only place on the network where black and minority ethnic people will be treated entirely on their merits.Get rid of The Apprentice and, I guarantee you, its ­precious and entertaining hours will be filled with the same mollycoddling, box-ticking, ­condescending, right-on ­b*****ks that fills most of the rest of the Beeb’s output.Treasure this show while you still can .The One Show, Matt Baker: “I’m very much looking forward to talking about your play, Meera [Syal].”The X Factor: Celebrity, Louis Walsh to Jenny Ryan: “Very few people can sing Shirley Bassey but you nailed every single note.”With a Black  Decker staple gun and no anaesthetic.ONLY two places there’s ever likely to be a demand for Vinnie Jones to sing Lip Up Fatty, by Bad Manners.One of them is Piers Morgan’s Hollywood wake.Thankfully, that’s probably still a good  or  months away.So I’ll stick with the other, X Factor: Celebrity, where we were already several horrors into the night when Martin Bashir’s brain developed technical issues, just as he was about to assault the second verse of EasyLike Sunday Morning.“I’ve forgotten the words . . .“A wah wah-waaah wanna be freeeee.“I do apologise.”Not necessary, Martin.Vinnie’s manic can-can took the initial sting out of things a couple of turns later.And, when it came to the climax, Simon Cowell dodged his decision and the public voted-off Jonny Labey and Victoria Ekanoye instead of a startled Bashir, who gasped: “What has happened ”You stayed silent. They sang. Go figure.Seven Worlds, One Planet cutting and pasting that horrendous old footage of the sky-ing walruses.A BBC continuity woman deciding His Dark Materials is our “new Sunday night obsession”. .The slyly partisan One Show featuring a film with Corbynista Ken Loach calling for “real change”, on the day the election was called.And arch-luvvie David Tennant describing the responsibility of murdering one Proclaimers song for Children In Need: Got It Covered as: “A bit like National Service.”For you or the viewers, David THE guessing games begin as soon as the opening credits for BBC’s big new Sunday night drama kick in and reveal it’s set in a parallel universe.A place where relationships between humans and their animal soul-mates are unusually close.Swindon “Oxford.”Oooh, close, but no cigar at the start of His Dark Materials, an epic, eight-part adaptation of author Philip Pullman’s trilogy that’ll probably go down well with anyone who’s read the books and loves fantasy adventure.Unfortunately, I haven’t read the books and hate fantasy adventure.My loss, I realise. It means I draw an emotional blank with the show’s incredible production valuesand even Ruth Wilson’s fabulous performance as Mrs Coulter.Initial stumbling block is the fact everyone’s trailed around by their own soul in animal form, Daemons who can all talk but never once stop to take a dump or cock their leg against the scenery.Teenage heroine Lyra has a shape-shting weasel thing called Pantalaimon, James “Asriel” McAvoy’s got Stelmaria the snow leopard and John Torode’s got a hairless gastropod called Gregg. But that’s another show, I think.On this one, there’s also the all-powerful Magisterium, giving everyone the creeps, and the uncharted north’s mysterious city in the sky, which James McAvoy is getting quite excited about.The detail that finished off His Dark Materials for me, though, was the news that arrived just before the climax of episode one.“Roger’s been taken by the Gobblers.”As the late, great Eric Morecambe once said, there really is no answer to that.Would it be fair to assume the BBC’s bisexual Dracula bats for both sides BBC’s darkly funny Guilt, with Mark Bonnar and Jamie Sives.The nightmarish, bird-eating Iranian viper footage on Seven Worlds One Planet.Lee Mack pretending to be Anneka Rice’s nude le model on the outstanding Would I Lie To You .C’s brilliant Celebrity Hunted climaxing with the question: “Is Gavin Henson really stupid enough to go back to his own house ” .And best ever breakfast TV host, Piers Morgan, marking his eagerly awaitedto Good Morning Britain by identying singer Ruby Turner as the rhyming slang for curry, “Ruby Murray”.Food food food, Piers.Clinton Morrison: “I think Mesut Ozil had a prove to point.”Jeff Stelling: “For United this is a matter of extreme danger with a capital X.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Piglet and Eeyore are companions of which fictional bear ”Matt: “Donkey.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Pemberton Place in Atlanta is named after the inventor of what soft drink ”Glynis: “Orange.”Bradley Walsh: “Which cabinet designer ­published a book of his own designs in  ”Vivien: “Mr Ikea.”And Bradley Walsh: “Dingoes are said to have been introduced to Australia by whom ”Kirsten: “The Kennel Club.”SO what’s it like in the non-stop Mardi Gras of ­EastEnders at the moment Callum: “I’ve been thinking of taking an ­embalming course.”CHILDREN In Need: Got It Covered.My ears: Got ’em covered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet the way Ahmed’s case has been pumped up as a great cause celebre for women is frankly ridiculous.The real scandal is not that a highly paid female BBC presenter has been paid less than a male one. It is that the BBC is lavishing such fat pay on any of them while pleading poverty and ending free TV licences for people over .Ahmed’s case for equal pay is very weak. It is based on the argument that presenting Newswatch — which holds BBC’s news programmes to account — is of equal value to presenting Vine’s old show, Points Of View, which invited comments from the public on a wide iety of BBC programmes.The BBC claims the disparity is down to the fact that Points Of View is classied as entertainment while Newswatch comes under news.  Surely a more direct comparison would be between what Ahmed is paid and what her male predecessor, Raymond Snoddy, was paid.She received the same as he did. How is that gender discrimination   But while the BBC might have a strong defence in Ahmed’s case, it doesn’t endear the corporation to me.Every time the BBC Charter comes up for renewal, it poses as a terribly worthy public ­service broadcaster putting out serious, educational programmes no commercial broadcaster would touch.Unless the Government allows it to jack up the licence fee, it argues, it will mean no more David Attenborough, no more news correspondents in Mogadishu.Then, as soon as the BBC Charter is renewed, it goes back to pumping out the same old entertainment shows, many of them indistinguishable from commercial TV.A genuine public service broadcaster would not pay Gary Lineker £.million a year, Graham Norton £,or Huw Edwards £,.Compared with the fattest of BBC fat cats, Samira Ahmed might well feel undervalued. Yet earning £ for presenting a -minute programme would be a dream for many TV licence-payers, many of whom do not even earn that amount of money in a week.The BBC is merciless in its efforts to collect what is really a tax on TV ownership. Unlike other unpaid utility bills, failing to buy a TV licence is a criminal offence, leading to low-paid people struggling with finances being dragged through the courts.Last year, , people were prosecuted for non-payment. By the way,  per cent of them were women — possibly because they were more likely to be at home during the day when TV licence enforcement officers tend to call. That is the real gender unfairness, not highly paid female BBC presenters receiving less money than male presenters.Ahmed’s case has highlighted the old boys’ world from which the BBC hires its presenters.  Vine, she claims, was “gted” his Radio  show without any proper recruitment process. BBC management then allowed his agent to jack up his salary.The BBC seems to see itself as immune from the pay restraint where in the public sector. When David Cameron became Prime Minister, he said any public body would need an extremely good excuse to pay anyone more than the £, a year he then earned.Yet the BBC’s accounts for   show it paid  “on-air talent” salaries in excess of this figure.  While there have been token reductions for some male ­presenters, such as the now- retired John Humphrys, many have seen salary increases.High pay doesn’t end with the presenters. There were also  BBC managers and executives who were paid more than the PM last year.  If the BBC wants to justy the TV licence, it needs to be cutting excessive pay among its board and ­presenters.If it wants to be a commercial station, on the other hand, it should give up the licence fee and find funding from subscriptions and ­advertising.  Then it wouldn’t be our business how much its executives and presenters were paid because their salaries would come out of the pockets only of people who chose to subscribe to its programmes.This is particularly important now, in the week that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have vowed to sort out the threat of over-s losing their licence fee exemption.As it becomes an urgent election issue, the worst look for the BBC is to be seen throwing money at presenters rather than the people it needs most — its loyal viewers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After two years of Parliamentary battles and a souring of politics, more than  MPs have decided not to stand again. Some - like longest-serving MP Ken Clarke and Sir Winston Churchillaposs grandson Nicholas Soames - are retiring after decades of service. But others have decided the venom and anger around Brexit are making them want to call it a day. Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public le has been utterly dehumanising - and former Chancellor Philip Hammond. And key Tory Remainers like Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan led an exodus of prominent female MPs complaining about abuse. Meanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally bowing out after nearly a decade and , ORDERs in the grand chair in the House of Commons. And Labouraposs deputy leader Tom Watson came in late with a shock resignation, leaving as an MP altogether alongside his party post. Hereaposs the full list of MPs whoaposve announced they are standing down so far.  Tom Watson announced he is to stand down as an MP and is quitting frontline politics after  years. In recent years Watson has clashed with leader Jeremy Corbyn over the partyaposs Brexit policy and allegations of anti-Semitism within the party. In the -year-oldaposs resignation letter he did not say he wants Corbyn to become Prime Minister in next monthaposs general election. In his resignation letter Watson, who survived an attempt to oust him at the Labour party conference earlier this year, said: Now is the right time for me to stand down from national politics. The disagreements we have had inside the party are well-known now is not the time to rehearse them again. Philip Hammond stepped down as an MP with a furious parting shot at Prime Minister Boris Johnson . The Former Tory Chancellor was booted out of the Tory parliamentary party after defying Johnson over Brexit . Hammond said he would not stand as an independent in Runnymede and Weybridge, because that would mean leaving the Conservative Party entirely - something he is not willing to do. In his letter to constituents he unleashed a broadside against Johnson for withdrawing the whip over Brexit. I am saddened to find myself in this position after  years of Conservative Party membership, Hammond wrote.  When people talk about “Tory Big Beasts”, the image they have in their head is -year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushclfe MP holds the title of ‘father of the house’ - which means he’s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour ’s Dennis Skinner. And he’s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron. In fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the  years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major. He’s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since . And he’s perhaps been the Conservative Party’s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. John Bercow  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe. The ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in . Amber Rudd  Ms Ruddaposs departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs. She resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with  Tories who lost the whip in September. Yet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option. Born in London in , she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald. She went to Cheltenham Ladiesapos College and Queenaposs College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University. She married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the s but later orced. Gill, who died in , referred to Rudd as aposthe Silver Spoonapos in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral. Ms Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed. An internal inquiry later found she was not given full information herself. Her brother Roland Rudd runs the Peopleaposs Vote campaign - where he is embroiled in a furious row with his own staff over a botched bid to oust senior staff.  Boris Johnsonaposs younger brother suggested the PM was failing the national interest as he announced heaposd quit in September. The Orpington MP said he had been torn between family loyalty and the national interest but that it was time for othersto take on his role. The Universities and Science minister had previously quit the government when Theresa May as PM over her handling of Brexit. Remainer Jo Johnson added that it had been an honour to serve his constituents since . Sir Nicholas Soames  Sir Nicholas Soames is an important talisman in Conservative circles as the grandson of Sir Winston Churchill - but lost the whip last month when he decided to block no-deal Brexit. The -year-old MP for Mid Sussex claimed a no-deal Brexit would be the most serious crisis Britain has faced since the Second World War. The a staunch pro-European who was a minister under John Major, also claimed Margaret Thatcher would not have taken the UK out of the EU. Confirming his decision he said: I will be voting against the government with a very heavy heart. But he was later spotted grinning during his final vote after  years - to trigger an election hours after having the whip restored by Boris Johnson.  The MP rose to prominence when he took on Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership following the EU referendum in . His ill-fated campaign failed to dislodge Corbyn, though he did finish with more than % of membersapos votes. The MP of nine years later worked in Jeremy Corbynaposs Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary while Stormont was collapsed. Heidi Allen  Lib Dem Heidi Allen will quit as an MP at the next General Election , blaming the nastiness of British politics. The former Tory MP and Change UK leader switched parties more than faced elections after she initially became dissatisfied with the Conservatives over welfare cuts. She said she was heartbroken by the decision, but had become exhausted from being shouted at in the street and sworn at on social media. In a letter to her constituents in South Cambridgeshire, she wrote: I am exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace. Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home.

I feel that it’s time, at my age, that I was put out to grass.” Jim Fitzpatrick : “Labour HQ askedI’ll stand again, here is my official response. In the event of a snap election a volunteer parachutist may be neededno time for full selection procedures to represent the great seat of Poplar and Limehouse!!” Kate Hoey : “Now that the national Labour party has started the process for the  election I have decided that after  years as the MP for Vauxhall I will not seek re-election as a Labour candidate.” Roberta Blackman-Woods : “I am afraid it is just time for me to stand down for a whole host of largely personal reasons.” Gloria De Piero : I question whether I can give you the commitment you deserve for what could be a further eight years. Paul Farrelly : I also still have a young family to support, and it would not be fair on them, really, to carry on beyond the next election, with all the stresses and strains that go with the job of being a dutul member of parliament.” John Mann- resigned as an MP before election was called to take up seat in the House of Lords: The power of the Prime Minister, Speaker and the whips will all need to be reconsideredour democracy is to properly .

Consequently, I have decided that I no longer wish to be considered for re-election. Albert Owen : Being an MP is an intense full-time job. My decision not to seek re-election is for personal reasons, I simply want to do other things and spend more quality time with my family. Helen Jones : “I am deeply grateful to the voters here who have elected me at six General Elections.” Jim Cunningham : “It has been the honour of my professional le to serve as your Member of Parliament for the last  years, but the time has come to hand over the baton to someone new.” Stephen Twigg : “As I approach my mid-fties I want to have the opportunity to take on something new” Teresa Pearce : “I have made the decision to not stand at the next election, there are many reasons some personal, some not. But I will be  in February and I think it’s time to step away. It has been a real privilege to serve my community in these past nine years.” Lib Dem    Heidi Allen : “Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, nor have to install panic alarms at home. Of course public scrutiny is to be expected, but lines are all too often regularly crossed and the effect is utterly dehumanising. Norman Lamb : “I think we are in a very sad and disturbing place in our politics.” Vince Cable : “I would not be able to commit to a five year term from now until possibly  .” The Independent Group for Change Joan Ryan : “When I stood in  I always intended to serve only one more term in Parliament.” Ann Coffey : After a lot of consideration I have decided not to stand for election again.

He was in full political mode, denouncing Corbyn as a friend of Russia and boasting of advances under the Tories. Yet from hospitals to immigration his hardline attacks just don’t ring true - or left key details out. And he even got the number of days he’s been in office wrong. Here are the  biggest lies and deceptions he told on the first day of the campaign. WHAT HE SAID: It has been frankly mind-boggling in the last few weeks to see how parliament first voted to approve this deal, and then voted for delay. THE FACTS: Parliament did not vote to approve the PM’s Brexit deal. Instead it backed the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. Despite its name, second reading is basically the first hurdle a Bill goes through on the long road to becoming law. Often MPs back a Bill at second reading to secure a debate, but then vote against at a later pointit isnapost amended to be acceptable - and several said they would have done so in this case.   . Heaposs building  new hospitalsWHAT HE SAID:  new hospitals. THE FACTS: Boris Johnson ’s promise of  ‘new hospitals’ will actually only deliver six unless the Tories win the next two elections - not one future election, but two. And it includes renovations of existing hospitals.WHAT HE SAID: Go with Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, because thataposs the only alternative, who actually want to ban OFSTED, that protects kids from bullying. THE FACTS: Labour would scrap Ofsted - but in what you might think is a key detail, it would be replaced with a new two-phase inspection system. The party says all schools will be subject to regular ‘health checks’ by councils, with a more in-depth inspection led by Her Majesty’s Inspectors concerns arise. . Labour will have no controls on immigrationWHAT HE SAID: Go with Labour and a totally uncontrolled and unlimited immigration system that would put huge pressure on the NHS and other services. THE FACTS: This relates to a motion that members passed at the party conference, not a manesto pledge. However, even that motion didnapost vow to scrapallcontrols - it pledged to extend free movement and reject any immigration system based on incomes, migrants’ utility to business, and number caps targets. While this is of course a big reduction in controls, it wonapost necessarily become Labour policy going into the election as that is decided by scores of party chiefs in a aposClause Vapos manesto approval meeting. WHAT HE SAID: Corbyn would spend the whole of  having two referendums. One on Scotland – because he has done a deal with the Scots nationalists to assist the break up of the unionthey sustain him in power. THE FACTS: Labour recently ruled out allowing a Scottish independence referendum in . A spokesman said: In the early years, in the formative years of a Labour government, we wouldn’t agree to such a request. But in the longer runthere was a democratic and properly formulated request on the basis of a majority of the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish Government it would be wrong to block it.

The new Speaker of the House of Commons’ daughter, Natalie, regularly gave him vividly coloured pairs as birthday and Christmas gts.But she took her own le aged just , during what was described at the inquest as a “toxic relationship”. “Natalie used to buy me bright socks,” Sir Lindsay says, looking down at his ankles. “The rest of the family started now she’s gone. “She also gave us a sparkly pink collar for Betty, our Patterdale terrier. I wasn’t going to take her out in that – and then [Natalie] died and we wouldn’t take her for a walk in anything .”    That this Speaker’s gaudy socks have become as much of a trademark as predecessor John Bercow’s lurid ties, is a touching tribute to the child cruelly snatched from him in . Elected by MPs on Monday as First Commoner of the Land – Westminster’s th Speaker – his vulnerability shows even the most successful politicians, are real people who feel pain. “It’s hard, even hard now,” the -year-old MP for Chorley, Lancashire, admits, swallowing to suppress his emotions. “Natalie was a light so bright – I could never have expected what happened. “I’ll never get over it. I need to deal with it but it’s unbearable never to get a call saying, ‘Pops, what you doing ’ “It’s not right. We lost a daughter, my other daughter a sister and my grandchildren lost an auntie.”  Inside the imposing state rooms of Speaker’s House – the living quarters that come with the job – he admits conversations with other MPs who have lost children help him cope. “It won’t get better but it gets easier, they told me,” he says before his voice trails away.The most avuncular MP in Westminster, twice-married Sir Lindsay is the son of Doug Hoyle, a former Warrington MP now Labour peer, who watched him being dragged to the chair in a piece of archaic Parliamentary pantomime. He will have to get used to being a TV star, shouting “Order” during Prime Minister’s Questions.Yet despite being a straight talker in his  years as Bercow’s senior deputy, Sir Lindsay admits he finds it dficult to speak openly about how his feelings. “It’s hard, especially for Lancastrian lads who don’t like to talk publicly.”  Sir Lindsay describes Westminster as a village even though its , pass holders make it a sizeable town. And he will introduce a part-time GP’s surgery so everybody from security staff to lords can receive medical care on site. “We’ve a hairdresser’s but not a doctor – that can’t be right and I’m not against hairdressing,” he says. Having spent a decade chairing debates without pushing his own politics, he won’t say how he voted in the Europe referendum, this political veteran is less abrasive than Bercow. And he is keen to embrace tradition by bringing back the wig and buckled shoes worn for centuries on state occasions before Bercow dropped them. “When I was mayor of Chorley, the things they made me put on mean they’ll hold no fears for me,” he says. Sir Lindsay ran a company printing logos on police and ambulance unorms before winning his seat from the Tories in Tony Blair ’s  landslide.He would clash with Blair on university tuition fees and had a populist eye, once calling for Heathrow to be renamed in memory of Diana Princess of Wales. At heart, though, he was and still is a trade union activist, admired for treating the most junior staff with respect. Asked what makes him angry, the reply is immediate and clear. “I don’t like bullies and injustice.” Recalling an incident when a tearful waitress in the Commons tea room approached him about being poorly treated by a female MP, he says: “She came up to me really upset. “‘Mr Hoyle’ she said, can I have a word with you’. ‘Of course’, I said.  “She told me, nearly in tears, nobody had spoken to her like that before. “I promised it would be dealt with and I went to see the chief whip and it was. There’s no excuse for bullying. I don’t care what caused it. Whatever it was doesn’t make it acceptable. “Every member of staff is as important to me as the Clerk of the House. “I was touched they had come to see me and they can, any time. I suppose it’s the old trade unionist in me, standing up for what’s right and against wrong.” Being named after Australian cricketer Lindsay Hassett, from the “Invincibles” who whitewashed England in , helped, he chuckles, make him stronger. “When you go to school with farmers’ sons called John and Steven it doesn’t half toughen you up to be called Lindsay. “I was the boy called Sue of the song. You don’t know the stick I’ve had. “I still get mistaken for a woman. I’ll go to a hotel and say I’ve got a room booked and they’re expecting a woman.”  The mistakes continued when Sir Lindsay was elected, with his inclusion on a banner made by women in politics campaign group Emily’s List and an invite to join the Labour women’s group. “I was asked to contribute to a book to support the fight against breast cancer but they didn’t use the photo I sent.” As a lad he was sent to the Bolton private secondary school his mum had attended and “absolutely hated it”. “I wanted to be with my friends,” he says If I had my time over, never again.” Through it all the Labour party has been a lelong passion so leaving – Speakers are have to demonstrate independence – was “a toughie”, he admits. “I went to my first Labour conference in  as a baby and soon after, in Scarborough, I was throwing bacon from the high chair at Hugh Gaitskell. I was an early rebel. “I still don’t accept I’ve resigned. The membership card’s in my pocket. I haven’t chopped it up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror tories busy proving","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: The Tories are busy proving they are unfit for governmentThe resignation of Alun Cairns, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s callous Grenfell comments and James Cleverly caught doctoring a campaign videoShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  NOV Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video james-cleverly-questioned-doctored-video-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics voice-mirror-tories-busy-proving-\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Mark, , and Ruth Chalmers, , used some of their winnings to fund their daughter Natalie’s IVF treatment after she had tried for six years to conceive. Their daughter had “given up hope” of becoming a mum after suffering fertility problems and enduring five operations. The “devastated” -year-old was unable to get IVF on the NHS as her partner, Nigel Armitage, , had children. But her dreams came true after her parents scooped £million in the EuroMillions raffle in February .  Today, Mr and Mrs ­Chalmers, of Halax, West Yorks, said their first grandchild was “better than winning the lottery”. The first decision they made after their win was to fund her £, IVF treatment. Two months later she was pregnant after her first attempt and on December  last year Koby was born. Ruth, a former wages clerk at Tesco, said. “I never thought I’d have a grandchild. It was heartbreaking to watch what Natalie went through for six years. I’ve seen her in tears and in pain.  “If I could have done, I’d have had one for her, but it wasn’t possible. I thought it was so unfair that because of where she lived she couldn’t get IVF on the NHS. I never thought the day would come I’d be able to take that pain away.” Ruth remembers the call that changed her le, saying: “I was in China with my niece on holiday and Natalie called to say, ‘I can’t believe it, the first time and it’s worked – you’re going to be a grandma’. We both burst into tears.” Dad Mark said Natalie couldn’t stop crying when she called him. He said: “In between tears I heard, ‘I’m pregnant’. I asked her, ‘Why the hell are you crying ’.”  Mark had just taken early retirement after  years with Mars when he won. They were planning to take money out of his own pension to pay for IVF. Natalie, who suffers from polycystic oy syndrome, said she was distraught after doctors had told her she may need to have her tubes removed. “The lottery has made all our lives. I’m so happy,” Natalie said. “I had about five operations. They made holes in my oies to seethat helped.  “I thought I’d never have children. So when it happened I was in total shock. It didn’t really sink in until he was born and then I cried and thought, ‘he’s mine’.” Mark told how he believes winning the lottery is “fate” and revealed he left his ticket in his wallet for about a month before he checked it. He works as a landscape gardener three days a week with his brother and Ruth cares for her grandson.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man bought his own spooky castle in Wales for just £, - and after a huge renovation project it is now up for sale for £. million. Anton Jones purchased Llantwit Castle in the Vale of Glamorgan as a ruin, but  years later itaposs a highly desirable property. He had a lelong love and fascination with the ancient building, since he was spooked by an experience there when he was a child.He told Wales Online : It all started when I was a kid. I used to play here and was absolutely scared to death of it!It was very, very creepy in those days because the ruin was totally covered in ivy.    It was always very gloomy even on a summeraposs day and there was always an eerie presence here and I actually got chased by horses here once. Itaposs been a lelong ambition to own and restore at least a section of this unique former medieval home called The Old Castle, even though Anton is regularly haunted by the memory of the horses. He laughs: I can still hear the hooves hitting the stones now when Iaposm working here! Itaposs taken  years to buy the scheduled ancient monument from the Vale of Glamorgan council and five years to totally transform one wing of the medieval house into a dream home totally by hand.    So there have been no cranes, just a rope and a chain. There have been no cement mixers - all the materials have been mixed and constructed using traditional methods. There have been no trips to the buildersapos merchants to get modern plaster and pre-cut wood - Anton has used all traditional materials such as lime mortar, and the solid oak beams have been cut and constructed on site. The huge front door hinges and studs have been forged onsite using traditional blacksmith methods and all the roof and ceiling beams are fitted together with chunky, handmade wooden pegs - all just as it would have been when the house was constructed and then extended more than  years ago.  Itaposs no surprise to discover that Anton describes his occupation as a aposconservation builderapos and that for him there was no option with this property that he loves but to provide the structure with the attention to historical detail it deserves. But go back five years and maybe Anton might not have saved The Old Castleheaposd known what a struggle it would be. At the time he purchased the ruin for £, and turned up for the first day of work at the most challenging renovation project he could ever imagine, except now it was a reality. He says: It was completely ruined, in fact it shouldnapost really have been saved because it was too far gone! At least five metres off the top of the walls had to be taken down simply because it has been open to the elements for over  years. Yes, it hasnapost had a roof for over  years.  Anton says the restoration was excruciating to do, both physically and mentally. The first day was horrendous, trying to tackle the undergrowth and trees that had sprung up within and around the ruin. A huge maze of scaffolding needed to be erected, including over the top of the ruin, to at long last get the site watertight and ready for the biggest renovation Anton has ever tackled. He remembers: All the stone dressings were found buried in the floor in pieces, so we dug those up and put them all back together like a massive jigsaw piece. Hundreds of tons of stone needed to be lted in the air and we did it all with block and tackle which is the original lting mechanism just the two of us, we did it all by hand. The legend of the huge hole in the wall dates back to a time when the site was pillaged and stripped of all its internal features by thieves using a horse and cart to carry the spoils away. Anton says: We found lots of the stone from the hole buried and put them all back in one of the walls.  It was smashed out probably hundreds of years ago so people could come in and steal substantial things like all the sandstone windows and fireplaces. Anton says every aspect of the restoration was done by hand, with the roof causing the most dficulty. He says: The beams weigh about one to two tonnes each and we had to lt them six-foot up into the air. It would have been easier to build it from new. But there was no chance of that ever happening, not just because the property is listed but also because of the special atmosphere the unique house and its remaining ruins exude. Anton says: Itaposs a lovely atmosphere here, most people can feel it, itaposs a special thing. Itaposs church like and very peaceful however itaposs got a very welcoming atmosphere.  And what is special and unique about it is that thereaposs still this ruinous part attached to the home. I think to restore the remaining ruin would actually ruin it! Itaposs what makes the house so romantic. From every window there is a view that will force a new owner to linger and admire, whether itaposs views of the remaining ruins, the sea views or the rural vistas of the two acres of land that come with the property. The garden is a totally private, walled space that has many potential surprises to delight a new owner. Anton says he has found many historic coins on the land, plus a massive key he assumes once opened the front door of this home. He says: We found an actual Henry VIII crown that was connected with the early building because it was embedded in the floor, which was a brilliant find.

Simon Goldsmith, , was told he was “too comical” for the annual King’s Crown Elvis contest and would be “laughed off stage”. The postman, who raises money for charity by performing in his white sequin suit, insists he has been treated unfairly. Simon said: “I might look a bit rubbish, but I can sing and put on a really good show. “I just want to do something dferent and to be fun. “You see a lot of Elvis tributes who just go through all his tracks but I do something dferent.    “When I saw the quality of some [of the acts that] got in I thought ‘I could have done that’.” Simon, who admits he is probably Britain’s worst Elvis tribute, describes his act as “quite slapstick”. He covers modern songs by artists including Britney Spears in Elvis style,and also dresses as ‘Zombie Elvis’. Simon was hoping to donate the £ prize from last month’s competition in Ipswich, Suffolk, to a hospice in memory of his dad.    But after his application was turned down he decided to raise funds himself, making £ in just three days. Andy Sexton, the organiser of the King’s Crown Elvis competition, says he admires Simon’s charity work but stands by his decision. He said: “Our Elvis competition is not a comedy show “These guys are professionals. I choose between  to  to enter and they have to be the best.

Fashion lovers were quick to spot the Duchess wore a LOT of shirt dresses during her recent Royal Tour to Africa, and some experts believe there might be a very clever reason for this choice as well. Fashion expert Caroline Wolf believes her colourful selection might actually be a parenting hack, as the buttons are perfect for breastfeeding.    Meghan hasnapost officially said how she is feeding Archie, but insiders have said she has picked this method and the Duchess has left events promptly saying she has to get home to feed him.Caroline told the Express: Shirt dresses and tuxedo jacket dresses are a superb choice for Meghan Markle for several reasons.They are super easy to ‘put on and go’ and the collar makes them look smart yet feminine.They are often made from cotton, linen or a blend making them lightweight, fluid and super comfortable, especially in warm weather countries.   Meghan may be breast-feeding making this dress perfect for feeding Archie. And as well as having lots of practical benefits, wrap dresses are also a fashion staple at the moment - another reason Meghan probably loves them. The Mirroraposs fashion director Amber Graafland said: When it comes to style Meghan Markle has always favoured timeless classics.

She was greeted with cheers and shouts of God Save the Queen as she arrived at the Royal British Legionaposs Centenary Village in Aylesford to tour the facilities, which support members of the Armed Forces. But many fans were surprised to see she wasnapost wearing a poppy for the visit. She looked beautul in a dark purple coat and hat, which she teamed with a stunning diamond brooch. The Queen simply doesnapost wear her poppy before the Remembrance weekend, and she will have it on when she arrives at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday.She will be joined by Prince Charles, Camilla, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan Markle , Prince Harry and other members of the Royal Family for the Festival of Remembrance.   On Sunday the same group will attend the Remembrance Sunday service at The Cenotaph. The Queen will watch from the balcony while Charles lays a wreath on her behalf. During her visit to the centre today, the Queen also had a minor run-in with a guide dog, which appeared entirely unfazed as it blocked her path during her visit. Smiling, she quipped: Heaposs bored of this, I think. The Queen took her time speaking to dozens of people, listening to their stories of service for the country all over the world and in numerous dferent conflicts.    The village houses specialist accommodation for armed forces personnel and veterans and their families, as well as those with a disability and the long-term unemployed. The new Appleton Lodge is the latest part of the £ million Centenary Village development which, when complete, will provide homes and welfare support, as well as a community for vulnerable veterans. RBLI, which was formed in  to provide support to sick and wounded soldiers ing from the First World War, launched a campaign in  to build the Centenary Village, which the charity says will see it support hundreds of the most in-need ex-servicemen and women every year for another century. At every turn, the Queen was met with beaming smiles from the hundreds of schoolchildren, veterans, families and staff gathered at the village. Among those eager to meet the royal was Irene Mount, who was born in the same year as the Queen and was one of the first residents to move into the new Appleton Lodge.    The Queen said to her: You have got a nice place here, havenapost you. And they look after you well  Mrs Mount, , sitting next to her son, said she was happy at the lodge. Her husband Reginald Mount had served as Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Navy in the Fleet Air Arm and died  years ago. Turning to Mrs Mount before she left, the Queen said: I am very glad to see you today. After touring the facility, the royal was invited to unveil a plaque to officially open Appleton Lodge, which she did to cheers from the crowd. Elsewhere on the Centenary Village site, the Queen was treated to a tour of Victory House, another set of apartments for veterans. There she met Fijian-born John Ahben, who served with the Kingaposs Own Royal Border Regiment before he was involved in a car accident.    Mr Ahben, who was unconscious for more than two weeks after the incident, stayed at rehabilitation centre Headley Court several times before he joined the RBLI in . He now works as a horticulturist, tending the Cha Garden which he showed to the Queen. The Queen also met members of Britainaposs Bravest Manufacturing Company, an enterprise run by the RBLI which employs veterans and people with disabilities. The factory employs over  people,  of whom are veterans, have a health condition or both. Brigadier Steve Sherry, RBLI chief executive, said: One hundred years ago, a group of philanthropists and forward thinkers came together to set up a community encompassing homes, welfare and employment to support vulnerable veterans.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhenever her husband planned a night out with work friends, Sonia Greensill always found an excuse not to go. Weighing more than  stone, she was too ashamed to meet new people. I didn’t want to be an embarrassment to my husband, or to anyone really, she says. I used to think,they meet me then they’ll know he’s married to a fat woman. I didn’t want to be the one that people saw and thought, oh god, look at the size of her. So I’d find a reason not to go, because then I didn’t have to face it. I missed out on so much because of that, but still it wasn’t enough to stop me eating all the wrong things. I really wish it had been.    Sonia, who has two grown-up children and two grandchildren, was approaching her th birthday and weighing st lb when she decided it was time to change her le. I realised I was at the age where it was now or never, she remembers. I thoughtI didn’t do it then it would be too late. It wasn’t just about being slim, I didn’t want to stand out anymore, I wanted to be unnoticeable. Being so big, I honestly felt abnormal and I just wanted to feel normal. I felt judged all the time, and I couldn’t really argue with it. I was fat and I’d made myself that way so people had every reason to be judgemental, but it was still a horrible feeling.”    When Sonia’s daughter Sharn suggested they go to Slimming World together, she initially refused. “My daughter had put on four stones when she was about , then joined Slimming World and lost it, but put a couple back on so she thought it would be a good ideawe both went,” says Sonia. “But when she first asked me I said ‘I’m not going there, no chance.’ I hadn’t stood on the scales for years, my attitude wasI didn’t know then I didn’t have to think about it. But I started thinking maybe my daughter was worried about me, and should I be worrying about me too ” Sonia’s weigh first started to creep up in her teens – “when everyone was getting a figure, mine just kind of exploded!” she jokes. “I met my husband Colin when I was  and started eating at his house, having curries and things I’d never really eaten at home. It was this new world of food and I couldn’t get enough of it.” Rather than over-eating, Sonia says she ate the wrong types of food.    Butter was my real weakness. I’d lash it on thick white bread toast in the mornings, or on a bacon sandwich, then on a couple of crusty cobs at lunchtime. I just loved it. As the weigh piled on, Sonia found it more and more dficult to indulge her passion for fashion, despite working at Evans plus-size clothes chain at the time. I went up to a size  so I was really limited to what I could wear – everything was stretchy and elasticated or loose-fitting. I absolutely love clothes, but I became a bit mumsy and just faded into the background. It bothered me but I never said it, I just concentrated on being the best mum I could be and I think I dressed my teenage daughter how I would have loved to dressI could.” Sonia, who lives in Cannock, Staffordshire, says she never shared her feelings about her weigh with anyone and her family never mentioned it.  “My husband just loved me for how I was, whatever size I was, and I’m grateful for that but sometimes I wish he’d turned said ‘you could really do with doing something about your size’ even though I don’t know how I’d have reacted. Since I’ve lost weight he’s told me he’d often hear people snigger or make comments, but he didn’t tell me then because he didn’t want to upset me. With walking even short distances starting to become impossible, Sonia, joined her local Slimming World group in February . “I actually didn’t find it that hard to stick to the meal plans because it was basically the same food, but just cooked in a much healthier way,” she says.  “My mindset totally changed. I thought I loved toast with loads of butter so I never gave anything  a chance, but now I love fresh fruit for breakfast and I’d choose it over toast any day. “I’ll have fruit every morning, or grilled bacon with poached egg and mushrooms at weekends, then I’ll make my own soups for lunch in the winter, and have something like Cajun chicken with salad and veg or pasta for dinner. It’s all the food I like so I’m having it because I enjoy it, not because I’ve got to.” As the weight fell off, Sonia joined a gym for the first time – “I thought they were places fit people went, not people who wanted to get fit,” she admits – and she now goes running three times a week. She reached her target weight a year ago and is now down to just st lb – a loss of st lb. And the -year-old is finally able to shop where she wants and go where she wants.

For example, did you know that % of Brits follow bad practices before bed  Caffeine, booze and use of ­electronic devices are the main offenders, according to a new survey by bed manufacturer Sealy. And of the % of UK adults who have used free public Wi-Fi, more than half have entered passwords and used online banking, leaving them at risk of being hacked. But there is good news – tiny mistakes need just tiny changes to put them right. Here we explore how to correct these common errors... Ban the snooze button  It’s certainly tempting to put the alarm on snooze to grab an extra  minutes. “But by dozing off again, we’re preparing our bodies for another sleep cycle, which is then quickly interrupted – causing us to feel fatigued for the rest of the day,” says Holly Housby, sleep expert at Sealy UK. Unplug your charger Electrical appliances kept plugged in when not in use are a major cause of wasted energy. Phone chargers can cost up to £ a year in unused energy. Wait before mouthwash    “Never swill mouthwash straight after brushing – it just removes the protective fluoride from the toothpaste,” warns Dr Mark Buddha, director at MyClinique Dental. Reduce waste Every year Brits throw away  million eggs and  million pints of milk because of our reliance on best-before dates, according to research by Too Good to Go. Dairy brand Arla is now planning to scrap use-by dates on milk, encouraging customers to snf or taste it instead. You can also try the egg test. A fresh egg will sink to the bottom of a bowl of cold water and lie on its side. Eggs nearing expiration – but still fresh enough to eat – will sink and sit upright. Eggs that aren’t fresh will float. Limit your social sharing Less than half of Brits set their social media profiles to private, says online security firm McAfee. The company’s chief scientist Raj Samani says: “And our research discovered that % of people disclose their location when posting online. Be careful what you post and increase privacy settings to ensure tagged posts are only shared with people you know and trust.”  Lead the way Surgeons warn dog owners not to wrap leads around their fingers or wrist because of the dangers of ­laceration, friction burns, fractures and ligament injuries. Avoid public Wi-Fi    Fake Wi-Fi hotspots allow cybercriminals to ­eavesdrop on users and steal usernames, ­passwords and bank details. They often have innocuous sounding names such as “airport wi-fi” and can redirect victims to malicious malware and phishing sites. Genuine public networks ask the user to agree to the terms and ­conditions of accessing the Wi-Fi so an immediate connection could signal an unsafe connection. Always ensure the web address bar reads HTTPS instead of HTTP and check for a padlock. This means that the data is encrypted. Reduce email time A new study of , office workers found they typically spend around two hours each day browsing their inbox – wasting  work days a year. But each time you stop to read or respond to an email it takes between three and  minutes to get your focus back on to what you were previously doing. Turn off notications and batch-check your emails at allocated times.

However, when the former bank worker became faint she was rushed to the emergency room downstairs in the hospital and was given the diagnosis that she had a urinary tract infection. But her instant relief quickly wore off as Jessica was then told she went into septic shock and began fighting for her le hooked up to two dferent IV lines and enduring brain, liver and kidney scans.    After one week in hospital Jessica ed home and back to work before being struck by the same symptoms again just six months laterand was diagnosed with sepsis again, deriving from another UTI. Jessica then quit her job due to her lack of energy and inability to complete apossimpleapos tasks when she was struck with the deadly infection once more in January . However, after saying goodbye to her family and believing there was no recovering this time, Jessica beat the odds and survived sepsis for the third time. Now, she is sharing her story to encourage people to never brush off their symptoms and to ask doctorsit aposcould be sepsisapos when they are receiving diagnosis. Jessica, from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, said: I had taken my mother to the hospital to receive surgery when I suddenly came over very hot - but I thought it was just menopausal hot flashes.    Then I was sick, but still I thought it would just be my nerves because of my motheraposs surgery, so continued to just sit down fanning myself and waiting for her to be seen. Her nurse noticed that I was sweating and looking unwell and told me to go to the emergency room downstairs, but I didnapost listen until I tried to stand up and fell straight back down. When I went downstairs I gave urine samples, had all sorts of scans and was hooked up to IV drips - and after a while I was told I had a UTI, which gave me instant relief. However, just hours later they told me I had gone into septic shock and for the next week I was still in the hospital fighting for my le.    When I was finally allowed home I hoped it was all over so I ed back to work - but then six months later the same symptoms came over me like a wave and, when I got to hospital, I was diagnosed with sepsis again. Once again, I battled through this sepsis before being diagnosed with it again under a year later. This time I said goodbye to my family because I was certain that I couldnapost be lucky a third time, but somehow I was. Every time it was as a result of a UTI - something which is so common in so many women.  Hopefully from sharing my story people will realise it can be so much deeper than your initial diagnosis and Iaposm encouraging people to push their doctors to askit could be sepsis. Despite surviving the le-threatening condition three times, Jessica admits that she suffers from apospost-sepsis syndromeapos still to this day.

Clashes between police and demonstrators have broken out in Santiago following weeks of unrest over the government’s economic policies, including low salaries and poor healthcare. The violence has seen vandalism, arson attacks and looting in one of Latin America’s richest nations, where there is also anger at the yawning gap between rich and poor. Police have responded by using tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and water cannons against the protesters. Two police officers were engulfed in flames and helped by colleagues who used fire extinguishers and their hands.    The two women, María José Hernández Torres, , and Abigail Catalina Aburto Cardenas, , both members of the Santiago police special forces, are in serious condition in hospital, police said. Chile’s Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel visited the pair in hospital on Monday evening and denounced the attack as “pure violence... nothing to do with the legitimate demands of citizens.” He said: “It was a violent, cowardly aggression against two police officers who were working to protect the safety of our compatriots.”    The two women are among  police officers injured in the demonstrations over the last two weeks, along with , protesters who have been hospitalised, according to human rights groups. Meanwhile, a Chilean prosecutor said today he would seek court approval to investigate  police officers for allegedly torturing protesters during the three weeks of intense unrest and rioting in the country. Manual Guerra, the prosecutor for Santiago East, said the investigation was related to two separate cases during a nine-day state of emergency in the capital Santiago from October .    One related to the actions of  police officers in Nunoa, a bohemian suburb of Santiago, where protestors defied a curfew to conduct successive nights of large but mainly peaceful demonstrations in a central square, a spokesman for Guerra told Reuters without providing further details. The second related to two officers in the lower-middle class area of La Florida who were accused of beating a young man who was handcuffed, the spokesman said. The alleged abuses took place against a backdrop of  days of mass rioting, looting and, more recently, peaceful protests over endemic inequality in one of Latin Americaaposs richest nations.

He said he felt a sharp pain in his right ear while sleeping so his family members shone a torch into his ear canal. They found what appeared to be a large cockroach inside. Ear, nose and throat specialist Zhong Yijin recalled: He said his ear hurt a lot, like something was scratching or crawling inside. It caused a lot of discomfort. I discovered more than ten cockroach babies inside. They were already running around.    The newly hatched nymphs, which were small and lighter in colour than their black and brown mother, were of the German cockroach species Blattella germanica, the hospital said. Doctor Zhong plucked the tiny insects from Mr Lvaposs right ear one by one using a pair of tweezers, before also removing the much larger mother roach. According to the hospital, Mr Lv suffered minor injuries to his right ear canal. He was prescribed with ointment and cream, and discharged on the same day.    The hospitalaposs head of ENT, Li Jinyuan, told local media that Mr Lv had a habit of leaving unfinished food packets near his bed, attracting parasites such as cockRoaches. Female cockroaches carry up to  eggs, reports say. Deputy head of ENT Jiang Tengxiang advised: Household hygiene helps to prevent the appearance and spread of cockroaches.

The announcement comes more than a week after the evil ISIS leader was obliterated and died like a dog during a raid in Syria by U.S. special forces.The hate-filled thug spent his final moments in utter fear, total panic and dread before detonating a suicide vest in a tunnel where he dragged three kids with him. Turkeyaposs President Tayyip Erdogan announced the news earlier today of the weaposs capture, which also comes after other family members of the killer were apprehended.   However, Mr Erdogan appeared to take a swipe at the way the U.S announced Baghdadiaposs death, which was revealed to the world by President Donald Trump during a press conference at the White House. Mr Erdogan said: The United States said Baghdadi killed himself in a tunnel. They started a communication campaign about this. But, I am announcing it here for the first time: We captured his we and didnapost make a fuss like them. Similarly, we also captured his sister and brother in law in Syria.    He gave no further details. A senior Turkish official said that the operation in which Baghdadiaposs we was detained took place on June ,  when Turkish police captured a group of  Islamic State suspects in Turkeyaposs Hatay province. He said one of the four women caught in the operation identied herself as someone  but was in fact Asma Fawzi Muhammad Al-Qubaysi - Baghdadiaposs first we. We discovered her real identity pretty quickly. At that point, she volunteered a lot of information about Baghdadi and the inner workings of ISIS, the official said, adding that the information led to a series of arrests where.  A DNA test confirmed that another suspect was Baghdadiaposs daughter, and the detainees were being held at a deportation centre in Turkey. Earlier this week, a senior Turkish official said Turkey had captured Baghdadiaposs sister, her husband and daughter-in-law. They added that they hoped to gain intelligence from them about Islamic State, although they has not said what knowledge they may have had about the groupaposs operations. Baghdadi rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself caliph of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and Syria from - before Islamic Stateaposs control was wrested away by a U.S.-led coalition.

You can’t say: ‘Don’t worry about it boys, we can just turn up and we’ll get the right calls this time’.“You need to put your stamp on the match and hurt whoever you are playing. They will be thinking the same. The talk will not be about that game. It will be about this match and what it means to us as a club.”The Dens gaffer is in no doubt his side are a “stronger group” this time around.And he points to the quality that’s been added since in the shape of former West Brom, Norwich and Rangers midfielder Graham Dorrans.“I would say we are a stronger group,” James said.“We have added quality to the group. However, United will be stronger, too, because, although they didn’t make wholesale changes, they have been able to work with their players and they have been on a good run.“I think the benefits we have had on the training ground they will have had as well.“They may not have needed as much work but we felt we did need to put in the work on the training field in terms of how we go about things.“I think you can see that and, hopefully, you will see it on Friday night again.”He added: “I still don’t think we are completely there.“I don’t knowI will ever think that. In terms of training and that, then yes.“The international break came at a good time for us because we hadn’t yet had the chance to integrate Graham Dorrans into the squad.“We also had Jamie Ness coming back so it was a really good time to get a week’s training done.“Then we have had the games coming in thick and fast and you can see the benefit of that week.“The boys have been getting to know each other and what’s good and their strengths.“It is tough to just tell them that, you need to work on it day in, day out on the training field. I think even the top teams will tell you that.“Getting a settled squad after the window shut and being able to work with the boys – that has certainly helped us.”Meanwhile, the Dens boss is hopeful left-back Jordan Marshall will be fit to start on Friday after he limped off early in the - win over Morton last week.James said: “He is OK, I think. We left him out of training yesterday but he is gradually getting better. Hopefully, we caught it at the right time.“He did look a bit tired the other night, as did some others. We are asking Jordan and the others to press hard in the game but, hopefully, he will be all right.“The fans have taken to him and I can see why. He is very consistent and has a good end product as well which goes under-rated at times.“We will get him through this week and he will be fine.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c878c0ccea290.07156375-848x564.jpg ","title":"dundee pupils soaring as statistics show schools now out performing edinburgh","story":"Dundee has leapt from the bottom of the school league table and has now overtaken Edinburgh.The performance statistics, released by the Scottish Government, marks a signicant improvement from the previous year when it was revealed the city was the worst-performing area in the country.The  data showed just one in eight secondary schools in the city, St John’s RC High School, achieved results above expectations while six under performed.It also showed two city secondary schools, Baldragon and Braeview academies, were among the  worst performing state school in Scotland – achieving results % lower than expected.But this year’s data, which was originally published by The Times, shows the best performing school in Dundee was Grove Academy, with % of its pupils attaining five Highers or more.Harris Academy came in second, with % achieving five Highers or more, followed by St John’s with % of pupils getting the haul of qualications.One of last year’s worst performing schools, Braeview Academy, experienced an increase in the number of pupils achieving five or more Highers, rising from % to %.However, Baldragon Academy experienced a slight decrease, with levels falling from % in  to % this year.Education convener Stewart Hunter said he was “pleased” with the improvements while recognising there was still more work to be done.He added: “A signicant effort has been made in the last year to improve year-on-year.“Last year’s figures weren’t good despite overall performance in schools over the last  years.

before an accident at work changed his le in .Fast-forward four years – and the former road worker contemplates taking his own le every single day.A visibly distressed Scott today revealed he has dealt with a tumultuous few years that have transformed his le.The death of his sister Jennie Cameron was among a number of family losses in a short period of time.Her brave battle against cancer was documented in the Eveningbefore she died on the day she was due to be married in September .Scott was admitted to Carseview the following month after attempting to take his own le.Now the former St Saviour’s High pupil is urging for greater aftercare support for those struggling with mental health issues.He said: “Since I had an accident at work it has sort of spiralled from there.“From being a man who used to work to support his family to being like this is incredibly hard to take.“I was in Carseview on two separate occasions the month that I attempted to take my own le.“I still have suicidal thoughts daily.”His fiancée, Cheryl, had to become his carer as the family attempted to rebuild their le in Brechin.An unfortunate brush with the law had seen Scott appear in court earlier this year.The police found a haul of antique knives in his car on Fairbairn Street.Dundee Sherf Court heard Scott was encouraged to start collecting knives by his mental health nurses when he was staying at the Carseview Centre.Scott added: “I had just bought the antique knives that day.“It was a case of wrong place, wrong time, after dropping off a family friend.“That pending court case didn’t help with my on-going issues.”Scott had hoped with the support of the community mental health team he could get his le back on track in Angus.He admitted a lack of regular support had seen his progress “stall”.He added: “Whether its a lack of funding or overworked staff, I believe there are failings in the system.“I know of others who are in a similar position to me who feel they can’t get the help they need.“There are massive gaps in the system.”Scott said he wanted to tell his story so that people could be more aware that mental health issues “don’t just go away”.He added: “Despite leaving Carseview my mental health issues didn’t stop the day I left that door.“It is an ongoing struggle and you need those support measures in place.“I want to get the help to turn this around.“Although we have things like Mental Health Awareness Week I believe there is still a lack of understanding of the struggles people face.”A spokeswoman for Angus Health and Social Care Partnership said, “Multidisciplinary community mental health teams are available in every town in Angus.These teams include nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists and allied health professionals.“Community Mental Health Teams also commission third sector services to deliver care in the home and the community

Considine understands more than most the benefits Aberdeen’s new, state-of-the-art training complex at Kingsford will provide.The training facilities, youth academy and community hub at Cormack Park were opened by the Dons’ greatest manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, last Thursday.While the first team will benefit from the new £ million-plus facilities to the west of the Granite City, Considine is also considering the next generation.The defender – a Pittodrie youth academy graduate – knows those trying to follow the same path into the first team will benefit from having a training base rather than training and playing in ious locations across Aberdeen.Considine, , recalls being ferried around the city as a youth player and then having to assemble the goalposts in the snow before they began training.Although the move to Kingsford doesn’t guarantee better weather, the new facilities will be a welcome change.Considine said: “It has been spoken about for a long time. I remember there used to be this -seater red bus that Drew Jarvie would drive to take us out to the barracks for training.“In the winter you’d be getting on and off the bus in the snow and having to build the goals and things like that.“We’ll still get rain and snow at Westhill, but at least we won’t have to build the goals.”Considine also believes having the training facilities at Kingsford will give Derek McInnes’ first team more time to hone their skills.Currently, time constraints can be a factor in how much additional work can be done after training.McInnes has spoken previously about training at places like Aberdeen Sports Village and Spain Park, where they are only able to hire pitches for a set period of time.Now that the training ground has been completed, the Dons won’t have that problem.And Considine says it’s little things like this that make a big dference.He added: “I understand the dference it can make – you can do extra work before and after training.“Don’t get me wrong, right now Tony Docherty will take strikers to do a bit and boys will do stuff themselves at the end of training.“But then you’re on a bus for  or  minutes, back to the stadium.“It’s the same before – you do your prehab to warm up and then you go on a bus and you’re stf again and have to do a bit more when you get to training.“That might not seem like much, but it’s the little things that make a dference.“These facilities will all help, which will be fantastic.”Considine believes proper training facilities are something Aberdeen have needed for a long time.Having a training ground and also a new stadium is something that has been mooted for many years.But to finally see it delivered is something that Considine and all his colleagues are thrilled about.The first-team squad trained at Kingsford for the first time last Friday, before Saturday’s - Pittodrie victory against Kilmarnock.He said: “The players are all looking forward to it.“I’ve been here  or  years and it’s been a long time coming. But I’m absolutely delighted to get into the new facility.“It’s what the club have been needing for a very long time.“It won’t just be great for the first team, it will be great for all the youth teams as well to have the facility.“If you have everyone together it makes it feel like even more of a family club.“Having this gives everyone from youth teams to first team the opportunity to do more training and practise more.“Everything will become easier for us.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/police-2-136x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small

is to go before the education operational delivery committee next week, stated: “Education Scotland and the Care Inspectorate ed to Orchard Brae to check progress in September.“The Care Inspectorate completed a fullinspection.“The organisation noted that all the requirements and recommendations had been met and the evaluations have signicantly improved.”The new inspection rated the quality of

unauthorised pupil absences.The change would also bring the holidays in line with  other Scottish local authorities.The report states: “When asked the question, ‘Do you agree the school summer holidays should be moved forward by one week ’, the majority of children and young peoplewere keen to keep the current arrangements and make no change to the summer holiday pattern.“Only % expressed a desire to move the holiday pattern and % didn’t express a preference.”It adds: “A summary of responses suggests that there is no appetite to change the timing of the school holiday pattern and this

years.”"},{"url":"//www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/11/5dbfb5b6a79f02.08642347-821x564.jpg ","title":"gift of an art gallery given back to aberdeen public","story":"Aberdeen

released in September, with more than , members of the public booking places for the opening two days.The council’s culture spokeswoman Marie Boulton said: “It’s not the council’s gallery, it’s everyone’s gallery.“I think people will come in and get that familiar hug of things they will recognise, from the granite pillars to the Cowdray Hall to the Memorial Hall.“Then they’ll look up and they’ll get this amazing sense of excitement that will run through them when they see the floor we have added, the beautul features that are around and the amazing collections now being exhibited.“I’m

including the lovely coffee shop.“There is something for everyone and I just hope the people of Aberdeen feel we have done justice not just to the building but absolutely celebrate all the new

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s. Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

With Mondays five matches delivering only one win it was a rather downbeat team who gathered for the team meeting that night.Stuart #The Forest# Johnston couldn#t see the wood for the trees, The Sneddon couldn#t see the goal for the hanky protecting his head from the sun, Iain #Caravan# MacDonald was thinking too much about camper vans, whilst Tom #The Gin# Kilcolm didn#t live up to his name and went nearly tea total.Captain Anderson though delivered when it mattered. With Colin #The Cat# in goal, Sneddon was deployed at the back alongside. MacDonald, Johnston and Kilcolm were pushed further forward with the captain and #The Scribe# Litster in midfield. As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam. Victory was secured and Captain Anderson#s coat was no longer on that shoogly peg.Ex Liverpool legends John Aldridge and Alan Kennedy were on hand to present the trophy. Thanks were extended at the after match banquet to the organisers, Lagos Strollers Walking Football Club for an excellent tournament and to all the players for their sporting attitude throughout the matches.Remember Lochgilphead walking football takes place every Tuesday at the sports centre, .-.pm.

This was followed by Debussy#s Premiere Rhapsodie which was written as a test piece for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire this requires of the performer the full range of colour and technique which was deftly delivered. Finally we were given Poulenc#s last Sonata. In this, and many of his works, he was rebelling against the Impressionist style and was particularly reflected in the outer fast movements with often angular and zany writing.The second half of the programme started with the Saints-Saens#s Sonata # also his last work. Unlike Poulenc, here he was harping back to the th century#s more classical style style of composition.Their official programme ended with a highly-virtuosic rendition of Chausson#s Andante and Allegro, but we were also given a short and charming encore # one of Gerald Finzi#s three pieces for clarinet and piano.This was all chamber music of the highest quality Maximiliano#s musicality, technique, emotional expression and tonal range were exemplary as indeed were those of his accompanist, Scott. It was patently obvious from their opening bars that they had played many times together with the rapport between them a delight to witness.

It will include a new toilet, shower, laundry and kitchen building,  new camping pitches and  motor home pitches, most of which will have hook-ups.The total project will cost around £,. In addition to HIE’s contribution will be an award of £, from the Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund, with the balance from IGHT.It is expected that the modern site will strengthen the local economy by an additional £, a year and that other businesses on Gigha will benefit from the increase in footfall and visitor spend.The Isle of Gigha camp and motorhome site is due to welcome its first visitors in autumn , after which it will be open throughout the year.Strategic planning to secure a strong, sustainable future for the Mount Stuart Trust and the Isle of Bute is at an advanced stage, with key decisions expected by spring .Speaking ahead of the next phase of community consultations, Colin Boag, managing director of Mount Stuart Trust, said: #We are working intensively with community groups, Argyll and Bute Council and the Scottish Land Commission to develop a range of initiatives to improve the rural and urban landscapes on the island of Bute and to unlock growth opportunities for the local economy.#There is a great sense of purpose and commitment from everyone involved. This is matched by a desire to make progress on a number of crucial projects. The trust will conclude a strategic review by the end of the year. In conducting this - year ‘look forward’, we have been well supported through discussions with iniduals and community bodies across the island.#As part of the overall review, we are creating a specic rural strategy focussed on building a sound, sustainable future for farming and forestry on the island. Following an initial consultation with key stakeholders in July, we are developing the rural strategy through a number of joint working groups. These are examining key priorities including dairy farming, rural training and skills, forestry development and the environment.#Our emerging rural strategy builds on work completed with Argyll and Bute Council to support their bid to the Scottish and UK governments for a multi-million-pound Rural Growth Deal. Working together with the council, Fyne Futures and the Bute Island Alliance, we drew up a proposal for investment of £million to pilot on Bute a new transformative rural development model for niche food and drink and primary island industries.The trust is also consulting with local communities about the proposals to release urban land for community projects. This important work is being conducted in line with the Scottish Land Commission’s protocol on community engagement.In August, Mount Stuart Trust, with Scottish Land Commission representatives, held an urban community workshop with key community organisations in Rothesay. Discussion centred on how potential community projects could utilise land in Rothesay, which is currently in either council or trust ownership.Colin Boag added: #Throughout the discussions with ious community representatives, a number of local groups have expressed interest to make use of some or all of the land on offer. We welcome their interest in creating opportunities for positive change on the Isle of Bute.#I am confident that the depth of collaboration between Argyll and Bute Council, the Land Commission, local communities and the trust is set bring a strong sense of renewal and confidence to the island.#It was a trip to the Co-op and trollies at the ready for Lochgilphead High School pupils, as they were set a mission in aid of the Argyll Foodbank.Staff from the school ided the group of S pupils into teams, giving each an inidual budget to stick to.

Pumpkins, grown by the school#s science department, have been purchased by staff in preparation for the carving event that will take place next week. The money raised from this was then matched by school funds to give an overall budget of £.Over  items were purchased by the pupils on Thursday October , using their Young Scot cards to benefit from a  per cent discount and remembering to collect valuable points on their Co-op membership cards.The school has decided to make contributions to the food bank throughout the year, particularly focusing on Easter, Halloween and Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries november 1 2019","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNumbers drawn in Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery on Monday October  were ,  and .

Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"cairndows getting connected by community effort","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe end is almost in sight for a path connecting Cairndow around the head of Loch Fyne.Phase one of the path project # between the Tree Shop at Clachan and Achadunan # is already complete, but the much longer stretch between Achadunan and Cairndow village is currently being built, high above the A trunk road.Contractors have been employed to do the bulk of the work, thanks to grant funding, but  volunteers have been involved in what has become a real community effort.When complete, the five foot wide path, with a firm surface suitable for walking or cycling, will feature  bridges crossing burns and will have a specially designed crossing at the A above Cairndow village.The project, part of the Cairndow Action Plan, is on track for completion by the end of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"mod success stories from across argyll","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEight-year-old Emma Litster from Lochgilphead competed in the Highland dancing competition on Thursday October , held at the at the Gaelic College.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

Despite signicant effort over the last  months, it has not been possible to conclude the sale of the Campbeltown Creamery.When it became clear that a sale to a third party was unlikely, the local Kintyre farmers launched a plan to take over the creamery. Despite considerable work to find a way to take the business forward, especially from their steering group, advisers, the Scottish Government and staff at Campbeltown Creamery, they have not been able to find a financially viable long-term business plan for the creamery.Commenting on the announcement, Shelagh Hancock, chief executive, said: #We are disappointed that it has not been possible to conclude a sale of Campbeltown Creamery. We fully appreciate that this decision has signicant consequences for colleagues at the creamery and the local community, but it is important that we act in the best interest of the wider business and our farmer members and continue with the solid progress we have made in strengthening and developing First Milk.#We regret the impact this decision will have on our colleagues and are committed to treating those affected fairly and with consideration during this dficult time.#Throughout the last  months we have been in regular dialogue with our local members on Kintyre about the future of the site. Nothing will change in respect to their co-operative membership of First Milk, and we will continue to collect and pay for their milk on the same basis as before.#James Barbour, chairman of the Kintyre steering group, added: #It was the right thing to investigate all avenues to seewe could keep the creamery open in Kintyre.

That is due to the harsh, economic reality of processing milk in an incredibly tough dairy industry that has witnessed so many casualties at both farm and processing level in recent times.#While this is very disappointing news, it is reassuring that all of the local farmers are members of First Milk and will continue to benefit from being part of a national co-operative with an evergreen contract and continuing to have their milk collected in the future.#"},{"url":null,"title":"harvest party reaps food bank donations","story":"At the group#s harvest party on Wednesday morning, each child, dressed in ious costumes, some spooky and some sweet, brought an item to donate to the food bank.Kintyre Toy Library meets every Monday and Wednesday from .am to .am, and on Thursdays from -pm, during term-time, in Springbank Evangelical Church Hall.For £ entry, children up to school age enjoy a range of arts and crafts, as well as songs and stories."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 1 2019","story":"It is devastating news for the Kintyre economy that one of the area#s biggest employers looks set to lose up to  per cent of its workforce.It must be devastating news for all CS Wind UK#s staff, with the uncertainty surrounding jobs made all the worse in the lead up to Christmas.The company#s next potential order is due for production in , so there is a future for the factory and we are sure the company is doing all it can to secure that future.Our fingers are crossed that the talks with Argyll and Bute Council, the Scottish and Westminster governments and other organisations are successful in finding a solution to the shortfall in orders.By chance, the news of redundancies at CS Wind came the same week as Amazon revealed its power purchase agreement with a Kintyre wind farm.Attempts by the Courier to confirm the location of the wind farm were unsuccessful but,it comes to fruition, it is to be hoped it will bring jobs to the area."},{"url":null,"title":"springbank and machrihanish help graces pals raise cash","story":"Two nights’ accommodation, a VIP tour and tasting at Springbank Distillery, and a round of golf for eight people at Machrihanish Golf Club were the star lot at an auction in aid of the charity.This was part of an event held by Blairmains Farm Shop and Coffee Bothy in Blairlogie, near Stirling, run by the Logan family and Meg Filshie, who are friends of Kintyre#s David Allen.David and his we Cynthia moved to Campbeltown just over six years ago when David joined Springbank#s sales team.

under way at the site, near the A, ahead of the eye-catching piece of artwork being put in place.Original proposals suggested Apollo, the Greek and Roman god of the sun, could find a home on the Spott roundabout on the busy road.However, it was eventually decided that a bear, designed by renowned Scottish artist Andy Scott, would be created on land near the townrsquos Asda store and McDonaldrsquos restaurant, east of the roundabout.The sculpture will stand on top of a mound of earth.Ken Ross, from Hallhill Development Ltd, which is behind the proposals, told the Courier work was under way, with

Aberdeenrsquos Marischal Square.Work was delayed slightly to allow the re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar to take place last month.The sculpture, which is made of welded steel and fabricated from steel plates of ious thicknesses, is a nod towards John Muir, who was born in the town before emigrating to the USA and playing a key role in the formation of the countryrsquos national park system.Planning permission for the sculpture was originally turned down by East Lothian Council after concerns were raised that the work of art would be a distraction to drivers on the A.The decision was appealed to the local authorityrsquos local review body, where Dunbar and East Linton ward member Sue Kempson said: ldquoI find the links with John Muir extremely tenuous and I donrsquot find it particularly attractive.However, ward colleague Councillor Norman Hampshire was backed by the committeersquos other two members ndash Jeremy Findlay and Stuart Currie ndash in backing the plans, which were then given final approval by the Scottish Government, with conditions from Transport Scotland.Discussions surrounding the sculpture have been ongoing for more than two years, with the plans splitting the townrsquos community council when they were discussed.Pippa Swan, now chairwoman of the group, originally said: ldquoFor me it is a bizarre proposal and it looks like a polar bear or like an advertisement for a safari park.Fellow community councillor Herbert Coutts was more positive and pointed to the impact of the Kelpies and the Angel of the North, near Gateshead.He said: ldquoI know at the time the Kelpies were being proposed there was a lot of opposition to that but now they are being recognised as being icons for Scotland.ldquoI drive along that road very regularly and

had seen the number of visits to that library service almost halved.And it added: ldquoAlthough we have improved facilities within the school, there is no public transport to the school and limited car parking so some of our elderly customers are not now using the library.However, the report said there were hopes that when the new housing had been completed at Wallyford, where large development

library and customer services, increasing digital use and dferent types of events taking place within libraries.It said that the number of e-magazines and e-newspapers issued through the library

The River Esk snakes around the edge of the course.Prof Crofts expressed concern that dogs could easily swallow them, resulting in ldquolarge vet bills for owners.After ing the balls to the club, he has issued a call for the flood protection scheme, currently being drawn up for Musselburgh, to include measures to slow down water coming off the Pentland and Moorfoot Hills where the North and South Esk rise.Prof Crofts, of Musselburghrsquos Eskside West, a geography expert who has worked as a research scientist in Scotland, said: ldquoAlong the golf course there are very soft banks and you can see where they have been cut back, and probably there was some rough at the end of the fairway where lots of people have lost balls.ldquoWe cannot stop leaves and tree trunks being brought down the river but the speed of rise of the water level and its velocity shows that any flood prevention scheme for Musselburgh needs to look hard at measures to slow down water coming off the hills and into the river. Without this, the erection of walls being proposed in Musselburgh will not be public money well spent.ldquoMany of us feel the importance of the amenity of this stretch of the river ndash it is very fine.He said a tree planting scheme using native species should be discussed with landowners in the headwaters of the Esk catchment area, as government grants were available for such work.He said: ldquoI am talking about hundreds of thousands of trees maybe. Careful hand planting of trees is best rather than using tractors to dig ditches to prepare the land for planting as this would aggravate the problem by increasing the rate of water running off the hills. The trees would take up water from the soil.ldquoThe use of the reservoirs on the North and South Esk and the temporary flooding of the flat land along the river should be seriously investigated to store water during heavy rainfall and therefore slow the release of water into the river.ldquoIf you look at the flood issue, itrsquos caused by the river rising very fast but itrsquos made worsethere are high spring tides and a storm surge in the North Sea, and also a northerly wind across the estuary which piles the water up high and stops the river water escaping for a couple of hours either side of high tide.Professor Crofts has raised his concerns with consultants who are drawing up the Musselburgh Flood Protection Scheme and he has also made local councillors aware of his views.As for the coast, he highlighted small sand dunes which formed a natural barrier with grasses, which, below the ground level, had yards of roots acting as a natural catcher of the sand.Jackie Lambert, captain of Musselburgh Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was unaware of the issue regarding golf balls being found on the beach near the mouth of the River Esk.ldquoWhilst, the figure of  golf balls is signicant, it is unknown over what timescale these balls have accumulated andthey are all, indeed, from the course.ldquoNotwithstanding this, the golf club will happily participate in any working group looking at the wider issues of flood protection and the environment in and around Musselburgh.

When they got there they laid a chequered blanket down on the grass, opened their basket and began to eat.They were about to leave after eating their food when they saw a robin perched on a nearby branch. It seemed friendly and the children fed the wee bird some of their leftovers.The robin then flew to a nearby abandoned cottage. The children were intrigued and followed the robin to investigate the cottage.They couldnrsquot remember noticing it before and they were wandering around it peering inside through small a gap in the wall. They couldnrsquot see where the robin had gone. They should have just left it but curiosity got the better of them and they searched for a way in. They were anxious to find out what had happened to the robin.But there was no way in, as the entrance and windows were blocked. So they clambered up the cottage wall, the bricks crumbling under their feet.Tired and exhausted, they finally reached where they thought the robin had landed.They found an opening which led to a dark passage. Despite being a bit scared, Max and Lily decided to investigate and walked down the passage. It was dimly lit by small gaps in the wall that let in narrow beams of light. At the end, there was a staircase. They huddled together as they walked.Then all of a sudden, the floorboard behind them collapsed.Now in fear and panic, they dashed up the steps of the dilapidated staircase into the attic.From the corner of the attic, they could just make out a small black figure running towards them.They thought they had seen the robin but it was something much worse. ldquoMouse! screamed Lily. Then they heard a glass shatter ndash smash!They were now terried and they sat in pitch darkness. The only light they had was the light that was seeping through the bricks in the walls.As they sat in fear, they realised they needed to come up with a plan to escape. They searched the cottage for a way out.As Lily investigated around the room, she tripped over a rug that seemed to have something poking upwards. She called out for Max and he came rushing down the stairs.As Max kneeled down to take a closer look, Lily revealed what looked like a trapdoor.Astonished, the children pulled the handle.It led to a tunnel which was flooded with candlelight. Who lit the candles  Max and Lily wonderedwhoever had lit the candles knew they were there.They entered the candlelit tunnel and one step at a time they cautiously moved forward.Then, slam! The trapdoor shut behind them and they jumped in fear. This was all too much for them to handle, they were desperate to get out.Then Max heard a soft but evil whisper: ldquoPlease stay, Irsquom lonely.In terror, he pulled out his phone and pressed  but it instantly shut off. ldquoPlease stay, said the voice, now sounding child-like.ldquoHelp! screamed Max and Lily through the gaps in the wall, but help never came.Then they heard something on the floorboards above.ldquoThere must be something up there, said Lily. ldquoI guess the only way out is to follow the candlelight.So they ventured further down the candlelit passageway.As the pair made their way through the tunnel, they could just make out what looked like a white figure approaching, who had a terrying grin with sharp teeth.Max and Lilyrsquos hearts beat uncontrollably as they sprinted away from this terrying image and as they did so all the candles blew out, throwing the children into complete darkness.Was this thing still there  The friends sat together in the darkness breathing heavily, in shock and terror.Suddenly, in the darkness, icy fingers gripped Lilyrsquos arms.ldquoWas that you rsquorsquo asked Lily. ldquoNo, replied Max.All at once, the candles lit up again. Max and Lily turned round and saw a horrying face: ldquoArghhhhhhh!They woke in the sunlight. ldquoWhat  said Max, confused. ldquoWhat just happened   added Lily.ldquoIt must have been a bad dream, said Max. ldquoBut both of us had the same dream, how is that possible ldquoWe had better go, they said.As they were about to leave, they saw a robin. They turned and looked at each other with a smirk on their faces and a chill in their bones."},{"url":null,"title":"port-seton-library-closing-refurbishment","story":"The library, situated within the Port Seton Community Centre, closes on Monday and will re-open on Monday, December .During this period, customers will not be able to borrow books or other loans however, they canany loans to staff at the community centre and the outstanding loans period will be extended during the refurbishment work.Anyone wishing to use a computer will be able to do so within the community centre.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, council spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: ldquoOur investment in the refurbishment of the library will result in it being repainted and the carpeting being replaced, which means that it has to be completely emptied for the work to be carried out.\"Loans can still be taken out or ed at any of the other branches across East Lothian and we have made sure that two PCs will be available to use within the community centre."},{"url":null,"title":"pumpkin-patch-nursery-boss-admits-defeat-closing-dunbar-nursery","story":"Jonathan Bruneau said the Dunbar branch of his Pumpkin Patch Nurseries would close permanently in two weeks after  years of looking after children in the town.The nursery was criticised in a recent Care Inspectorate report over changing staff and a lack of management.However, Mr Bruneau, who also has Pumpkin Patch nurseries in North Berwick and Haddington, said the problems had been created by Scottish Government demands.He said: ldquoUnfortunately we have had to admit defeat related to our ability to staff and manage our Dunbar setting.ldquoRecruiting management and senior staff has been impossible over recent years due to Scottish Government policies which have driven the average age and experience of nursery practitioners down to levels which are simply not appropriate to run a nursery.ldquoNursery staff work long hours for salaries which are not commensurate with the level of education and expertise they are expected to achieve.ldquoThis, plus the rolling out of , hours per year of free nursery care , has created a staffing crisis most noticeably felt in rural areas where staff cannot afford to travel from Edinburgh or beyond.ldquoThe final straw came when we lost our most recent manager after three months when she was poached by a nursery closer to home. This was inevitable as she had been travelling one hour each way to get to Dunbar and, even though subsidised by us to make the journey, a two-hour commute is simply not sustainable.Mr Bruneau warned of the impact of demands on private nurseries in April this year when his nursery in Haddington saw its grades fall in an inspection. He said: ldquoThis is a systematic problem which is causing a death spiral in the quality of nursery provision throughout the industry.The inspection report on Dunbarrsquos Pumpkin Patch rated its quality of care and support, staffing and management and leadership at twowith the environment rated a three .The report said that parents had contacted the inspectorate following its unannounced visit in August to discuss concerns.A high turnover in staff was raised by a number of parents, with one telling inspectors: ldquoOften when I drop my child off I have to introduce myself and my child to the agency staff.The report said: ldquoParents told us that they often did not know the staff when they dropped off their children in the morning, often resulting in their children being reluctant to attend.Mr Bruneau said that the introduction of mandatory SSSCregistration was creating recruitment problems throughout the industry.He said: ldquoBefore the advent of SSSC registration, our group of nurseries never used any agency staff as recruitment was simple. It included people of ying ages, experience and circumstance.ldquoIt was a healthy labour market now new staff are iniably under , inexperienced in le, work and certainly the care of children.ldquoNursery closures are inevitable as sites struggle to find staff, maintain standards and satisfy increased demand.He said his company had decided to rationalise itsservices, placing more experience in fewer sites, and called on the Scottish Government to reverse policies he said ruled out more mature staff from working in nurseries.He added that all five members of staff at Dunbar had been offered places at his other nurseries.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council, which used the Dunbar nursery as a partner provider, said: ldquoWe have worked with Pumpkin Patch as one of our partner providers, offering funded early learning and childcare for pre-school children for many years.ldquoOur officers have also provided extensive support to the Dunbar team to help them improve the quality of experiences following recent Care Inspectorate reports. Our assistance has been recognised and appreciated by the owners, who feel that we have done all we can to support them.ldquoWe acknowledge that this will have been a dficult decision for the owners and will have implications for their team at Dunbar. We also acknowledge the upset and disruption that the nursery closure will bring for parents using this service.ldquoOur staff will work with and support parents to find alternative early learning and childcare within the area that meets their needs.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoMore than , children are already benefiting from the expanded entitlement after we increased training opportunities and routes into the early learning and childcare sector, resulting in a record ,-strong workforce.ldquoWe are working alongside local authorities and providers to ensure the necessary workforce is in place ndash including running a national early learning and childcare recruitment campaign, increasing support for training places and modern apprenticeships, and enabling providers to advertise jobs free on the MyJobScotland website."},{"url":null,"title":"pensioner-completes-74-year-quest-discover-father","story":"David Simpson had spent  years looking for his dad after growing up in a Quarriers orphanage to the west of Glasgow before moving across the Atlantic.But his attempts proved fruitless until a visit to long-lost family in Elgin last year.John Hamilton, from Lost Haddington, then became aware of Mr Simpsonrsquos quest.He said: ldquoFrom the information David received from Quarriers, all he knew was that his father was a Jack Cunningham, a plasterer from Goodallrsquos Place in Haddington.ldquoHis niece AnnMarie Whyte did a search for Goodallrsquos Place and the result came back with a find against a Lost Haddington image for the old Goodallrsquos shop on the townrsquos Bridge Street this led to AnnMarie posting a question askingI knew who Jack Cunningham was.ldquoA search of the Lost Haddington collection for Cunningham brought back too many matches, so the search was honed to lsquoplastererrsquo and the results produced the equivalent of a Holy Grail image ndash a George Angus scan of a lsquoJohnrsquo Cunninghamrsquos security application to RAF East Fortune.As well as correcting the name, the image confirmed his occupation and address, as well as his height, hair and eye colour.A plea was put on social media for further information, which found that Johnrsquos nickname was lsquoGibbyrsquo and that David had a cousin living in Musselburgh called Janette Brotherstone.Mr Hamilton said: ldquoAlso, a further search of Lost Haddington for the word lsquoGibbyrsquo, with it being an unusual name, produced another George Angus image from  showing Davidrsquos father John when he was only five or six years old holding the date plate for his school photo ndash George had annotated the image saying the lsquoboy holding the date slate was Gibby Cunninghamrsquo, so when I sent David this image it was the first time hersquod seen his father.ldquoThe feedback from the Lost Haddington followers also indicated that John died in  when he lived at No  St Annrsquos Place.ldquoThrough the invaluable feedback which named Janette as his first cousin, David was put in touch with her and shersquos since sent him some old family photos showing his father throughout his le.ldquoThe photos came from Davidrsquos fatherrsquos home, where he died, as it was Janette who dealt with the death notices for both Davidrsquos father and Johnrsquos we Jessie Cagder.ldquoDavid visited Scotland in autumn  so I offered to bring him to Haddington, which he accepted.From there, David, who now lives in Rochester, New York, was able to see the home where his dad was born on Haddingtonrsquos St Martinrsquos Gate, as well as his homes on Goodallrsquos Place and St Annrsquos Place.It is thought Davidrsquos dad was lodged with a landlady while working in Elgin in .According to Mr Hamilton: ldquoThe landladyrsquos husband was away from home for two years as a soldier in World War Two and itrsquos during this period that John and the landlady must have had a moment of indiscretion together, which produced David!ldquoWhen the landladyrsquos husband ed home from the war due to injury and found his we holding baby David ndash that couldnrsquot have been his ndash he gave his we the ultimatum: lsquoTake him to the orphanage or itrsquos a orce.rsquoldquoAt the age of around one month old, David was taken to the Quarriers orphanage which is near the Bridge of Weir to the west of Glasgow.David left Quarriers at the age of  and eventually moved to Winnipeg in Canada in  before eventually settling in New York.More than  years ago, he began his bid to track down his family.

Originally coined some years ago by older campaigners wishing for a more sustainable, secure and resilient system of food production and distribution, the -year-old Scot is taking up the baton ndash albeit it on a tiny Perthshire footprint.Four years ago, at the age of , the Dunkeld-born student became the youngest-ever finalist in the long-running reality baking show The Great British Bake-Off [GBBO]. Watched by  million viewers worldwide, she was the runner-up in the  finale and instantly became a media darling. Evidently thrilled and reassured in equal measure to have such a young woman embrace ndash in her reassuring mid-Scots accent ndash the ancient culinary art of baking using centuries-old techniques, print and broadcast commissioning editors flocked to her oven door. Her first cookbook was published, and her online presence rose faster than the lightest souffle. Here was a new domestic goddess in whose delicate hands baking was safe. The world, it seemed, was her ice-cream oyster.Then she turned the tables. Eschewing the bright lights, she has settled instead for her own tiny craft bakery in a th century village in rural Perthshire where she quietly and happily puts in a -hour day. Itrsquos from this modest ndashinfinitely pretty ndash base that she hopes to influence our relationship with food for the better.Not that shersquos about to disappear completely: with its white-painted -year-old stone walls, original black range, front door draped with garlands of dried flowers, the setting for her glass-fronted display of fresh craft bakery items, Aran, is the last word in Instagrammability. Named after the Gaelic for bread, it is also the title of her second cookbook.ldquoYeah, it was a bit of a ballsy move, she agrees of her snap decision to buy the bakery in . ldquoItrsquos been wonderful. I call it my flour oasis. Wersquore perched on little white-painted stepping stools in a corner of the busy shop floor, trying not to get in the way of the constant stream of customers ndash a combination of locals and tourists ndash looking for her trademark homemade croissants, cakes, pastries and sourdough breads which have sustainability hard-baked into every bite.Shedden put her studies on hold ndash she was doing a history of art degree at St Andrews ndash to set up Aran with her friend Angus and her boyfriend of just five months at the time, James Irvine, who now manages the Birnam Arts Centre. The pair live together in the flat above the shop. A crowdfunding campaign raised pound, for refurbishment and grants from the SSE windfarm community fund, combined with a bank loan and proceeds from her first book Gatherings, made her long-held dream possible.ldquoIrsquod immediately become jealous when Angus told me he had a lsquobread shedrsquo, a place where he would create loaves upon loaves post-work and early in the morning, she says. ldquoHis magic little set-up was exactly what I had been looking for. It took a year for the trio and other family and friends to get the bakery open.I remark on how busy Aran is, and am informed it does some  transactions a day . The elongated Scottish tourist season means they are busy all year round rather than the traditional Easter to September.ldquoPeople have no idea how much work goes into this and how much we bake every single day, she says. A production kitchen on a small industrial park up the road in Birnam has helped alleviate the flow.So far, so impressive.But Irsquom intrigued.Alongside gorgeous recipes on how to make the goodies in the bakery ndash think Whisky Eccles cakes, pistachio and lime loaf, or butternut squash and Birnam honey loafndash her new book features little drop-in biogs of her regular customers and staff, many of them men, and also of her father. So the female vibe of her previous book, in which she praised the influence of women on home cooking, seems to have morphed into something more collegiate and collaborative ndash as well as less sugary-sweet. Aran follows a day in the le of the bakery, hour by hour and ritual by ritual, and there are recipes for sandwiches, salads, savoury tarts and sandwiches ndash and a heavy emphasis on sourdough breads, brioches and croissants.So, does running a bakery span the genders  ldquoYeah, it used to be all women but the balance is more even now. In fact, I call my team lsquoThe Boysrsquo, she says. ldquoGatherings was more focused on home and family whereas this is much bigger and wider in scope and people. What wersquore doing here is definitely more collaborative. People of both genders bring in ideas and suggestions, either orally or from memory, and we try them out. Wersquore doing continual RD and things are developing organically. And in the village, the wider community spirit is strong.She makes a point of sourcing ingredients, including the all-important flour, from the community and from Scotland as much as possible. Salmon is from the Dunkeld Smoke House, honey from master beekeeper John Taylor, and fresh produce is from the organic Dunkeld and Birnam Community Growing, known as The Field, and from Blackhall Farm. Butter is from Grahamrsquos Dairies, although her Lescure patisserie butter ndash good for croissants and pastries due to its high fat content ndash is from France. With Brexit in mind, she is looking for alternative local sources to provide her with the  kilos she goes through every week.ldquoThe really important thing for us is to be sustainable, she says.Her message about eating sensibly is also strong, and she cites the Rome-based food writer Rachel Roddy and the Irish writer Diana Henry as her food heroes for their ldquosensible approach to healthy eating.In Aran, she writes: ldquoSugar gets a bad rep, as does gluten, sadly. But my principles remain the same throughout this bizarre time. Use proper and honest ingredients and think of food as a source of fuel and satisfaction, not as something to fear or discuss negatively.Kale, which she says, ldquogets all the attention by the clean-eaters, and I worry it will put people off it, features strongly in her salad section alongside squash, carrot tops, heirloom tomatoes and asparagus. Therersquos a foraged nettle and pea quiche in a nod to Scottish culinary history and nettle pudding, ldquothe oldest recorded pudding in the book, but unlikely to make a reappearance.Her misgivings echo those expressed in the  Gatherings, in which she lamented the number of people of her age-group that she knew to have eating disorders or troubled relationships with food, and how ldquoearth-shattering that could be.The equal balance between sweet and savoury in Aran is notable, and again echoes the authorrsquos desire to change perceptions that baking is all about sweetness and stodge.Does she think her peer-group ndash at almost  she is somewhere between a Millennial and the younger so-called Generation Z ndash are confused about food and diet  ldquoYes, she replies, without hesitation. ldquoI am from the generation with arguably the most delusional approach to food. Therersquos so much noise surrounding it on social media. The influencer set are hugely to blame when it comes to diet issues. People arenrsquot sure about where they stand as they receive mixed messages almost every day.With veganism gaining in popularity among Gen Zedders, does she offer vegan options  ldquoA couple, but thatrsquos not something we do massively, she replies, with an almost imperceptible sigh. ldquoApart from the fact that itrsquos very hard to cater for every possible dietary requirement, our ethos here is hugely based on local, as opposed to dietary.ldquoTherersquos quite a contentious discourse about veganism. I think itrsquos doing more damage to the planet than eating dairy from the farm  miles down the road.\"As well as her concerns about food miles, she also has health worries. ldquoI think itrsquos crazy to eliminate so many food groups at once, as veganism advocates. Itrsquos about cutting out a huge amount of the foods wersquove been eating for thousands of years. Problems seem to have occurred with the processed foods wersquove had available for the last  years. Tradition has never done us any harm. Now everyonersquos terried about their health.Sipping milky tea and casting an eye over the ever-forming queue at the counter, she continues: ldquoIt makes me laugh when people come in to our bakery looking for gluten-free. But you can eat our sourdough bread because itrsquos slow-fermented for  hours, which reduces the gluten content dramatically, is more easily digested and therefore better for your gut. I spend a lot of time trying to tell people to try sourdough because itrsquos the best thing you can possibly eat.ldquoI tell them thatthey buy a supermarket loaf they should toast it before eating it to finish off the baking. Itrsquos over-processed and over-yeasted to bake in minutes rather than days and contains  ingredients instead of just three or four. When you eat it itrsquos going to keep cooking in your stomach and make you feel heavy and bloated. Bread should never feel heavy.ldquoEverything processed is why wersquove lost touch with fresh food. E-numbers, additives, colourants, preservatives and so on are all man-made and, of course, theyrsquore going to cause damage and health problems. Naturally occurring ingredients are hardly to blame.Traditional Scottish iced gingerbread, almond and pistachio croissants and chocolate brownies are her biggest sellers. ldquoItrsquos OK to have sugar in moderation. Little and often, she says, smiling. Her own favourites are the sourdough sandwiches made fresh every day and filled with locally sourced greenery. ldquoWe donrsquot do them to order, otherwise wersquod be making cheese and ham every day, she says, grinning.She already has her eyes on the future, and hopes to open a village greengrocers soon. ldquoWe want to stay in Dunkeld and open a village store where things will be properly sourced and we can support the local area, she says. ldquoAt the moment we can only buy plastic-wrapped apples from Spain at the local Co-op. Wersquod like to further help the local growers and producers, while completing the circular system in terms of sustainability, cutting food waste and increasing food security.She concedes that shersquos in the privileged position of being in the main street of a historic village which is popular with tourists with no large supermarkets or fast-food chains to dilute her influence. The local independent butcher, smokehouse, deli and whisky shop are hardly going to do that. In fact, she believes she is part of wider grassroots movement in Scotland that is being fed ndash and in turn consumed ndash by social media.The downside of being part of the Gen Z zeitgeist is she has in the past fallen foul of social mediarsquos more unpleasant side. A self-taught cook who grew up in Dunkeld, Shedden suffered a Twitter backlash when, as a contestant on GBBO, she said shersquod forgotten to switch on the electric oven because her parents had an Aga at home that she had over  cookbooks, most of them French and that she had picked up a recipe for biscotti while travelling in Italy. Such comments resulted in the Twittersphere posting that she was ldquotoo posh, ldquotoo middle-class and ldquotoo professional ndash comments that were picked up by the tabloids.She says now: ldquoI havenrsquot been on Twitter for months. I love Instagram, itrsquos a great way to communicate and a huge part of our business comes through it. It also helped us market our Crowdfunding campaign. It is about sharing. It is far more my vibe and less threatening than Twitter.ldquoThrough Instagram it never fails to amaze me how many fantastic wee independent food places, producers and initiatives there are right across Scotland now, she adds. ldquoI think people are a lot more aware of what theyrsquore eating and where their food comes from. They are aware of sourcing and what theyrsquore putting in their systems. Theyrsquore more interested in that than in price. I like to think that from our tiny part of the planet wersquore changing things bit by bit.Aran, Recipes and Stories from a Bakery in the Heart of Scotland, by Flora Shedden, is published by Hardie Grant at pound.BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND BIRNAM HONEYWe do our absolute best to source as many local ingredients as possible, and always encourage customers to come through the door with any of their own goods.

At the time of its discovery during the  season it was found to contain a human jawbone and two neonatal lambs.ldquoThe vessel had been placed just outside the broch wall, very close to the entrance, when the broch was put out of use around the mid-Second Century AD. As well as the whalebone vessel and jawbone, two red deer antlers had been propped against the vessel and a very large saddle quern, a grinding stone, had been positioned against the vessel to pin it firmly in place against the broch wall. All this treatment appears to have been part of the measures employed to perform an act of closure of the broch.There are several more fin whale items from the site so it should be possible to identy relationships between animals and also match bones across the area to the same animal.Beyond the vessel, there is also a particular concentration of bone in the broch and scientists say it will be interesting to see what this research can reveal about the use of whalebone in this monumental Iron Age structure.Fin whales are also among the fastest whales in the sea, capable of bursts of km h when hunting, or threatened, and they can e fast and very deeply.Indeed, in the modern era, the fin whale was only really hunted in large numbers once the explosive harpoon was invented and so it is unlikely to have been pursued in the Iron Age.That does not mean other types of whale were not hunted, and the question of whether some whales were pro-actively sourced during the Iron Age remains unanswered. In time, further study of patterns of whalebone and species recognition from sites like The Cairns may shed light on this."},{"url":null,"title":"world-first-electric-gritter-set-forth-crossings","story":"But now anelectric gritting vehicle, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the world, will help with efforts to keep Scotlandrsquos roads clear of snow while dramatically reducing carbon emissions.Transport Scotland bosses announced the state-of-the-art  per cent electric spreading vehicle will be trialled over the coming months.The Electra vehicle, which is part of a fleet of  gritters based at more than depots across the country, will undertake patrols on the Queensferry Crossing and the Forth Road Bridge, which is still used by buses.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the move is part of efforts to make the fleet of winter response vehicles ldquomore environmentally friendly.New weather stations and sensors on the M ndash the main road linking Edinburgh and Glasgow ndash are also to be trialled, as is a new form of road treatment using reduced amounts of salt, which will be initially used on the A.Meanwhile, transport chiefs said they would continue to lease specialist vehicles to deal with the most extreme winter conditions.After heavy snowfall in previous years resulted in major disruption to traffic, new route-specic snow plans have been drawn up for key roads across the country including the M, M, Mand M.Transport chiefs have almost , tonnes of salt in storage, more than was used in the whole of last winter.Mr Matheson said: ldquoOur teams have worked hard throughout the year to ensure we are ready when dficult winter conditions set in.

In fact, with the SNP in power since , it could be argued that supporting independence is the status quo position. If some polls are accurate support for independence now stands at  per cent. Opposing independence could soon be the minority view.Yet as support for independence grows ndash as it becomes the mainstream, and the sense of historic inevitability increases ndash therersquos also a feeling that the concept of Scottish independence is stagnating, that it needs reimagined.This election focuses that tension: as support for independence appears to near critical mass, the concept begins to look very tired. The debate about independence in this election will be relatively meaningless.:New poll published on Scottish independenceWe already know what will happen. Labour, Tories and the LibDems will say itrsquos bad, the SNP and the Greens will say itrsquos good. Therersquoll be no nuance. Therersquoll be no substantive debate. Therersquoll be no new thoughts about independence, about its shape and form, about what happens after a vote supporting independence. Itrsquoll be a constitutional pantomime.Independence will even overshadow Brexit. As an issue, Brexit still retains some nuance, making debate worthwhile. The same canrsquot be said of independence. Voters may be tired but they will listen to what the parties say about Europe because there may still be something to learn, something new to inform our thinking.But with independence, our minds are made up, and so are the politiciansrsquo minds. We know the story. Itrsquos a redundant debate. Yet, ironically independence is the debate which will dominate. The real issues which matter ndash jobs, climate, housing, health, policing, taxes, schools ndash theyrsquoll all get an airing, but we know theyrsquoll come second. This is an election which politicians, especially the SNP, know rests on the constitution.Herersquos the crucial problem for the independence debate: the only vision we have of independence is a nationalist one. Independence is seen by nearly all voters as an SNP issue ndash you donrsquot like the SNP, you donrsquot like independence. Of course, the Greens support independence, but despite an environmental message of hope, they find it almost impossible to breakthrough and get their voices heard.:Scottish Politician of the Year : Nominations revealed for national award ceremonyAfter the  referendum, voters split along constitutional lines. Most newly forged Yes voters left their old political homes, like Labour and the LibDems, for the SNP. No voters primarily kept to their traditional parties and dug in to repel the nationalists.This meant independence became the sole territory of the SNP. By the time the referendum was over,  per cent of the people supported independence - yet it was the domain of one party. Thatrsquos a democratic mess, and itrsquos led to intellectual stagnation and political entropy.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"description\": \"Nicola Sturgeon: Send a message to Westminster about Scottish independence\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media szeKVABJ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests szeKVABJ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Independence is too big an issue for the SNP alone. I speak as a Yes voter. The party hierarchy project a vision of independence which is cautious, managerial, and, frankly, uninspiring. The vision of independence projected by the SNPrsquos base is one wrapped in a saltire it feels blinkered, insular and smacks of old-style nationalism.The bottom line is that in Scotland a nationalist ideology thoroughly dominates the concept of independence. But as the  referendum showed, support for independence grew not among people who identied as nationalist, but among people who identied as progressive and internationalist, who wanted an outward-looking Scotland rather than a regressive Westminster.There are plenty of people who support independence but hate nationalism ndash Irsquom one. I know a lot of No voters ndash Labour, LibDem, and even Tory ndash who say now that they see independence as a viable choice. They no longer view it as something hostile. However, theyrsquoll never vote for it because of their deep antipathy towards the SNP.What would change the entire dynamic of the debate is this:the traditional unionist parties dropped their outright opposition to independence, took a neutral position, and allowed their members to think and vote freely on the issue. That way wersquod get some robust and imaginative thinking.Of course, I accept itrsquos probably a pipe-dream, but I also said this country needs to use its imagination to make politics better. Wersquore a brainy nation, not scared of big ideas ndash so dare to imagine.Imaginewe were given a socialist vision of independence by unshackled Labour politicians. That would certainly appeal to centre-left folk like me. Imagine how fascinating it would be to hear a radical Tory voice envision a capitalist form of independence. This type of change to the tempo of discussion would also allow the Green message ndash an environmental vision of independence ndash to break through, when itrsquos most needed. Most importantly, such an approach would detoxy debate, erode isions, and sow the seeds of unity.All this would pose a serious threat to the SNPrsquos stranglehold on power. Voters who arenrsquot drawn to the SNP, but do support independence, would find dferent candidates to back who they agree with on both the constitution and bread and butter issues.In the current Brexit mess, itrsquos hard for an independence supporter, whorsquos uncomfortable with the SNP, to find alternative candidates to vote for, especiallythey feel a Green vote is wasted. This isnrsquot healthy for democracy. Nor is it healthy for the SNP. The party is sluggish and complacent ndash it needs some fire at its heels.Itrsquos bewildering why all of the other parties fail to see any benefit in taking a neutral position on independence. Labour must realise the days of Gordon Brown are over. The party has taken such slippery positions on Brexit that it can surely find a slippery way to become neutral over independence.The LibDems defy the notion of liberal democracy in their dictatorial refusal to countenance a second indyref.And the Tories  Well, it seems crazy to think of the Tories being neutral on independence, but not so long ago the party was the bulwark of the union hellip until it threw Ulster unionism under the bus over Brexit. After all, the Conservatives would sell their granny for anything which gave them a soupccedilon more power.The simple fact is that a country on the cusp of great change ndash of possibly soon going it alone in the world as a new nation ndash needs vision for the future, and right now thatrsquos in pretty short supply. Irsquom not saying my utopian reimagining is right, but at least itrsquos something to think on, while we wait for the politicians to develop some new ideas.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"brian-beacom-love-idea-workplace-romances","story":"She in turn looks at you and notes the bed-creased, baggy-eyed face and the pre-coffee crankiness, and canrsquot help but wonder why that suit which hangs off you like a soggy fish hadnrsquot been donated to a charity. Now, this may not sound like a romantic scenario but it works for the four out of  office workers in Britainwho connect at some point in their career.Right now however, those who find love during working hours are being threatened with a cold bucket of water by worried HR staff, the debate prompted by the sacking of McDonaldrsquos boss Steve Easterbrook, who had a consensual relationship with an employee. And it was cranked up by a GMTV interview in which the CEO of lingerie business Bluebella, Emily Bendel, argued that relationships in the office lsquoneed to be declaredrsquo and there should be lsquoguidelinesrsquo.But Bendel is not only wrong, workplace relationships should be encouraged.

And there is a problem when there is a power imbalance. Bosses such as Easterbrook should certainly avoid a relationship with an employee.But to suggest HRs should be recording workplace romances between colleagues is a step too far. I can recall some years ago being taken aside one night by my editor and warned as to my future conduct after being spotted leaving the office late-ish with a colleague of the opposite sex. We were owned by STV at the time, who had a no fraternising policy. The assumption made by my worried editor was that myself and colleague were having Ugandan discussions, Which was a fair assumption. However, I was swt to point out there were no fewer than five workplace romances on the go, most of them related to our overlords at STV, involving bosses and subordinate females.My point however was not just to indicate hypocrisy, but to outline that office flings are there to be flung. And I added,the work is getting done, then what  matters Therersquos also a wider picture to be considered with workplace romances. Why should the terminally shy be punished because they canrsquot chat freely to people they donrsquot know in a bar  Why should someone with a couple of kids who canrsquot get out at the weekend be victimised by company policy  Itrsquos all very well for actor Emma Watson this week to declare shersquos happy to beldquoself-partnering but what of the austerity-raddled who canrsquot afford to dress up and hit the town And wouldnrsquot the imposition of romance be an indicator of borderline totalitarianism  To deny the chemistry a couple has is at least immoral.Yes, of course, work place rules should be adhered to no kissy kissy in the staff canteen, no allowing domestic fights to follow you into the office.

In one paper, the authors calculated the risk of death in almost four million people followed up for around ten years. Dog owners were  per cent less likely to die during that period than those who did not have one. The survival benefit was even greater in those people who had a history of a previous heart attack. The dog owners in this group had a  per cent reduction in risk of death compared to non-owners with previous heart attacks.It might be assumed that the benefit of having a dog was caused by the exercise people get from taking them for a walk. However, people might be sceptical that this could confer such health benefits. Surely a stroll with a pet is not nearly energetic enough  Surely, there must be other influences at work : Study finds owning a dog linked to better heart health: How to fix the NHS and Scotland’s health – Catherine CalderwoodFurthermore, associations between events do not prove that one event is the cause of the other and there may be many other explanations for the improved survival. For example, there is strong evidence that people who have strong social networks are less likely to die prematurely. The companionship and affection between dog and owner might make a positive contribution to wellbeing.A real effect on survivalHowever, a second paper, using data from Sweden, was able to take some account of issues like social and family networks and it, too, showed dog ownership to be associated with reduced risk of death after a heart attack or stroke. Dog ownership meant that those who lived alone and who had a heart attack were  per cent less likely to die than heart attack patients who did not own dogs. Dog owners were also  per cent less likely to die following a stroke. Reduced risks were also seen in dog owners who lived with their families. Dog ownership seems to have a real effect on survival.It seems that dog walking has greater health benefits than expected. But, can it really be true that exercise as mild as walking a dog prolongs your le  Current guidance in the UK suggests that, in order to get health benefits, adults should aim for at least  minutes of vigorous activity a week or  minutes of moderate activity. However, a third paper published a few weeks ago suggested that the risk of early death could be reduced with lower levels of exercise. A group of researchers from several dferent countries pooled the results of  studies which looked at the impact of running on mortality in around , people followed up for between five and  years. They found that those who went running had a  per cent lower risk of death during follow-up. Deaths from heart attacks were reduced by  per cent and deaths from cancer were  per cent lower in those doing some running. The important conclusion the authors came to was that more was not necessarily better. There was no statistical link between the frequency, duration or pace of running and the survival benefit. Any running, even once a week, they concluded, was better than no running and higher doses did not necessarily produce greater reductions in mortality. These studies seem to show that the benefits of being active start at low levels of activity. Any exercise is better than none.

Music, the sound psychology of emotion and feeling##.what can be stronger Bobis Johnson is music to the country#s ears.David,you areabsolutely correct. To take your comment a little further, I would say that the Arts are capable of contributing much more to human le and activity than has ever been so in the past.We are rapidly becoming slaves to science as well as being beneficiaries of its wonderful contributions to le in its widest sense.The attempts that we see to put one on a higher plane than the other are futile.Every facet of human endeavour should be in the mix with the aim of formingrounded rather than fragmented people.Very well put Haydn! The Arts also let people see their inidual and collective issues, wants and needs from dferent perspectives, so also assist democracy.Expressing our creativity is also a FUNdamental part of being human, and happily there are good dancers, singers and storytellers everywhere.If humanity is to survive and prosper an understanding of the Sciences and of the STEM subjects, is vital. Sadly our political classes are mostly in ignorance of the sciences, at every level. Their bizarre and idiotic decisions display that so well. A simple example, Shetland Island Council promotes and acquires battery-powered cars to reduce CO emissions. It only has, at this time, fossil fuel-generated power to charge them with, the result.an increase in CO footprint. How scientically mindless and stupid.Oh and don#t get me started on electric cars. I#ve driven a so called gas guzzler for years. I#ve not seen any so called climate change myself, yet still I drive. It still snows in winter does it not, yet the #green# lobby would have us believe that it will be raining frogs by we don#t change our ways. What utter tosh.Actually Jerry, the winters in Shetland are exceptionally mild these days. You can, literally, count on your hands the number of days it snows. Whether this is due to human activity and this of global warming is maybe questionable, BUT the evidence would suggest it probably is the case human activity being the major cause Is there a connection, overall,between global warming and much milder winters  I sincerely hope global warming is not a situation where, like most progression, some massive disaster has to take place before we do something about Maybe there’s a touch of the prophet in his own country not being recognised.Do I detect a wee bit of sarcasm there, Haydn  lolCan the SIC backing transition to battery powered cars reasonably be described as #bizarre and idiotic# Maybe Ian Tinkler hasn#t fully thought this through.The council#s decision to buy some electric cars helps to extend the necessary infrastructure across the isles, meaning Shetland becomes more ready to welcome visitors with electric cars.The incentives to change over will probably improve and more people will want to swap over.They will need the infrastructure which the SIC#s decision to acquire a greener fleet supports. Shetland#s own generated electricity can and will become cleaner overtime, so it seems a little hard to justy Ian#s claim that the council#s decision was #scientically mindless and stupid#.Its still not entirely clear what self-proclaimed scientic expert Ian#s beliefs and motives are, but climate change deniers might well describe preparing for the future as #bizarre and idiotic#. If Ian can#t come up with a dferent tune, perhaps he can change the record.Perhaps it may just be an intelligent option to wait until Shetland has a clean, non-diesel, power generating capacity be for investing tens and tens of thousands of pounds in an electric car fleet! Especially when tunning these cars vans produce a greater carbon footprint than diesel engine cars would in any case.. A bit too deep for you Peter  Visiting Shetland with electric cars has nothing to do with whatever transport fleet the SIC operate. After all, we have a good towage fleet, when batteries run flat.I agree with Ian. Does this mean he has changed his mind on the Viking wind farm then I see Shetland council have taken delivery of  electric cars. No cars were tunned . They were new.Buying new diesel cars would not have a lower carbon footprint versus buying new electric cars. The embodied energy to produce and ship both is similar. Yes,the electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels it means they are not zero emissions once delivered. But they soon will be as long as Ian doesn#t get his way with Viking. Of course, Ian will not be around to see the worst effects of climate change so can afford to worry about his views. Far more important than the future of humanity, when you balance it up## self-proclaimed scientic expert!!#, your word Peter, just graduate knowledge. Any youngster with Standard Grade science subjects would understand my points, Peter Hamilton. Clearly The STEM subjects were well outside your teaching brief. Was it #Arty subjects# you taught perchance  It is#bizarre and idiotic# to use battery cars when your power source is diesel generated. You actually increase your carbon footprint! Simples. Now ask any well-educated youngster and they will explain the science to you.#Simples# Well that is a scientic proof Popper would have been proud of!I think the personal attacks on Peter and his educationonly make your point stronger. I am a well educated youngster. I agree with you entirely. Peter is wrong, you are right.

I do think the government has to recognise the costs up here.#Ms Henderson described food bank usage as #shocking in this day and age#, and highlighted the Trussel Trust – the organisation behind the food bank – which had data on who is accessing the service.#Once you#ve got clearer information on the problem you can look at ways of dealing with it.#She described as #a sin# that perfectly good food was being thrown out by supermarkets just because it was at or near its sell-by date.Mr Robinson said the government#s roll-out of the universal credit was at the #root cause# of the problem.#It#s been an absolute shambles. How they expected folk could go for weeks without any money at all, just with the the promise it would be sorted out, I think is disgraceful.#He said the much-maligned #bedroom tax# had also been a contributing factor, and added it was important for people both in public and private sectors to have a fair living wage.Ms Valente said she had been shocked by the numbers of people who needed to use the food bank but were too ashamed of their poverty.#The cost of housing is one of the things I find quite shocking,# she said, adding that people needed to #earn a huge amount of money# to put a roof over their heads.She was also #appalled# by universal credit, and added it was wrong for society to #really target# or make people feel bad about being poor.Mr Wenger said people were encouraged to go to Citizens Advice Bureau, which could advise people on how to manage their finances.But Debra Nicolson, who stood as the Green candidate in the recent Holyrood campaign, pressed for more information on what candidates would doelected.Other questions were asked about the stigma attached to free school meals, and how it can be tackled.Ms Valente said responsibility lay with the government, but stressed the council needed to ensure social work staff and support services were fully prepared to help.Mr Robinson pointed to the -plus housing waiting list, and stressed affordable housing was key to solving the problem.Ms Henderson added there was an #antiquated rule# in the council that a percentage of the housing stock had to be kept free in case there was an emergency, and added she had argued that should be scrapped because #people need houses now#.Mr Flaws added there would always be a stigma until people are prepared to talk more openly about it.Mr Wenger said beating stigma, and preventing discrimination, needed to start at an early age. He added SSE had raised energy prices three times in one year, and stressed the issue should be picked up in the council.A former councillor, Iris Hawkins, wondered how well the candidates would adjust to #le in the goldfish bowl.#Mr Wenger said many people knew him already as a postman and as a tourist guide. He said he was a member of Transition Shetland.As a German, he said people had noticed his lack of Shetland dialect, although he admitted having problems with English accents, too.#The most problems I have with the English isI look down to the #sooth-moothers# at  Downing Street#.Ms Valente said being a councillor meant #you can#t win#, because pleasing one person would mean upsetting another.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep at night with a clean conscience.#You just have to do the best job that you can so you can sleep well at night with a clean conscience# FRANCIS VALENTEMr Robinson has #been there before#. He said the hardest thing was the impact being a councillor can have on elected members# families.#You do have to really know what you#re in for.#Mr Flaws said he had read the hardest part was putting yourself forward in the first place.#To actually make the decision and say #this is the time. It suits me now#. Once that#s done you just have to get on with it.#As for Ms Henderson, she stressed she would be #very happy# to be accountable from the start.#There will be no curtains in my goldfish bowl,# she said.The site of a new Gilbert Bain Hospital was then brought up by chairman Jim Anderson, with Mr Robinson – who chairs NHS Shetland – left feeling distinctly on the spot.#I think wherever the site is it needs to be somewhere that is close to,not within, Lerwick. That#s going to be one of the real challenges.#Mr Wenger had his eye across the Bressay Sound.#Build the fixed link to Bressay, and build the Gilbert Bain Hospital on Bressay,# he told Mr Anderson.Mr Flaws admitted there were few options on where the hospital could be built.#You have to be looking on the outskirts of Lerwick – the south road or the north road.#Ms Valente said there was no easy solution.#I suspect any decision to build the hospital is going to be  years down the road.#Ms Henderson said any consideration needed to be #future-proofed#. But she said she was prepared to look outside of the town for the solution.#If you#ve got really good shuttle links that would ease some of the congestion. If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands.#If you have it nearer Tingwall it#s more central for the rest of the islands# CAROLINE HENDERSONGreen issues were raised by Debra Nicolson, who said the SIC#s economic strategy was supportive of Sullom Voe and the gas plant until at least . Where did the candidates stand on this in light of the climate emergency Mr Flaws said he believed that was why the council had not yet declared a climate emergency.#The council is going to have to update its carbon management plan and see how it is going to bring this forward.#The council needs to be more transparent on what their long-term thinking is.#Part of the discussion focused on the Viking Energy windfarm.Ms Henderson said it was dficult to address Sullom Voe #until they#ve said what they want to do#.She added she was #not a fan# of the inter-connector, and the Viking windfarm was #not a green scheme – it#s only green in the context of money#.Meanwhile, Mr Robinson said the council should declare a climate emergency #and not worry about the oil companies#.He said BP had a #huge solar arm# in its organisation, while Total also promoted its environmental credentials and the Danish Dong Energy had gone completely out of the oil and gas sector.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything.#Without declaring the emergency I don#t think there#s any real impetus to do anything– GARY ROBINSONMr Wenger said Sullom Voe helped provide the UK with oil and gas.But he said attitudes were changing, particularly with a growth in electric car usage.#Electricity you can produce without burning fossil fuels is the best.#Ms Valente said it was impossible to get rid of fossil fuels #over night#, but stressed thinking had to start now.#Maybe Shetland can do without Sullom Voe but the economy of Britain still depends on that. We need to bring it down and work on other solutions.#But I think the council does need to declare a climate emergency.#Questions were also raised on ferry links to the mainland, with concerns voiced about the number of cabins and the freight constraints.Ms Valente said the boats were #not fit for purpose,# and added capacity for freight was #dreadful#.Mr Robinson said Shetland should be able to design a ferry to suit its own needs. He said the real problems with NorthLink vessels lay at constraints at Aberdeen Harbour, as well as regulations which limited where on a vessel cabins could be placed.#To my mind we really should have the power locally to resolve our own ferry service, so we can design something that works for us.#Mr Flaws said the ferries were commissioned roughly  years ago. He said it was dficult for his family of five to get away on the ferry.#They#re just not fit for purpose. We need to say what we need rather than be told what we should be using.#Discussion also focused on the bus service, with support for cheaper – or even,possible, free – buses being offered.Mr Flaws said it would be good to see more people using buses.#If it was cheaper or free then maybe more folk would be using it. If that was an incentive to get more folk on it, then that should be looked at,# although he acknowledged some bus times did not suit everybody.Ms Valente cited an occasion when she lived in Sandveien when the bus could get her to work just before am.#They they changed the service, so that actually you either had to get to work by half eight or half nine. It#s just ridiculous. I do not know how that happened.#Mr Wenger said e-buses – smaller units which can be called upon using an app – should be adopted. He added he had enjoyed a positive experience with an electric bike.Mr Robinson – a convert to the bike himself – said there was no easy answer on buses.#The last thing you want to do is run a bus with three folk on it when in actual fact that#s causing a bigger carbon footprint than a car with three folk in it.#He berated the absence of any buses in Shetland that ran on anything other than diesel. He cited Dundee, which had a number of electric taxis.Questions were raised about how a councillor might get things discussed with other members.Mr Robinson said climate change was something he would consider attempting to raise a notice of motion over – a measure which would ensure the topic is debated in the chamber.#That is one thing the council has failed to move on so far. I suspectyou were to canvas the councillors and ask them to sign it, you#d probably get half the councillors for a start. I fail to understand why they#ve not moved on it. It#s ridiculous.#Mr Flaws said an issue that kept coming back was that people had no idea what the council#s strategy was with sustainable energy.#It#s Viking Energy, or it#s nothing,# he said.Ms Valente said she wanted to ensure everyone#s house was insulated.#There are people living in houses that are cold. There are people who can not afford to do it and are choosing between putting the heating on and having something to eat.#Mr Wenger said council office buildings should be insulated, but Ms Henderson said it was important to deal with the issues constituents bring forward. raquoInteresting, with fuel poverty so high on the agenda Gary Robinson wants to declare a #climate emergency# causing the SIC to spend scarce money on #tackling climate change#. However, the UK government has already set its #net zero # target into law, as recommended in the IPCC#s  Special Report. The Scottish government has gone even further with #net zero #. This will cost UK energy consumers over £ trillion# enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years! # causing fuel poverty to continue to soar.SIC will be allocated compulsory government targets, to achieve the above aims. Any SIC action beyond that would be superfluous and not scientically justied i.e. motivatedby virtue-signalling. SIC should spend any spare resources on alleviating fuel poverty, already % of Shetland homes, and set to expand dramatically with the above targets.I#m surprised Mr Robinson, chairman of NHS Shetland, shows such cavalier disregard for those infuel poverty when over , people died of coldin the much milder climate of England and Wales, in  .The fuel poverty buck stops there, people die unnecessarily.The #excess winter deaths I referred to are shocking and were due to people#s inability to heat their homes adequately. These are people infuel poverty.Were , people to die during a summer heat wave, the #climate emergency# fraternity would become apoplectic and there would be a frenzy of closing down every means of using fossil fuel. But winter deaths are nothing new and these people are poor, so perhaps, they don#t count .As explained above, #climate emergency# does not come from the IPCC. It is a fad of the well-off, the bourgeoisie, who care nought for the fate of the poor but wish solely to use it as a ruse to win middle class votes using alarmist rhetoric.The Shetland Partnership has a specic objective of reducing fuel poverty by a third, by  # how is that progressing And a further aim of halving it by   Aye!The SIC and NHS Shetland are key members of the Shetland Partnership and councillors need to focus on fuel poverty as, not only will this aim not be achieved, the situation will become much worse, as a result of current government climate policy..."},{"url":null,"title":"americana artist returns for double header ","story":"One of Scotland’s finest exponents of Americana music is ing to the islands for two intimate shows this week.Glasgow-based singer-songwriter Daniel Meade will be accompanied by guitarist Lloyd Reid for concerts at The String in Lerwick on Thursday and Friday night, supported by Adam Guest and Sheila Henderson respectively., last year. was single of the week on BBC Radio Scotland.#We have worked up a large repertoire of material over the years that we dip into depending on the occasion and audience#, said Meade.#Upbeat, downbeat and everywhere in between, these shows will be mainly leaning on material from the three most recent albums we’ve released.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services alerted after cliff incident ","story":"A woman has been rescued from clfs in the South Mainland after getting into dficulty on Wednesday afternoon.Coastguard teams had been alerted and the rescue helicopter scrambled after the woman became stranded near Exnaboe.Shetland Coastguard said the woman was taken from the clf by a hi-line transfer, which allowed her to be taken safely into the helicopter.The Lerwick Leboat was providing cover off-shore.Ambulance personnel and coastguard representatives are manning the emergency landing site in Lerwick, where the casualty was taken before being transferred to the Gilbert Bain Hospital..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/STORR-AERIAL-VIEW-1.jpg","title":"editorial we cannot and should not expect skyes tourist industry to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLast week Mark Crothall, the chief executive of the independent industry body the Scottish Tourism Alliance, denied that Scotland as a whole suffered from #overtourism#.Instead, argued Mr Crothall, the country has a couple of #pressure points# which in their season attract a lot of people and a lot of publicity.The most prominent of Mark Crothall#s pressure points are — you guessed it — Edinburgh and the island of Skye.In a sense the question is academic. If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise.

Instead, it leads to the booze aisle in thelocal supermarket and to a drinking den out on the moor.In this, the maincharacter in Kevin MacNeil’s novel ‘The Stornoway Way’ is depicted as havingmuch in common with his fellow islanders, whether or not they absorb their localminister’s thunderous moralising. Theplay of the same name, which MacNeil also wrote, pulls no punches so far asdevastating social critique is concerned.There’s a lot in a name. RomanStornoway can be read as romance torn away. He is also R Stornoway. He is a religiouscuckoo in the nest and the key in a roman a clef. The character himselfacknowledges all this. As an everyman outsider, Mister S is meant tocommunicate a great deal about Lewis.Calvinism, alcohol and climatecombine in a pernicious cocktail that permeates people and place. Depression, repression and addiction are endemic.So are dreams of escape.If this is the desolate reality in which MacNeil’s characters are immersed, the play of the novel # staged by Dogstar Theatre at Sabhal Mor Ostaig last week # sugars the pill with scabrous wit, hilarious minor characters, and some truly moving songs, among them a traditional Gaelic lament rendered with crystalline clarity by Lewis-born actor Rachel Kennedy. It is a sublime moment where Roman reconnects with the culture he scorns. But the moment passes, and the song of loss and love is soon replaced with cynicism and tomorrow’s hangover.All good writing, whetherfor page or stage, interweaves the personal, the local and the universal. Roman’s war is with himself and with Lewishis dreams are of finding love and self-fulfilment. The universal arrives inthe shape of Eva, a Hungarian student who initially succumbs to Roman’s scatterguncharm, but who later comes to see him as self-obsessed and manipulative. Roman is certainly that. Heis also vulnerable, funny, and capable of great profundity.Self-fulfilment comesthrough music, and when Roman’s long-suffering best friend Eilidh organises asession for him in a recording studio in Edinburgh, the road to salvationopens. But Roman is a master at self-sabotage. Matters don’t quite go to plan.Naomi Stirrat as Roman,Rachel Kennedy as Eilidh and Chloe-Ann Tylor as Eva are all fine actors, and adeptat lively theatricality. As an ensemble,they tick like a Swiss watch, darting here and there without missing a beat. Andthey can’t half belt out a tune.

Anyone that met her - she took a piece of their heart straight away and they never forgot her.Ruby had to battle a lot day to day, but she did it with huge strength, she was fully depended on us   for all of her care. This was huge for us as a family.Ruby did not sleep at night. She had a lot of cerebral irritation and suffered from frequent seizures daily We, as her parents, were the only ones able to provide this care.This is where the Hospice played a huge part in our lives, Ruby attended the hospice for respite from the age of six months. The hospice is a home away from home that provides the most amazing care and love to the children and their families with full : medical care  .We, as a family, felt completely comfortable that Ruby was being cared for to the highest standard, in a place filled with love and joy. This gave us time to refuel to keep going that bit longer.The Hospice were also there for us in Ruby’s end of le care, we spent our final two days with her there, in the comfort of a home setting with the support of the nursing staff around us.This gave us precious time that we would never have got anywhere .We made memories that we will cherish forever and we are truly indebted to the Hospice for having such a signicant impact in our final days with Ruby.We decided to host Rubys Birthday Fundraiser last year and it was a huge success, raising an amazing pound,.

I continue to tell my story of grief and Ruby’s le on my blog Chasingladybirds it has been a good way help journey through grief and to also reach out to others in the same situation.Everyone that knew Ruby knew that ladybirds was her wee thing.When she was only a few months old a ladybird landed on her toes one summer day and thats where it all started.In my journey of grief I decided that blogging might be a good outlet and a good way to share my story and journey of grief.Chasing ladybirds came from our connection of ladybirds with Ruby, and Chasing was down to we will always chase Ruby’s memory.We will never forget our memories and love for her - we will always chase every moment we had with her.Lisa and her family would love ityou can make it to Rubys Birthday Fundraiser.Admission costs pound for adults and children go free.

We have yet to come up with a better system but we are open to finding alternatives that are viable and affordable,” he said.“In recent weeks, we have seen some of those challenges in communities across the country. If people fear that their community, their identity is under attack, they will respond in ways that we can understand.“Too often, the sad reality is that the alternative is what happens in France and Greece and Italy which are camps and containers and I am determined we never reach that point in Ireland.”He said the Government is seeking input from Ireland’s migrant community on improving standards in Direct Provision and that newer centres have higher standards.“Newer accommodation offers own door, self catering accommodation and that is exactly what we want to have for everyone as everyone should have their own door and be able to cook and prepare their own food,” he said.Mr Varakdar criticised the recent protests being held against direct provision centres.“Too often, and I have to say it does concern me – is that we see people opposing accommodation centres in their neighbourhood or blocking migrants from moving into the local hotel under the guise of humanitarianism and opposition to Direct Provision,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the government is working to engage with communities where direct provision centres will be placed “to show how their town or village or parish will be enhanced enough diminished by the arrival of newcomers”.He said: “It’s never said, but I think it is worth saying. There are no protests at communities that already have accommodation centres. The fear evaporates, when people meet the reality, and particularly when they meet people who are that reality.“I think we need to engage better with communities and listen to respond to their concerns. That has to be done by government. That’s our responsibility.”Mr Varadkar also warned against those from the far-right who are coming to communities where direct provision centres will be placed to stoke up dissent.“Scaremongering needs to be called out by those who seek to exploit local concerns for their own political, personal, or in some cases, racist reasons,” he said.He also said the government “stands firmly against illegal immigration” into Ireland.He added: “It should not be a controversial thing to say but apparently it is sometimes – that you support legal migration and you don’t support illegal immigration.“We will step up our efforts to stop people being trafficked illegally into Ireland by gangs and also those who seek to enter Ireland unlawfully no matter how small that number might be.”Mr Varadkar spoke about his own background, as the son of an Irish woman and an Indian immigrant and growing up as “a person of colour” in Dublin.He said that by becoming leader of the country, he showed what is possible for migrants coming to Ireland.He said , people have become Irish citizens since  and some , people who came here undocumented have since been regularised last year under a new scheme.Mr Varadkar said while many migrants coming to Ireland work in healthcare and technology, more efforts should be made to encourage people from migrant backgrounds to join the civil service, the Garda and the Army.He added that additional funding should also be given to political parties that encourage people from migrant backgrounds to stand as candidates in local elections."},{"url":null,"title":"pilot draws picture of boeing 747 in sky on planes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is an honour and privilege to do the work I do. “It is a wonderful feeling to help people, and so fantastic to share skills and techniques with children at a young age that they can carry with them and use for the rest of their lives.”Sarah says she hopes other schools in the area get on board with the Minding Mini Me, Overcoming Anxiety for Kids workshop.“We all go through so many ups and downs in le andchildren are aware of how they can help themselves, it gives them a much better chance to develop resilience to tackle what comes their way. “My own personal challenges due to having Multiple Sclerosis mean I have to draw on these skills regularly and I would like to share this with the children. “I want them to know that disability does not have to hold you back and the importance of being respectful of others with challenges. “This will all fit inreally well with the schools ethos and the fact they are marking anti bullying week when I am doing the workshops.”The Minding Mini Me workshops will take place on Wednesday, November  and Friday, November . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

DUG states: “University provision is necessary to transform this. In the past three decades, Ireland’s other ‘Atlantic Coast’ cities - Cork, Galway and Limerick – have seen their student numbers soar in tandem with their local economies. “Derry Strabane has a total population of ,, with a third-level student population of, at best, ,. “Corkhas a population of , and, with the opening of a new campus in , will have a third-level student population of approximately , – ten times that of the North West. It has an outstanding reputation for its cultural, tourism and recreational facilities.”It says that Derry  Strabane Council’s Strategic Growth Plan is “entirely dependent” on university expansion which doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, with Derry’s student numbers, “already the worst on the island”, dropping again.Cold water has also been poured on Magee expansion by Head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, when he cast doubt over the long-promised Medical School build.Meanwhile, figures published by the Department for the Economyshow , NI students were in higher education in England, Scotland or Wales in  - a ten-year high.And according to the latest statistics, Derry Strabane is the only region of the North that is a net exporter of its young people.“UU has categorically failed to make any progress on its  promise to have , students at Magee by ,” the DUG says. googletag.cmd.push Curriculum Courses at a new independent university must, the group says, offer as broad an academic programme as is practical, reflecting the traditions, strengths and specialisms of the region within its curricula.Therefore, it envisages a full syllabus boasting courses in Medicine, Law, IT, Engineering, Arts, Commerce, but also specialise in and promote courses which are unique to Derry.Long-standing engineering traditions, evident in the City Walls and homegrown engineering companies such as EI, Seagate and InVistashould be reflected.In terms of innovation, Derry currently houses two science parks, conducting research in Articial Intelligence, robotics, virtual augmented reality. “It was the first Irish city to partner with MITto pursue research into D printing, currently running a number of Fab-Labs in schools and communities. “Thousands of people work in IT business support in the North West, with Pramerica employing , people in North Donegal.”There would also be courses in Irish History with Derry being Ireland’s longest continuously inhabited Christian settlement, and the region once home to a number of High Kings in the Middle Ages. These would be complemented by courses in Marine Military History.As a region “bursting with creative talent” Arts, Drama and Music courses are also high on the agenda.The document cites Derry’s reputation as an international leader in modern literature and conflict resolution - with Nobel laureates in both disciplines.Literature  Philosophy, Conflict Resolution  Trauma Relief, Conflict Journalism and Tourism  Heritage are amongst a plethora of subjects synonymous with the city which could be taught at an independent university. Bridging the border The DUG believes there is an urgent need to mitigate against Brexit by ‘bridging the border’ with a new independent university in the North West, recognised and supported by both the Irish EU and British governments, which would have “the freedom and autonomy to serve, andin, both jurisdictions.“Such a facility, centred in Derry, would immediately establish a partnership with the existing Letterkenny Institute of Technology, less than  miles away. The parent university could apply to become a constituent member of both the National University of Ireland and Universities UK. “This would allow it to benefit from both organisations’ administrative expertise. Formal links with southern institutions would, moreover, solidy the European identity of Northern students and, post Brexit, would help protect the rights of Irish citizens in the North as per the Good Friday Agreement.“It is time to renew and regenerate our powerful scholastic legacy. It is time to repudiate the Lockwood Report and correct this historical travesty by immediately establishing a new, independent university.”The Derry University Group has lobbied London, Dublin and US government officials calling for the establishment of a new city-region university. It has made presentations to the Irish government calling for the new university to become a constituent of the National University of Ireland. The group has received official recognition from Derry City and Strabane District Council and the international Derry-Donegal diaspora association Futureproof North West.In , following visits to the North West by the British Labour peer Andrew Adonis and frontbench MPs Mike Amesbury and Mike Kane, Lord Adonis told the Upper House that the decision to deny Derry a standalone university was a “scandal”. He also called for a review of Higher Education provision in the North which has since been published.

A gun battle was raging between the military and paramilitary. He was an unwilling, innocent spectator. This personal experience, in Belfast’s Ballymurphy, was a snapshot of a society bereft of civil rights and constantly consumed with relentless violence. His interview with former Deputy First Minister, the SDLP’s Seamus Mallon, perfectly encapsulates both the tragedies of ‘The Troubles’ and the hopes for a better future. In ‘Born to Lead’ Seamus narrates a comprehensive overview of the historical triumphs of two ‘half parish’ GAA clubs – Slaughtneil, one of the greatest all-round clubs the Association has ever seen and the mighty men of Mullinalaghta, the outstanding  Leinster Senior football club champions. googletag.cmd.push This book is essentially a cameo of seventy years of Irish social, political and cultural le. It ranges from the showband era of the ’s to the splendid contribution of two present day Country music stars. Their current status emphasises the inherent value of “singing the songs of the people for the people”. Likewise, the y careers of two recently retired GAA players illustrate the importance of total dedication towards achieving personal goals. The author examines the mind set of some of his fellow alumni of St. Patrick’s College, Armagh. Insightful profiles of the legendary scoring exploits of Hogan Cup winner, Iggy Jones, and the versatility of Horslips’ Barry Devlin, are a microcosm of twelve, other gted SPCA luminaries who are also featured. All of them help immensely to make this superb book a wonderful and enjoyable read. Seamus will be launching Born to Lead in Slaughtneil Hall on Saturday, November ,  at .pm. The event is open to all and everyone is welcome.

It paves the way for the Council to engage formally with Central Government to request financial assistance to secure the sustainability of the City of Derry Airport beyond  March . At the meeting, members agreed toapprove a maximum additional underwrite of funding for CODAbetween now and st March  of poundk from in-year capital savings. The total funding required to ensure the airport can continue to operate beyond st March  is a sum of almost poundm per annum. This requirement includes continued operating subsidy , London PSO subvention as well as capital costs to ensure compliance with aviation regulations. googletag.cmd.push Councillors heard how the City of Derry Airport while facing a number of challenges, currently offers customers five key routes across the UK including London, Glasgow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Liverpool providing better connectivity than ever for both businesses and visitors to the region. The Airport, a key employer that positively impacts on local economy through business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m, is working very proactively on route development to build on this foundation and improve links to the North West to open up the gateway to the City and Region. Members of the committee heard in detail about the signicant amount of work done to secure Government support up to the end of March , and how additional Government funding for a minimum six-year period would assist in retaining this connectivity to key destinations in the UK beyond the  March , while essential rail infrastructure investment across the North West is progressed, in particular the A and A. It was outlined to members that the rationale for additional support for the airport would further consolidate the work that has gone into developing the airport and further developing its potential as a vital link within Ireland, the UK and Europe. The move will protect investment in the region, build confidence in our ability to deliver as a centre for business and promote further interest in the North West. Members were told that ultimately the main objective of Council and its strategic partners is the growth and development of the City and Region. The airport has a pivotal role to playcontributing to the delivery of a number of priorities outlined in a series of key relevant government strategies including the draft Programme for Government, Regional Development Strategy, draft Industrial Strategy for Northern Ireland and the ROI National Development Plan . Members were informed how UK Government funding subvention for the PSO route from Derry to London is currently provided at % until March  but will reduce to % thereafter. Council would not have the financial resources to bear this additional cost beyond that point and the full support of Government or Governments for the continued operation of the Airport beyond March  is required. The Council Chief Executiveoutlined to Members the need for Government to work with the Council to provide additional financial support in the form of continued % PSO subvention as well as operational and capital funding support for the Airport post  to ensure its medium term viability in providing continual connectivity to London and other key UK destinations. Members of the committee heard of the current financial challenges being faced by the Airport. Reduced passenger numbers have had a substantial impact on income and changes to flight schedules has resulted in the airport to stay open longer, which has in turn had an impact on the operational costs. Other challenges include - Air Passenger Dutyof pound the single issue affecting growth in the UK and particularly NI Route development, which is directly linked to APD because the heavy tax burden imposed by APD, makes it more attractive for carriers to start up new routes where. The signicant Central Government funding provided to airports in other regions of the UK and Ireland to ensure the sustainability and operation of small regional airports, the current global economic crisis including the lowering of disposable income, high fuel costs and lowering the tendency to fly and the uncertainty around Brexit. It was outlined how European Commission state aid guidelines acknowledge that under current market conditions airports operating under , passengers are experiencing dficulty covering operational costs. Members of the Committee also agreed that Council underwrite an additional sum up to pound, to keep the City of Derry operational to March  as an interim measure to allow the Airport to operate whilst engagement continues with Government. Members were informed that this additional subvention would be allocated from in-year capital savings and therefore have no recurring impact on rates. Members were informed that this additional support will also directly protect up to  jobs at the airport, a further  jobs through indirect and induced employment and a further  jobs through catalytic impacts of business productivity and tourism and provides an overall estimated annual GVA to the NI economy of pound.m and that said despite the challenges, intensive cost saving measures carried out by the Airport Board over the past number of months were not sufficient to mitigate against these pressures and an increased subvention was necessary. Members were also advised that moving beyond , it is hoped that the proposed formal engagement with Central Government in relation to contributions towards ongoing revenue costs would allow Council’s current funding to substantially reduce with associated savings then being available for other key strategic projects identied in the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan. It was outlined at the meeting how the Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan -  recognises that highly effective transport infrastructure is vital for the economy and the integral role played by City of Derry Airport in making Derry-Londonderry and the wider North West City Region a more attractive and competitive proposition for inward investors. Its importance in terms of the development and growth of the region’s tourism potential, whilst also delivering economic and social benefits to local communities and the North-West region as a whole, were relayed to members. Members were informed how a key action highlighted within the Strategic Plan is improved connectivity and frequency of flights from City of Derry Airport to major business hubs. The development and sustainability of the Airport and the need for support from government for City of Derry Airport to help the development of new routes, improve connectivity and boost economic growth for the wider city region by increasing access, is also included in the Strategic Growth Plan. The proposals agreed by members are subject to ratication by Full Council later in the month.

The spokesperson added: “Shaun has a proven track record of standing up for ordinary people and wont let you down.” Cllr Harkin said every vote for People Before Profit is a vote for a socialist Ireland, for an alternative to unionism and nationalism and for an end to “elitist Westminster rule. He added: The Tories have ruled the roost for the last decade with contempt for ordinary people. The DUP shamefully propped them up to continue the attack on public services, welfare, workers rights, the environment and threaten a hard border. googletag.cmd.push “Boris Johnson embodies Westminsters failed democracy and the elitism of the rich and powerful. He needs to go. We want to bring Tory DUP rule to an end for good. “People Before Profit can be trusted to vote to scrap welfare reform, undo anti-trade union laws, reverse privatisation of public services and resist any attempt to reimpose a hard border here. !Well vote to increase taxes on billionaires. Well vote to stop corporations from polluting the planet. All the establishment parties in the North are complicit in implementing Tory policies through Stormont. They voted to bring in vicious welfare reforms. They voted to cut taxes on corporations. They refused to undo Tory anti-trade union laws. “They have overseen the privatisation of the NHS, the running down of our schools, the destruction of the Housing Executive and disastrous environment policies. They assisted the DUPs effort to block equality for women and LGBT+ community. “Establishment parties here cant be trusted to end Tory rule. They cant be trusted to stand up to corporations and climate polluters. They cant be trusted to stand up for ordinary people. Cllr Harkin concluded: “On December  Vote Shaun Harkin in to get Boris Johnson and the Tories out.” Councillor Harkin contested the constituency at the last General Election in  and polled , votes. His selection brings to three the total of confirmed candidates for the Foyle constituency, joining sitting MP Elisha McCallion and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood.

There for all to see. For the youth to aspire to.It wasn’t always glory days in the shadow of Carntogher. There were lean times.While the club camogs go in search of a fourth Ulster title in succession this weekend, it is another step on the journey.From being also rans, their progression transformed them into the undisputed Queens of the All-Ireland Club championship.For Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein, joint captain alongside Siobhan Bradley, their pathway was a gradual one.   googletag.cmd.push    The cornerstones were belief and work, helped by a blossoming group of players that began to knock louder on the door of destiny.With less than two weeks to another championship showdown with Loughgiel, Niacute Cathaacutein is the essence of calmness.In the adjoining building the underage hurling management teams gather to take stock on the season and plant the seeds for .The camogie story is similar. No secrets, just organised graft.“It was years of hard work,” Niacute Chathaacutein offers, of how Slaughtneil’s camogie has morphed into national dominance.Committed. Dedicated. Two words she uses to describe the girls she has battled with.After living in the shadow of Eoghan Rua and going home empty-handed, it was time to change.“We came together as a group and decided we needed to do something, that we had to put in the extra work we hadn’t been doing,” she recalls of the period ‘in and around’ their first county title in .“We thought something has to change, where we have to step it up a gear, to decide we are either taking it serious or not.”A lack of belief was holding them back. Slowly but surely that changed. Under PJ O’Mullan, the current Loughgiel manager, Damien McEldowney and Dympna Dougan they finally got over the line.“Winning that first Derry title and it still is one of the best titles we have won, personally. It was a great achievement,” the Emmet’s defender adds.After a heavy defeat in Ulster at the hands of Antrim champions Rossa, they relinquished their hold on the Derry championship for the next two seasons.“Getting beat is a learning curve, as much as winning. Every match you have things to learn and improve, to go back to the drawing board after.“After those couple of defeats, we decided we’d rather be winning and we had the calibre of players. The management changed and were happy to put in the effort and that really started the winning .“Damien , Mickey , Woody , Shaunand now Padraig , with Thomasalso being on board….it was a great bunch of management in recent years.”After living on the outskirts of success, looking in, Slaughtneil are now on the other side. They are now the envy and the hunted.“With experience, learning and a bit of confidence in ourselves as a team, I would say that has developed and filtered in through everybody. Once you get that….it’s harder to back down.”The new generation breaking into the team had their share of success at underage level. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein played on a ‘strong’ side on her way up through the ranks - namechecking Jolene Bradley, Cara Cassidy, Mary Kelly, Siobhan Bradley, Eiliacutes and Aoe Niacute Chaiside among those she hurled with.“We were getting to championship finals. We weren’t always winning but we were fortunate to be one of the strongest teams throughout underage. The younger girlshad been on the winning end of things.”After getting to the pinnacle, the appetite for success is a motivator. With other teams hot on their heels, the Slaughtneil mantra is about continued improvement. Both collectively and on an inidual basis. “Among ourselves, we were more competitive with one another because you know there are only  places and everybody wants to be making that team, which is great.“The underage players that have come through are always stepping up. Every year, there are new players coming on board and they are always willing to put in the work…fighting for their places and that keeps everybody on their toes.”One constant in Slaughtneil’s rise has been Loughgiel, the last team to beat them in the championship – a - to - Ulster Final defeat in .Niacute Cathaacutein terms them as “our old friends,” with both teams knowing each other inside out.“They are a good bunch of girls and like ourselves, are hardworking and are good camogie players. It is a great thing for Ulster camogie with the two teams and you are guaranteed a good match between us. “Loughgiel are a great team and they were the last team to beat us. There is never anything between us. They have lost players this year but so have we. It will be interesting to see how it goes.”The defeat of four years ago is rarely talked about but sits close enough to the surface to always be remembered. Even in the face of all the recent success, that memory is always enough to sharpen the focus.The epic games they have been involved in have helped shape their character. Clawing their way back from the jaws of defeat to force a replay, before Mary Kelly’s winning goal secured a first Ulster.The battle with Thomastown in Inniskeen, the resolve to win the All-Ireland after the final was twice called off due to snow and last year clinching the three-in-a-row.“That mental strength to come back time and time again is good,” offers Niacute Chathaacutein. “It is something we know we are good at. We keep going to the bitter end, no matter how dficult the task is and Loughgiel is another task ahead.”It is not a matter of nerves.“As a team, we are pretty composed and we would always focus on staying in control of our emotions. Getting nervous is always a good thing, it shows that you actually care.”After years of nothing, following by unrivalled success, the battle for supremacy continues.

New projects this year included social prescribing mdash helping people who present to their local GP to get out and about in their local area.New investment in multi-disciplinary teams in GP practices in Down was now being rolled out to the rest of Newry and Mourne. He said the Network was central to that roll-out and CDRCNrsquos experience of social prescribing made the organisation a great source of referrals to local community activities.Cllr Casey said CDRCN along with Community Advice and other umbrella support organisations were key to the delivery of Council services. He was grateful to the Network and especially to the hundreds of groups and thousands of volunteers who work away, day and night with no financial reward to make sure this area is a safe, pleasant and prosperous place to live, work and play.Alan Dumigan, CDRCN chairman, thanked the outgoing management committee for their time and expertise in bringing the Network forward.He acknowledged Board member Doris Noe, of Lecale Conservation, who, he said, had contributed her time, energy and expertise over the last number of years to the organisation and he wished her well in her retirement from the board.He thanked the community groups for their ongoing support and the management and staff for their continued commitment.The guest speaker, Dr Chris Leggett, recalled his long association with the community network and the exciting new developments.

We are being terrorised in our homes and our property is being damaged.Mrs Smyth said it was almost impossible to report incidents to the police.ldquoIf we can get through the police often donrsquot respond, she continued. ldquoThese temporary gates have been being put up for almost two years now. Torn down and put up again. Itrsquos the residents who suffer, not the council people for delays in signing off on the workthat needs to be done.The residents are being supported by local Independent councillor Cadogan Enright, who accused the council of being ldquonot exactly on top of their game.He said: ldquoThe need for fences and gates to make the area into a cul-de-sacs was triggered by an emergency situation where pensioners were and still are under siege by a small number of nersquoer-do-wells, culminating with the actual burning down of a pensionerrsquos cottage.ldquoThe council have not been treating this as an emergency. Were it not for the Housing Executive repeatedly replacing the eight temporary steel and wood barriers week after week when they are torn down, the area would be unviable as an area where pensioners can live.He added: ldquoI have proposed a workshop between the social partners led by the PSNI, Housing Executive, council and other partners to agree in detail a step-by-step process for gating orders in writing so that we never again have such a series of dreadful delays.A spokesman for the council said last night: Newry, Mourne and Down District Council can advise that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has applied to the council for gating orders in the Model Farm area and that the Council is currently following gating order guidance produced by the Department of the Environment.ldquoThis process requires consultation with the Department for Infrastructure and members of the public in the area. A public advertisement of the proposals is then required. It is expected that this process will be complete in December .ldquoThe Policing and Community Safety Partnershiphas increased the number of Community Safety Warden patrols in this area over the last few weeks as a deterrent to reports of anti-social behaviour.ldquoThe PCSP will continue to work in partnership with the PSNI to ensure that warden patrols are appropriately deployed across the Newry, Mourne and Down District Council area where reports of anti-social behaviour have been received..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Fond.jpg","title":"Fond farewell to council chief  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council have bade farewell to their retiring chief executive, Mr Liam Hannaway.The celebratory event, which was hosted by council chairman Charlie Casey took place last Tuesday at Killeavy Castle, near Newry.Paying tribute on the evening, Cllr Casey reflected on Mr Hannawayrsquos many years in public service and his dedication to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.He said: ldquoLiam has spent  years in public service.

We will eventually cover all old estates, subject to continuing funds and satisfactory contracts.Movements have already been made with the awarding of a number of pre-paint repair contracts and work on all contracts should begin by March or April next year.More programmes of maintenance work are being prepared and will be starting in the - financial year, subject to the approval of the Executiversquos Board.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Uncertainty has surrounded the recent proposals to establish units for educationally sub-normal pupils at Castlewellan.The South Eastern Education and Library Board give approval in January for two new units to be set up at the local controlled primary school.However, plans were revised when the neighbouring school, St Malachyrsquos Primary, decided it wanted to have special ESN units.Board officers decided thatan ESN unit is established at St Malachyrsquos the demand for ESN facilities at Castlewellan Primary mightand therefore only one unit might be necessary at each school.But confusion arose when the Board placed advertisements in a local newspaper about the plans to establish the units.Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, was unsure about whether or not the Board had changed its policy and was intended to establish the units at St Malachyrsquos instead of at the controlled school.Mrs Smyth, who has raised the matter on several occasions, told Board members, this week that she was aggrieved about the whole affair and thought that Board officers had acted in a ldquovery surreptitious manner.ldquoThis sort of thing raises suspicions in the community and itrsquos just not good enough,: said Mrs Smyth.However, she was assured by Board chairman, Mr Cecil Kirkwood, that Board officers had not acted in an underhand manner and that there had only been a misunderstanding.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Killyleagh priest had called this week for people to follow the example of friendship shown by more than  Protestants and Roman Catholics who joined together in a special Halloween dinner and concert organised by his church.He is Fr Hugh OrsquoHagan and he was speaking hours after  senior citizens had enjoyed a dinner and concert in St Maryrsquos Hall, organised by the hall management committee.Speaking afterwards Fr OrsquoHagan said that Killyleagh and Shrigley had a unique community, ldquo everywhere has like here, Northern Ireland would be a more peaceful place.Invitations to Thursdayrsquos dinner and concert went out to both sides of the community and Fr OrsquoHagan stressed that he hoped no senior citizen had been forgotten, either Protestant or Roman Catholic.The idea of the dinner mdash which was such a success last year, when he was held for the first time mdash has been widely praised in the town, especially by the senior citizens and Thursday nightrsquos was no exception, with many voting it a big hit.Before the dinner began, Fr OrsquoHagan mdash who has been priest in Killyleagh for over  years and who is the longest serving priest ever in the town mdash welcomed everyone and thanked them for coming.He welcomed especially, the three ministers in the town, the Rev J C Boggs, Rev J D Mark and Rev R E Conn.

would follow the lead by NHS England and make Cystic Fibrosisdrugs Orkbambi, Symkevi and Kalydeco available to eligible patients.It is hoped that their two year-old son, Lorcaacuten, and other CF sufferers will be offered the drugs within weeks.The initial cost of a yearrsquos supply of the drug was estimated at pound, per patient.Last night Jen told the Recorder that she and her husband were ldquoecstatic but the news still has sunk in after they were called to a meeting with Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengelly at Stormont.The surprise announcement came as the couple were preparing to import the generic drug from South America as part of a CF Buyers Club of families.In a desperate attempt to start their son on the drug as quickly as possible, the couple and their family fundraised around pound, to buy Lorcaacuten three months treatment.ldquoWe were so close to getting the generic drug ourselves and that would have been great as Lorcaacuten would have started on it, but we would have still been campaigning and pushing for it, said Jen.ldquoWe have been told that the Department of Health want to copy what NHS England did and get the drug into peoplersquos hands within  days, starting rightly so, with those most in need.The mother of two admitted that living with Lorcaacutenrsquos condition and knowing that there was a drug that could dramatically improve his quality of le was ldquoabsolutely horrendous.ldquoIn many ways we feel that Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy has been stolen from us, Jen said of her first child who was diagnosed at  days

believes that Lorcaacuten will be on the drug before Christmas and recognises this as a gt of le.ldquoItrsquos not that this is just a good Christmas present but that we have actually been given extra Christmases with our son, said Jen.ldquoOne of the models for the drugs suggest thatyou start it at age six, you can have an extra  years on top of the normal le expectancy for a CF sufferer. ldquoItrsquos like we have been given  Christmases with Lorcaacuten, that it what it really means to us.Lorcaacuten currently needs two sessions of physio each day and uses a nebuliser five times a day along with  tables to absorb fat from his food.He has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last Christmas.Jen said: ldquoHopefully, by taking the drugs, it will mean that will be the end of the infection and he wonrsquot get other infections.ldquoIt gives us even more time to keep him healthy until the better drugs come along.The  year-old has been one of the most vocerous

true for singer Mark McMullan, who has just landed himself the lead role in a major touring production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.Mark will follow in the footsteps of Jason Donovan and Philip Schofield who played Joseph when he takes to the stage in Doncaster for a five-month tour from December .The role is Markrsquos first major performance in a national stage musical and will feature classic songs such as Any Dream Will Do and Close Every Door To Me.Such success has been long on the cards for the Crossgar man who distinguished himself as one of the upcoming stars in local musicals with the St Patrickrsquos Choral Society in Downpatrick.Mark has been a constant help and support to his older brother, Declan, and parents John and Brenda after Declan suffered a

Declan has lived with locked-in syndrome ever since.A video of Mark singing Take Him Home from the musical Les Miserables to Declan went viral in , landing him a spot on The Nolan Show.The emotional rendition of the song, which touches Declan and his parents every time they hear it, and the simple story of the brothersrsquo love and devotion, led to further performances for Mark on RTE.However, it wasnrsquot until this June that he won hearts as the runner-up in Britainrsquos Got Talent.His performance wowed judge Simon Cowell who told him it was the best performance of the series.Despite losing out to  year-old Cha Pensioner Colin Thackery, Markrsquos showcase on the hit show led to musical producers noticing his talent and superb voice.The McMullan family managed to keep the exciting news quiet until last week.Father John explained: ldquoMark was approached by the producer several months ago but we couldnrsquot really say anything.

The choral society gave me a taste for musical theatre and my mum really pushed me to do it. It turned out that I just loved it, added the former pupil of St Colmcillersquos High School in Crossgar and Down High School, Downpatrick.Mark performed in every musical staged by the society until his final appearance in Sunset Bouled, with music from Andrew Lloyd Webber, at the Grand Opera House in .ldquoThat role was the hardest one I had ever done, as while I have had plenty of leading roles, it was one that had me on stage in a major theatre and for nearly every scene, just as I will have to do the same in Joseph, said Mark.While Declanrsquos illness undoubtedly shook the McMullan family to its core, Mark said that he believes some good has come out of it.ldquoBefore Declan took sick in , my dream was always to go and live and work in London and do musical theatre. Unfortunately when that happened I had to put that dream on hold.ldquoI never thought I would look at it again as I knew I had to help Declan and my family, but unwittingly, the bad thing that happened to Declan has actually helped me pursue that dream even more.ldquoHe is my biggest supporter, hersquos like my manager. I speak every night to my Mum and him and he wants to know everything.Mark will continue with his job as architect while living in Newcastle-upon-Tyne with his partner, Zoe Hunter, who he met while they were students at Down High, until he feels confident that a secure future lies ahead of him in musical theatre.ldquoIrsquom also doing a Masters degree in architecture so between work, studying and rehearsal, le is very busy at the moment, he added.Bill Kenwrightrsquos production of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webberrsquos musical will play in Doncaster from December  to January  before continuing its UK tour in Peterborough, Aylesbury, Wimbledon, Coventry, Bradford, Chesterfield and Sunderland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting on bypass plans  ","story":"ROADS issues topped the agenda during a meeting in Downpatrick last week including progress on the multi-million pound Ballynahinch bypass scheme.South Down MP Chris Hazzard led a Sinn Fein delegation which met with senior Department of Infrastructure officials at Rathkeltair House.The MP was joined by South Down MLAs Emma Rogan and Sinead Ennis and councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Cathy Mason and Willie Clarke.Mr Hazzard said roads officials provided the delegation with a detailed overview of the local situation, including the impact of successive government austerity budgets on the departmentrsquos ability to maintain the network, invest in much-needed new public transport infrastructure and deliver the appropriate winter service in the months ahead.The MP said that despite the dficult operational environment, it was pleasing to hear that the roads department is continuing to deliver much-needed improvements, including progressing with the final legal stages of the Ballynahinch bypass.It was also confirmed that work is continuing on congestion alleviation schemes in Downpatrick and much-needed road safety enhancements in Mayobridge.ldquoWe also discussed the imminent public inquiry of the vitally important A junctions scheme, perhaps the highest priority local roads scheme given the huge road safety advantages that scheme is likely to deliver and the Newry southern relief road, said the MP.ldquoI was also pleased to hear roads officials speak passionately about delivering a number of park and ride facilities that will help meet the growing demand for modern, fit-for-purpose public transport options in the local area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th October 2019 Niall.jpg","title":"Niall backs start up loans plan  ","story":"THE founder of a Castlewellan business which makes an intelligent outdoor storage solution has been chosen to champion UK start-ups by the government-backed Start-Up Loans programme.Niall Greenan from The Smart Bunker was one of  business founders honoured at a reception at Westminster last week to celebrate some of the UKrsquos most successful small businesses.The Smart Bunker is an easy-to-use dispensing system which releases coal with a simple pull of a lever to fill the bucket to the required amount that can be carried.Mr Greenan , came up with the idea when he realised how dficult it was for his mother, who has arthritis, to fill a coal bucket from her traditional coal bin.He used a pound, Start-Up Loan to develop the device, which has gone on to win several awards.Mr Greenan has also expanded The Smart Bunker to include safe storage of wood pellets, ice treatment and animal feed.The product has attracted attention for its sustainability credentials, providing a good alternative to the plastic bags usually usedfor agricultural storage.

The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I owe my family a huge debt of gratitude for allowing me, without ever a word of reproach, to spend so much time at Westminster they understood how much joy and satisfaction I had from working on behalf of others.“Now, however, my priorities for the next few years are to spend my time at home in Northern Ireland to see more of my family and to step back from the frontline of public le.”She added: “I should like to thank the many constituents and others from across Northern Ireland who have contacted me directly to offer their support and encouragement to stand again for re-election. All such messages are deeply appreciated, and I apologise most sincerely for any disappointment caused by my decision not to stand.“To all those volunteers who have given so generously of their time to help me in previous Westminster elections, I should also like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the streets walked and leaflets delivered. They made canvassing fun, despite the rain and wind we often had to endure.“Last, but certainly not least, I wish to thank the wonderful staff who have worked alongside me since I was first elected. Their loyalty, friendship and hard work lightened my load, and definitely sustained me through those years.“If my successor enjoys the role of MP for North Down half as much as I have done, a smile will constantly be on his or her face.”Lady Hermon said she would be making no further statement.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, we got Frank Collict, a local artist in to do another card - this time a painting of Penarth Pier in the snow.All the profits from the cards go to the Tabernacle Church foodbank.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the prospect of one of the industryrsquos most beloved stars being digitally resurrected was met with widespread criticism after the news was first reported by the Hollywood Reporter.Captain America actor Chris Evans was among those who called the plans disrespectful and wrongheaded.ldquoMaybe we can get a computer to paint us a new Picasso. Or write a couple new John Lennon tunes, Evans said on Twitter.ldquoThe complete lack of understanding here is shameful.Rights to Deanrsquos likeness were acquired by the filmmakers and the production company Magic City Films through CMG Worldwide. The company represents Deanrsquos family along with the intellectual property rights associated with many other deceased personalities including Neil Armstrong, Bette Davis and Burt Reynolds.Mark Roesler, chairman and chief executive of CMG, defended the use of Dean and said the company has represented his family for decades.Noting that Dean has more than , followers on Instagram, Mr Roesler said the star still resonates today.ldquoJames Dean was known as Hollywoodrsquos rebel and he famously said lsquo a man can bridge the gap between le and death,he can live after hersquos died, then maybe he was a great man.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth. APCOA Parking Group has almost  years of industry expertise. With its , employees, the company manages approximately . million inidual parking spaces at more than , locations in  European countries. These include parking spaces at , city and shopping centre locations,  hotels,  hospitals and  European airports.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/WEB2.jpg","title":"danske bank the top team shaping the future","story":"Posted on Tuesday November  by Ulster Business Kevin Kingston, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett speak to John Mulgrew Danske Bank has made a big move in creating two deputy chief executiveroles to help boost business, engagement and further bolster a strong public face for the organisation. Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change.
