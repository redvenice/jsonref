Mr Mackinlay and his wife Kati, pictured  in Ramsgate, Kent, during the 2015 election\u0027Of any seat in the country, this would be the one looked at and pored over very carefully,\u0027 he said.He insisted he had little control over spending and described a \u0027battle bus\u0027 of volunteers drafted in by Conservative Party HQ as a \u0027total waste of time\u0027.\u0027I was just a small cog in a big gearbox,\u0027 he added.Little, 63, of Ware in Hertfordshire, was found guilty of two counts of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007 but cleared of a third count.Seasoned campaigner Little, who has worked for the party since 1974, was sent from central office to help run the campaign and was convicted by majority verdict of two counts of encouraging or assisting an offence.Election spending is tightly controlled over two stages, known as a short and a long campaign.

The tips form part of an advice sheet released today by the Guide in advance of the deadline for applying for a primary school next Tuesday (stock image)‘Bright children can feel very frustrated if they don’t get challenging work,’ she explained.‘If behaviour in the class is poor, well-behaved kids can get neglected. Very able or “odd” kids can get bullied.’Mrs Coatman said a ‘safe bet’ school would be one with a large intake which has in previous years accepted children living a similar distance away.She also warned: ‘Ambitious parents think a school that isn’t “outstanding” or “good” wouldn’t be worth considering - but there are several outstanding schools that haven’t been inspected for over a decade.’She advised parents missing out on all their choices to accept the first school offered, then sign up to the waiting lists of their chosen schools.‘Try not to let on to your child how much you hate the school at which they’ve been given a place.

There would be nothing Parliament could do.’ Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a no-confidence motion is passed, there is a 14 day period in which the government - or a new administration - can try to establish a majority again.If a confidence motion is not passed by MPs during that time then an election is triggered.But the legislation sets out that the date of the national ballot will be \u0027the day appointed by Her Majesty by proclamation on the recommendation of the Prime Minister\u0027.The minister pointed out that, while Parliament is dissolved for 17 working days during a campaign, the government still exists, and the civil service can still carry out pre-existing policies. Asked what Mrs May should do if ministers opt to quit, they said: ‘Say bye bye. \u0027The Brexiteers who didn’t agree with the policy quit. They should do the same.’           Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd (pictured at No10 yesterday) has warned a government that pushed through no-deal would not be forgiven    Tory Dominic Grieve (left) and Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper (right) are among the MPs who have joined forces to try to head off the possibility of a no-deal BrexitThe Cabinet minister added that they believed Mrs May was committed to making Brexit happen.‘The PM has not shown any signs of wavering so far,’ they said.A crucial Commons debate will resume later today on the Prime Minister\u0027s blueprint - paving the way for a titanic showdown next week that could define the country\u0027s future.But the walls are closing in on Mrs May after an alliance of Labour and Conservative rebels inflicted an historic defeat on the flagship Finance Bill - the first time that has happened for four decades.The amendment will curb the Treasury\u0027s tax-raising powers if the government tries to force a no deal Brexit, with rebels insisting they will wage \u0027guerrilla warfare\u0027 to stop the UK crashing out without an agreement. The Cabinet is also deeply split on how to proceed if Mrs May\u0027s package is killed off, with figures such as Amber Rudd and Greg Clark adamant that no-deal should not be contemplated, while others such as Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Andrea Leadsom are thought to regard it as preferable to no Brexit.Mrs May - who has insisted she will not delay the Brexit date from the end of March - has effectively admitted the EU has not given her any new concessions by resuming the debate she delayed last month, rather than tabling a fresh motion.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Girl wearing VR headset runs straight wall drops grenade California","story":"    A girl wearing a virtual reality headset runs head-first into a wall after dropping a grenade in her friend\u0027s game          She tentatively holds the sensor pads while listening to instructions from her friends          The girl then accidentally tosses a grenade at her own feet while playing the firs-person shooterVirtual reality can make you a better person: Study finds...Share this articleRicardo Gonhin had invited his female friend round to try out his VR games for the first time.Another woman could be seen helping the girl put the headset on and placing the sensor controllers in her hands.The man and woman try to coach her through playing the game.

In Byzantine times, the historian Eusebius said that Kirjathjearim was nine or ten miles west of Jerusalem, which this site is.\u0027Also the name of the hill in Arabic – Deir el-Azar – preserves the name of the Byzantine monastery: the Monastery of Elazar.\u0027According to the Book of Samuel, Elazar was the priest in charge of the Ark.\u0027Along with his colleagues, Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicoll of the College de France, Professor Finkelstein has been digging at Kiryat Ye\u0027arim since August 2017 as part of the Shmunis Family Excavation.And though he has found no evidence of the Ark itself, he believes he can shed some light on its true nature.          Professor Finkelstein of Tel Aviv University is leading the dig at the site along with other experts          The colossal structure is not the final resting place of the lost Ark but thought to be a temple which lends vital clues as to why the narrative was constructed          The site of the temple platform in the steppes above what is now the modern Israeli town of Kiryat Ye\u0027arimKirjathjearim straddled the border of two ancient kingdoms – Israel to the north and Judah to the south – with excavations suggesting the site was used by the former to control the latter.Against this backdrop, Professor Finkelstein believes the Ark story was invented to give Kirjathjearim religious legitimacy as an administrative centre.It also emphasises a fabled past when the two kingdoms were united under a single ruler, further legitimising ancient Israel\u0027s rule over its southern neighbour.\u0027We are not searching for the Ark,\u0027 he said. \u0027We are trying to understand the Ark Narrative: who composed it, when and why.\u0027The biblical narrative probably comes from the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and was seemingly composed in the first half of the 8th century BC.\u0027It probably served the ideological goals of the kingdom at the time, perhaps also its territorial aspirations, namely control over Judah.\u0027Lending weight to this theory is a huge platform discovered at the site.          Moses and Joshua bowing before the Ark of the Covenant, which was believed to be kept at the ancient site of Kirjathjearim          The ancient and sacred site of Kirjathjearim is believed by historians to be the located in the same place as the modern Israeli town of Kiryat Ye\u0027arim          The archaeologists believe their discovery of a colossal temple platform lends weight to their theories about the biblical narrative and why the Ark of the Covenant was said to have been located thereProfessor Finkelstein said: \u0027Kirjathjearim was a typical hill country town, on a peak, with relatively steep slopes.\u0027But on the summit there was an elevated platform, which was probably the location of a temple.\u0027He believes Judah was too weak to have constructed the platform itself and thinks the likeliest builder was the occupying Northern Kingdom.If he\u0027s right, it would prove the kingdom\u0027s influence over the site.Biblical tradition says that the Ark was eventually brought from Kirjathjearim to Jerusalem, but disappeared when the city was destroyed by Babylonians in the sixth century BC.Its whereabouts have been the subject of speculation since, with some saying it may have been melted down for gold, hidden on Mount Nebo, Jordan, or even taken to Africa.The site is rumoured to have been the inspiration behind the 1981 blockbuster, Raiders of the Lost Ark."},{"url":null,"title":"Woman married man said planned bin Laden raid","story":"Liar, liar: Abby Ellin\u0027s fiance told her jaw-dropping tales of covert missions for the CIA and being the medical director for Guantanamo - and at first she believed him          Telling tales: The journalist, pictured here with former US President Bill Clinton at an event to support his wife Hillary\u0027s Senate bid several years ago, fell for the US Navy doctor after their first date in 2010, and moved in with him in Washington DCMs Ellin, who has now written a book about her experience called Duped, first encountered the man in 2006 when she needed a medical expert for an article, and called him at his private practice in Los Angeles.  Ex-wife drove while three times the limit to get away from...Dr. Phil tells DailyMail.com all about his new podcast Phil...The midlife crisis isn\u0027t real!

Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University.

If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work!

In one south London bookshop, the owner has put a sign in the window advising that yes, they do have copies of Sally Rooney’s Normal People, the literary phenomenon of the year.This week, Rooney, 27, became the youngest novelist ever to land the Costa awards’ best novel category. Normal People is now favourite to win the prize for overall book of the year at the end of the month. Her second novel has been a surprise – not for its quality, which was assured after her confident debut Conversations with Friends – but for the response to it. There hasn’t been a literary novel that has had such an impact on conversation beyond the usual huddles of luvvies since perhaps Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom, or, before that, Monica Ali’s Brick Lane, or even before that, Zadie Smith’s White Teeth.Booksellers have said they are keeping a stash behind the counter, putting them in the hands of customers before they can even blurt: “Do you have …” Not that they mind it Waterstones staff named it as their favourite book to recommend last year, while one Hatchards bookseller says it was the first book the chain had began to see more commonly sold in multiples, to people eager to share it with friends. I was buying three copies at the time.So why has it become the novel of the moment – and, arguably, the decade? Normal People is a quiet, literary novel – but it is a zeitgeist novel too (despite being set five years ago). It’s hard not to emerge from Rooney’s book about two young people navigating adulthood in post-crash Ireland and sense that, somehow, the author has spotted something intangible about our time and exposed it. Like other zeitgeist novels, from Gone With the Wind, when mass-fiction began booming in the 1930s, to Franzen’s post 911 tome Freedom, Normal People has trapped a moment – in this case, our new sense of collective precariousness – whether inidual, economic or political.It is the first novel I have read that has convincingly captured what it is to be young today: often overeducated, neurotic, slightly too self-aware. So much can be read into the aspiration of the male character Connell to one day “start going to dinner parties and having conversations about the Greek bailout” – a dream for a young man with preconceived ideas about what successful adults do. Or, indeed, to fellow protagonist Marianne’s sense that “her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it”.“Hysterical realism” was the name the critic James Wood once gave to the mid-2000s boom of novels ostensibly deliberately setting out to capture the moment. He was not a fan of novels he saw as overstuffed with symbolism and real world events. But what Rooney does differently from Ian McEwan’s Saturday (the Iraq war) or Zadie Smith’s White Teeth (multiculturalism and globalisation) is to ensure it never feels like a lesson.The most compelling question the novel poses is, simply: will Marianne and Connell eventually be happy? In one scene in Normal People, Connell is so engrossed by Jane Austen’s Emma that he loses track of time and, leaving the library, he marvels: “It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him.” There it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0e1eb9c467f5e72880cbd96f10bef044074a26/67_0_2692_1616/master/2692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094d071b0d2fba5d0479e870678ed238","title":"the orchid and the dandelion by w thomas boyce review","story":"Are you sensitive or resilient? This study by a paediatric health expert considers why children with the greatest potential are also the ones most likely to falterSome people seem to have terrible childhoods and yet manage to thrive despite them. Others grow up in loving homes but suffer from mental and physical health difficulties, even if their siblings do not. Why?The first variable you would expect to account for these differences is whether the child comes from a prosperous or a poor background. It’s true, children from poorer backgrounds suffer slightly more illnesses and show more signs of psychological disturbance, but socioeconomic factors by no means account for all children who are in that fifth of the population who suffer half the illnesses. Whether a child blossoms or falters is driven wholly neither by environment nor by genetics, but by the interplay between the two. In this book, paediatric health expert W Thomas Boyce identifies two personality types. He argues that four fifths of children appear to be “dandelions”, who can thrive in most environments. The remaining fifth are “orchids”, who are more exquisite and unusual and have a higher potential than dandelions – but for this to be realised they require a particular environment and careful gardening. Like delicate plants, these children, if dealt with insensitively, have a greater tendency to run into problems.How do you tell if a child is an orchid? They tend to be sensitive, shy, have negative emotional reactions to novel or changing conditions, and perhaps display challenging behaviour. But these symptoms cannot be taken as proof that a child will necessarily respond in a certain way to tests and show a high stress biological reaction to an external stressor. The symptoms are only correlations, they can only indicate that it is likely.Boyce and his team test the biological stress response in children by setting various tasks such as watching an emotional video, having to repeat a string of numbers back to the researcher and having a drop of lemon juice put on the tongue and being asked to say what that was like. Although the experiment is scripted, and the researchers who test the children are all warm towards their subjects, how much cortisol (a stress hormone) and how much their autonomic nervous system (flight-or-fight response) is stimulated varies enormously, though in a predictable way. Time and time again, about four fifths of subjects show low levels of biological stress in these tests, and a fifth exhibit significantly higher stress levels. The children who show the higher stress response often have a slightly warmer right ear when their temperatures are taken, while others often have a slightly warmer left ear. Again, these differences in ear temperature can only indicate a possibility, not a certainty.When children are tested after a stressful time, such as a family breakup, an earthquake or a different change in environment a pattern emerges. If orchids get the right nurturing, sufficient soothing and opportunities for self-expression – in other words, an environment that allows their sensitivities to work for them – they come out on top, higher than the dandelions. But if their environment works against them, they sink to the bottom, below the more robust dandelions who are less affected by their environment. The take-home message of the book is: orchid children are more susceptible to both negative and positive social conditioning they have both the best outcomes and the worst.Boyce tells the story of himself and his sister: he the dandelion, she the orchid. Not being so susceptible to the sometimes critical atmosphere of their childhood home, he went on to excel, whereas her early promise was confounded by physical and mental illnesses – she killed herself when she was 53. With hindsight, he can see that he was only slightly troubled by, say, his parents fighting, whereas she was immobilised with fear, frozen and traumatised by it. He believes a more sensitive, nurturing environment would have allowed her confidence and obvious talents to blossom and her story to have had a happier outcome.This is a necessary and important book. To know that one fifth of people do not have a choice about how they physically react to stress should make us more understanding of the differences between us all. Children should be nurtured so that both orchids and dandelions can thrive. But I worry about how the orchid and dandelion theory might be employed. The danger of putting people into categories is that we unwittingly respond not to the person, but to their label.• Phillippa Perry’s The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read will be published by Penguin Life in March.

Greggs made a pretax profit of £81.8m in 2017.Greggs has prided itself on adapting products to suit changing consumer tastes, and said its latest creation, the £1 vegan sausage roll, was proving popular with “a broad range of customers”.The vegan sausage roll hit Greggs’ shelves last week, coinciding with the beginning of Veganuary, a growing movement that encourages people to embrace plant-based diets during January. It is on sale in 950 of Greggs’s 1,950 UK shops. Greggs has increased sales and profits despite a tough backdrop for high street retailers struggling with rising business costs, a switch to online spending and faltering consumer confidence as Brexit looms.Roger Whiteside, the firm’s chief executive, said: “We delivered a very strong finish to 2018 despite the well-publicised challenges in the consumer sector. This performance was broad-based, reflecting the strength of our range of freshly prepared food and drinks, and the strategic changes that we have made in recent years to focus more effectively on the food-on-the-go market.“In the year ahead, we will continue to innovate with products designed to reflect changing consumer tastes, and by opening in new locations that make Greggs even more accessible to customers.”The bakery chain opened 149 new shops in 2018 and closed 50. It now operates 1,953 outlets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7fed28ce880b5e52d730aa98687dc72cb401c4a/0_267_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d3462af1c712d66ff5dd0db88adae0","title":"like la with minarets how concrete and cars came to rule tehran","story":"The next 15 megacities #3: With nearly 10 million people doing daily battle with some of the world’s highest levels of congestion and air pollution, headscarves should be the least of the authorities’ worries …by  Oliver Wainwright in TehranTehran’s traffic jams have spawned a curious social phenomenon. The affluent car-driving youth of the northern districts have turned gridlock into a way of meeting members of the opposite sex.Known as “dor-dor” (“turn-turn” in Farsi), separate groups of young men and women drive around, pulling up alongside each other in congested traffic so they can flirt and pass phone numbers through the window. The cars are either all-girl or all-boy to avoid censorship by the Islamic morality police. If the police do show up they can make a (slow) getaway.By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.This furtive car-cruising is just one of the signs of youthful rebellion against draconian moral codes, and an indication that the Iranian capital might be becoming gradually more relaxed. In Ab-o-Atash park, a teenage girl in skinny jeans and rollerblades allows her headscarf to drop briefly as she coasts past a group of gawping boys. Nearby, a tape of religious music is drowned out by the blaring hip-hop coming from the skatepark. Gaggles of families pose for selfies, while black-cloaked women shuffle past on their way to the mosque.“We never had spaces like this when we were growing up here,” says a middle-aged woman visiting from Canada with her sister, where they have both lived for the past 20 years after moving from Iran. “Even a few years ago, a scene like this would have been unthinkable.”These visions of tolerance and mutual co-existence are a far cry from most foreigners’ preconceived images of Tehran – a place where religious law still forbids women from riding bicycles. On the new Tabiat pedestrian bridge, whose futuristic tendrils wind their way across the valley, young couples sit arm-in-arm, while groups of girls saunter past, their headscarves pulled so far back they seem to defy gravity. “If we’d been seen out with a boy like this,” adds one of the sisters, “we would have been forced to marry them.”This scene of apparent social freedom turns out to be precariously balanced. In 2011, a couple of years after the park opened, 10 people were arrested by the morality police after holding a water fight in the fountains. Two years ago, an extra 7,000 morality police were introduced in Tehran, specifically to monitor the strict hijab rules, targeting everything from loose-fitting headscarves and shortened trousers for women, to glamorous hairstyles and necklaces for men. Given the capital’s population explosion the authorities face an uphill struggle. From the decks of Tabiat bridge, evening crowds – suspended above the bumper-to-bumper traffic of an eight-lane highway – admire the sunset through a thick haze of smog. Cranes stretch to the horizon, conjuring ever taller concrete towers which march incessantly into the surrounding hills.Tehran’s population now numbers around 8.4 million people in the city proper, swelling to 14 million in the wider metropolitan region, making it the most populous city in western Asia. It is set to join the global ranks of megacities by 2035, according to forecasts from the UN, with its residents passing the 10 million mark in 2028.But Tehran is a city on the brink. With some of the world’s highest levels of congestion, air pollution, water shortages, land subsidence and eye-watering costs of living, headscarves should be the least of the authorities’ worries.Stuck in traffic on one of Tehran’s interminable freeways, the city can feel like Los Angeles with minarets. The similarity is no coincidence: its modern urban structure was laid out by America’s own doyen of postwar sprawl, Victor Gruen. The godfather of the suburban shopping mall was hired by the Iranian government in 1966 to masterplan the future of the capital, and plotted a web of highways that would thread their way through the undulating topography, connecting a dispersed network of neighbourhoods separated by lush green valleys. The model was typical of American new towns – only adapted to the foothills of the Alborz mountains.It was part of a wave of projects resulting from the American government’s deep engagement with the ruling Pahlavi dynasty. Come the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the masterplan embodied everything that the new regime stood against: it was the detestable legacy of the Shah writ large across the city. Attempts to make a new plan were rejected by the city, so a decision was made to go on with the Gruen scheme, while gleefully rejecting many of its key principles.There has been a financial incentive behind the city’s expansion too. In the years following the revolution, the municipality realised that a handsome stream of income could be generated by allowing developers to breach the density limits set out in the masterplan in exchange for a substantial fee. Zoning laws were bent and construction permits issued. Revenues collected were then invested in major urban development projects, which in turn increased the value of real estate. The urban form of Tehran was built around a system of institutionalised bribery, which continues to this day.“Anyone can pay a fine and build a high-rise,” says Masoud Taghavi, former editor of Iranian architecture magazine Hamshahri Memari. “There are some plans, but in most cases they’re being ignored. You see highways where they shouldn’t be, buildings where they shouldn’t be, shopping malls where they shouldn’t be.”The practice of selling density has led to an identikit form of residential development, with plots simply filled to their limits and extruded to maximise the saleable floor area. Most are designed without terraces or balconies and with minimal open space around them.The policy has also seen a proliferation of huge commercial buildings with little regard to their wider impact. As chairman of Tehran city council’s health and environment committee, Mohammad Haqqani, put it: “Tehran municipality is granting permits to almost all applicants wishing to construct commercial buildings like shopping malls and office buildings, without paying attention to the real needs of each district and the worsening traffic congestion in the sprawling capital.” Following a spate of high-end malls, a district in northern Tehran finally banned their construction last year. But it is too little too late.Many point the finger at Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, Iran’s former chief of police and several-time failed presidential candidate, who served as the mayor of Tehran from 2005 until 2017. He presided over a wealth of impressive-looking trophy projects which introduced a glossy image of modernity – but did little to tackle the city’s real problems.The expansion of the Sadr expressway was one of his most publicised achievements, seeing a three-mile long double-decker concrete highway erected in the north-east of the city. Articles on the project were greeted with comments such as “Long live Tehran’s master builder, the humble accomplisher, Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf,” and “May the eyes of the envious and extremist burst in jealousy.”Those eyes are now watering at the vast expense and unintended consequences of the grand plan, which has had the effect of increasing traffic and further cementing car as king. Members of the Tehran city council conceded last year that adequate research was not conducted before construction began, and that the elevated highway has failed to achieve its main purpose. “It is a disastrous project,” says architect and urbanist Ahmadreza Hakiminejad. “It was hailed as a way of reducing Tehran’s congestion, but it has had the opposite result. If you make more room for cars, you get more cars on the street. More cars means more congestion and more pollution.”All schools in the capital were forced to close one day last year due to the dangerous levels of toxic particles in the air. Pollution causes an annual 20,000 deaths, according to deputy health minister Alireza Raeisi, a statistic that has even prompted the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to weigh in: it is now religiously forbidden to drive vehicles in such high levels of pollution without valid rationale. Ghalibaf put his efforts into applying a thin layer of decoration across Tehran in an attempt to ert people’s attention from its day-to-day dysfunction. The Bureau of Beautification was established to oversee a campaign of murals, bollard paintings and curious sculptures. A stretch of Valiasr Street now has a sculpture garden along one side, where a number of dead trees have been adorned with artwork to disguise the fact they’re stricken due to lack of water. Bus stops have been decorated and novelty benches commissioned – but nothing has changed beneath the surface.Hakiminejad says the beautification campaign and the Sadr expressway are just two of innumerable ill-conceived schemes conducted over the last decade, along with policies that have seen the trampling of the city’s little remaining green space. Over the past decade, around 4,000 hectares of Tehran’s former gardens have been destroyed by the so-called “garden tower” act, which allows people to build high-rises on garden land.Other grand visions, like the satellite development around the artificial Chitgar Lake to the north-west of Tehran, have similarly backfired. The lake has been accused of erting much-needed flows of water from the city, while the surrounding plots have been sold off in the usual fashion, spawning a grim forest of high-rise towers and malls. There are few of the facilities such as schools that a functioning new urban centre needs.“It’s yet another ‘wow’ project, designed more as a tourist attraction than an extension of the city,” says Hakiminejad. “It’s going to end up being a vertical slum.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6eccfd3814bbdcf44232b118257ecc876163e8/0_2880_3202_1920/master/3202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3da69955da61c200ae6b2c92196f9c25","title":"concrete city beauty los angeles in pictures","story":"LA is a city of concrete.

Maybe it can work the other way aroundImperial College London is including cookery lessons in its chemistry degree courses, starting this September. The Introduction to Culinary Practice module, created in collaboration with the chef Jozef Youssef from the Basque Culinary Centre, will allow students to “experience the ambiguities and challenges of translating written instructions into action” (AKA “following a recipe”). There are several reasons why I think this is a great idea, only some of which hold academic weight.I met Youssef several years ago, and he is one of the most absurdly good-looking men I have ever set eyes upon. He looks like a young Antonio Banderas had sex with a Magimix in Zorro’s kitchen. His science-theory-inflected food is extraordinary, too. At the tasting menu I attended, we ate origami pasta, oyster ice-cream and fossilised squash. One course was based on a Mexican folk tale and there was a mushroom dish based around the scent of petrichor. I was like a kid in a candy store. Not a real candy store, obviously, a virtual one, with piped custard aromas and implanted happy memories. Molecular gastronomy gets a bad rap from traditional food critics, seen as “all fur coat, no knickers”, but it’s right up my street. Spherification, emulsions, foams, there’s a Roald Dahl-esque theatre to this type of food that I love.Another good sign is that the professor of surgical education and engagement science who spearheaded the changes is called Roger Kneebone. I hope that’s not one of the techniques he has pioneered. Is there anyone who doesn’t feel their purpose on Earth bolstered by such a delightful piece of nominative determinism? I wonder if the years of hearing bad jokes have broken him. Anyway, his involvement guarantees the course’s success. It’s meant to be.Is cooking really educational? It’s not a trivial question. According to Kneebone, the thigh bone’s connected – no, hold on. According to Kneebone, many surgical students spend so much time on screens that they have lost the dexterity to stitch patients. OkayOK, he does sound a little bit broken. The idea behind this course is that the practical skills required by cooking will be invaluable to a new generation of scientists. And I believe that’s true. Just look at The Great British Bake Off: some of its best contestants, such as Rahul Mandal and Andrew Smyth, make brownies with a set square.Cooking is one of the best teachers I’ve known. Not only has it kept me sane and healthy, it has also got me more interested in the science of food and its preparation, despite being a chemistry brain-dud who thought an ionic bond was a Greek spy. Through cooking, I became interested in Maillard reactions and nasal receptors, fermentation, the hydrophilic-hydrophobic magic of egg yolks, denaturing proteins and the vibrational spectra of courgettes. There’s no reason this wouldn’t work the other way around – that booksmart students can’t develop their powers of observation, adaptation and hands-on ability by making chips or turning out a spotted dick.The university has indicated that, as part of the module, the students will have access to research instruments such as centrifuges, rotary evaporators and sonic homogenisers just picturing these God-level gadgets has me breaking out in excitement hives. It’s great these chemistry undergraduates will be bettering our understanding of the world and if that dream collapses like a soufflé, they will still have some great transferable skills. They could open an organic vegetarian restaurant, called Stems. No? Jeez, you get more of a reaction from helium. Thank you, I’m here all week.

The darker politics that was mixed in with the mainstream leave vote no longer feels the need to hide. On Monday, Anna Soubry, Owen Jones and I were confronted by it. But those who verbally attacked and physically harassed us do not speak for ordinary leave voters or the disadvantaged. They have nothing to do with the pro-Brexit protesters, with whom I respectfully disagree.I’ve encountered them before talking to people around the country is what I do. I’ve engaged with them at People’s Vote marches in Sunderland and outside parliament. I even attended a rally led by the English Defence League’s so-called Tommy Robinson. A figure close to Robinson admitted to me (believing I was pro Brexit) that they knew Brexit would make the country poorer. Knowingly going ahead with a policy that leaves desperately squeezed people even worse off is a betrayal of those they claim to represent.These far-right groups go to the most neglected parts of the country, like Sunderland, and prey on existing frustrations with a London-centric political system that has left them behind. And instead of pushing to address regional inequality and the democratic powerlessness created by our constituency-based voting system, they point the finger at minorities and the EU. And now that leaving the EU hasn’t worked out, they seek to silence any national dialogue about what to do about it.I’m not afraid of these sad few men in their hi-vis jackets, ironically copying a movement that started in France. But I am afraid they will define what constitutes acceptable debate around Brexit. It would be a disaster if we let the shape of UK democracy and dialogue be fixed by the demands of thugs.The abuse and threatening behaviour of these iniduals around parliament is unacceptable. And it isn’t just heckling. In this instance, a group of men surrounded an MP. Some iniduals in that group aggressively shouted abuse in her face, then appeared to physically block her from entering parliament (her place of work).Plenty of people around the country are frustrated with the Brexit process – and all but a tiny minority continue to engage in reasonable democratic debate. This debate is absolutely crucial given the vastly different and country-defining options the UK faces. We must be able to have it without feeling like some options are unacceptable because a tiny minority of people are willing to go further, and shout louder, than everyone else. The answer to the far right cannot be to give in. We have never, and will never, let them dictate the terms of debate. When they argue for less democracy, we must call for more.I disagree vehemently with Jacob Rees-Mogg. But when far-left activists went to his house and verbally attacked him in front of his children, that was wrong. When Julia Hartley-Brewer, with whom I regularly argue on the radio, receives abuse on Twitter, I defend her. Because there’s a key difference between intense political discourse and gratuitous abuse, no matter where you are on the spectrum.That’s why I’m constantly calling out those on my side who label all Brexit voters uneducated, as if remainers are all experts in EU law. I also criticise those who label all Brexit voters racist, as if one needs to be racist to follow the advice of senior politicians that Brexit would help the NHS. These blanket accusations aren’t just factually wrong, they mean that when we encounter real racism, we won’t be taken seriously – when a prominent figure within the group shouted “You ain’t even **** British” at a BAME police officer, for example.The silver lining of this mess is that we can now identify those who sow ision and hatred, isolate them and make a real effort to listen to and address the concerns of ordinary Brexit voters.• Femi Oluwole is chief spokesperson for Our Future, Our Choice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb45419af84d73c978c2d2925934eb75e5707378/0_239_5579_3347/master/5579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16f3eceb8013f44659ec00f0b743c98d","title":"oxford cambridge colleges state school students","story":"The worst mistakes come from perpetuating failure, hoping it will be different next time while doing nothing different. So it is with the imperative to broaden social access to Oxford and Cambridge universities.What’s needed now is a revolutionary but achievable policy, and here it is. Oxford and Cambridge should establish new colleges focusing exclusively on “access with excellence”, in the tradition of Oxbridge colleges set up for women and recently persecuted religious minorities in the 19th century.These colleges would significantly increase the number of places available for students from schools and families without an Oxbridge tradition. Over time, they might also transform the culture of the two universities.Access statistics and initiatives at Oxbridge have been stuck in a groove for two generations now, since the end of the old state grammar school system. There is much noise but only marginal change. Worse, there is a determination by those in charge at Oxford and Cambridge not to change fundamentally while pretending to do so.The Sutton Trust, an access charity, published statistics last month showing that eight elite schools send more students to Oxbridge each year than nearly 3,000 state schools and colleges. The schools include the £32,000-a-year Eton and Westminster. By contrast, many of the 3,000 send not a single student to Oxbridge, year after year, and are concentrated in deprived and isolated communities like Rochdale, Sunderland and Weymouth, where Oxford and Cambridge may as well be Saturn and Mars.Oxbridge vice-chancellors and admissions tutors prattle on about “widening access”. But it doesn’t happen, beyond a marginal shift over decades, driven by the constant focus on statistics on the overall private and state school share of places, which favours teenagers from the remaining 160 state grammar schools and the most successful state schools.And it is never going to happen within the existing system. Educational standards are so high at “top” private and state schools and colleges that nothing short of quotas and banning orders will bring about transformational change. Even in my most radical moods, I couldn’t support such a policy and nor is it fair or wise to force highly able private school pupils to leave Britain and buy their way into the best American and private European universities.This is not just a function of “top” schools being superlative at achieving top GCSE and A-level grades for their students. The overall quality of their teaching and education – including their music, sport, drama and social activities – is generally world class.The right response is to significantly expand the number of Oxbridge places available for the brightest teenagers from the 3,000 “non-Oxbridge” state schools and colleges, which make up about three-quarters of all schools and colleges. The way to do this is to set up a new generation of “access” colleges within Oxford and Cambridge focused exclusively on the young people from the “missing 3,000” schools and colleges.Allocating the extra places by means of new colleges, rather than more places at existing colleges, would give an exclusive focus on these schools and colleges without debilitating debates about distributional fairness and existing practice in “traditional” colleges. It would promote radical, not incremental, change, even as the overall addition in the number of places would be necessarily incremental. As well as the 1,000 or more additional places available each year, the new colleges will be exemplars of best practice in recruiting students from schools without an Oxbridge tradition.It also goes with the grain of the college system, which dominates both of our ancient universities. My college – Keble, Oxford – was founded in 1870 with a comparable missionary zeal, in its case to serve the Anglo-Catholic movement that was a rising force in the mid-Victorian Church of England. Ultimately more transformational, but equally zealous, was the group of women’s colleges established in the same decade, revolutionising women’s university education and opportunities. A similar revolution took place in parallel at Cambridge.To make a success of the new colleges, the universities should recruit founders from the best of the new breed of school academy sponsors, like transformational education charities Ark and Harris. From practice and passion, they know what needs to be done. I would be keen to help to found one of these colleges myself. It is anyway long overdue for Oxford and Cambridge to establish some new colleges, after 30 years when virtually none have been set up but existing colleges have expanded to cater mainly for rising numbers of postgraduate students.The obvious objections are easily met. Will existing colleges object? Too bad. Will the new students be regarded as second-class? Only if they aren’t as good as the others. Might they not be as good? Give me a break. The idea that 3,000 state schools can’t produce a few hundred able Oxbridge students, with the right encouragement and extra support, is farcical. A century ago they said that about women.The most insidious objection, often unstated, comes from faux radicals. Why play to the idea that Oxbridge is the be all and end all, rather than boosting other, particularly local, universities instead? In my experience these faux radicals often turn out to have been to Oxbridge. Typically they also went to private school or a top state school. Instead, it is a case of “and” not “or”: we do need to boost good opportunities in all kinds of universities in all parts of the country, not just Oxbridge.Many leading figures in Oxford and Cambridge know the status quo is unjustifiable and unsustainable. They are waiting for a new approach.

It is “destructive of human character and relationships”, he wrote, because “it treats human sexual capacities in a way which is deeply hostile to the self-understanding of those members who are willing to commit themselves to real marriage”.Migration is another theme in his writing. In a paper published a decade ago, he wrote: “European states in the early 21st century move … into a trajectory of demographic and cultural decay … population transfer and replacement by a kind of reverse colonisation.” He warned of coming “ethnic and religious inter-communal miseries of hatred, bloodshed and political paralysis”.Finnis, who converted to Catholicism in 1962, has advised the Vatican and mentored the conservative US judge, Neil Gorsuch, who was appointed to the US supreme court by Donald Trump in 2017.The students’ petition calls for Finnis to be removed from teaching on the grounds that “university is a place to focus on education, not to be forced to campaign against or to be taught by professors who have promoted hatred towards students that they teach”.The students also want Oxford “to clarify its official position on professors who have expressed discriminatory views and behaved in discriminatory ways, especially those who have shown obvious hatred and intolerance”.Finnis told the Oxford Student: “I stand by all these writings. There is not a ‘phobic’ sentence in them. The 1994 essay promotes a classical and strictly philosophical moral critique of all non-marital sex acts and has been republished many times, most recently by Oxford University Press in the third volume of my Collected Essays.”Alex Benn, one of the authors of the petition, said Finnis had “built a career on demonisation. His so-called arguments about disadvantaged people are hateful, not to mention widely discredited”.Benn told the Oxford Student: “Campaigns like this one often receive simplistic responses calling for tolerance or academic freedom. But law, employment and education already draw boundaries about what won’t be tolerated.

Thanks to Colette, feline fans on Instagram have an almost endless supply of quotes for captions (“Our perfect companions never have fewer than four feet” is a personal favourite). The other accolade missing from that impressive CV? Style icon.Colette, born in 1873, came of age as photography became popularised. When the cheap and easy-to-use Kodak Brownie became available in 1900, she was 27 and already a personality in Paris.She was photographed in thinker’s pose at her desk in a polka dot blouse lounging with two cats and matching feline eye makeup smoking in a man’s suit in black stockings and dancewear backstage before a performance … In almost every picture, her kohl-rimmed eyes meet the viewer’s (and the photographer’s, more than likely a man) with confidence. Colette offers a lesson in how a woman can use style to take ownership of her image – ensuring that she always has the last word.Colette famously drew on her colourful life for her novels, including her experience of being a dancer in music halls (The Vagabond) and having an affair with a much younger man (Chéri and The Last of Chéri) the breakthrough Claudine series was inspired by her school days. The expressive “this is me” shrug of her attitude is just as refreshing today as it was more than a century ago. It cuts through the decades much like her way of wearing men’s tailoring – in soft velvet with lashings of eye makeup and jaunty neckscarves. Colette, the new biopic in cinemas this week with Keira Knightley in the title role, focuses on the author’s formative years. Growing up in the Burgundy countryside, she met Henry Gauthier-Villars AKA Willy, a controversial author and socialite who was an acquaintance of her father’s. He was 14 years her senior they married in 1893. As the film tells it, Colette used fashion as a way to express her transformation from a country girl in frills and long plaits to Parisian It-girl with a bob and a trouser suit (sidenote: Knightley’s leg of mutton blouses and cropped boleros could also work in 2019).Andrea Flesch, the film’s costume designer, says Colette’s style reflected not only her journey, but also the shifts in society at the turn of the century.The author herself was no slouch when it came to branding, either. Born Sidonie-Gabrielle, she became known by only her surname while she was still at school, recognising way before Madonna that a single moniker announces your importance from the get-go. After she separated from Willy, who famously plagiarised his wife, in 1906, this approach helped her as she became a giant of French literature.Those taking style inspiration from novelists such as Colette reflect a wider, more highbrow trend in fashion: US novelist Joan Didion featured in a Celine campaign in 2015 French New Wave director Agnès Varda is the cover star of The Gentlewoman autumn edition, while painter Georgia O’Keefe’s personal style was featured in the New Yorker last year.Terry Newman, in the coffee table book Legendary Authors and the Clothes They Wore, describes how Colette used clothes to “radiate character, both in her own life and in the lives of the characters she created in her writing”. That influence has endured in some surprising ways, from retail to Hollywood: she lent her name to Colette, the cult Parisian boutique that became an industry favourite before closing after 20 years in 2017. And Colette discovered Givenchy muse Audrey Hepburn, casting the almost-unknown actor in the stage version of her novel Gigi in 1951.Always in the avant garde, Colette was also a pioneer in her acceptance of androgyny and sexuality that was, then, taboo: the film shows the author’s relationship with aristocrat Mathilde de Morny, or Missy, who was gay and wore men’s clothes.Flesch says Missy changed Colette’s style – a moment dramatised in the biopic when Knightley wears a pair of cycling culottes to stroll around a Parisian park. “Wearing trousers was a statement from Missy,” says Flesch. “She was scandalous, and she was accepted because she was a noblewoman and rich. Colette wanted to show she was on the same level. She wanted to shock as well.”Style isn’t a footnote of Colette’s legacy, it’s a central part of it. Sixty-five years after her death, her influence extends beyond your bookshelf, Instagram captions and cinema: Colette’s free spirit is inspiring our wardrobes, too.Colette is released in the UK this week "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a3799341e5ff10a21a5abda943c2e4851e1187/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7878c7452aeaa4f35505b8e4da726559","title":"lfwm art school afterparty london fashion week men in pictures","story":"Tom Barratt and Eden Loweth’s first stand-alone Art School catwalk show opened London fashion week men’s at the weekend, celebrating the non-binary form with models cast to ‘push forward notions of otherness’.

Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, meanwhile, won best drama and best actor in a drama for Rami Malek.That film also performed strongly with British voters (though it was significantly omitted from the best film shortlist), taking it to level pegging – on seven nominations – with arch musical rival A Star is Born. Also on seven are First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling, which has so far met with little awards love, and with Alfonso Cuarón’s much-lauded Roma.Meanwhile Vice, the Dick Cheney biopic which bagged Christian Bale the best actor in a comedy or musical prize on Sunday, came away with six nominations. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman has five, and Green Book and Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War have four each.This year\u0027s Baftas take place on 10 February 2019. The ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall will be hosted by Joanna Lumley and broadcast – about 90 minutes after it actually happens – on BBC ONE.The Baftas are voted for by around 6,500 members of the British Film and Television Academy. These are industry workers who have to apply for membership – and pay an annual subscription of £450. Each category in the shortlists is decided by a chapter of around 100 specialists in that area. Once the shortlists are announced, all voters can have their say. If they haven\u0027t seen a particular film, they are supposed to abstain from voting in that category – but this is unenforced.\u0026nbspThe Baftas matter on their own terms, third only to the Golden Globes and the Oscars as prestige gongs. A Bafta win adds critical kudos – and, hopefully, box office – to a film, as well as credibility to an inidual\u0027s career. They also matter because of their proximity to the Oscars. Until 2001, the Baftas took place in April or May, but since the move to about a fortnight before the Academy Awards, their importance increased. This is because voting for the Oscars closes a few days after the Baftas, meaning it\u0027s the final chance for candidates to impress with their speeches - or for Oscar voters to seek to redress apparent miscarriages of justice. The Bafta and Oscar voting bases overlap considerably, too: around 500 people are thought to vote for both.\u0026nbspNot necessarily. A recent survey found the Baftas were only the fourth best Oscars bellwether – after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards. Since 2001, they\u0027ve predicted the best picture winner eight times out of a possible 17, erging the past four years running, opting for Three Billboards over The Shape of Water, La La Land over Moonlight, The Revenant\u0026nbspover Spotlight and\u0026nbspBoyhood\u0026nbspover Birdman. Their form is stronger when it comes to the acting categories, though they do consistently favour homegrown talent.\u0026nbspA big bronze mask on a marble base, which Bafta reserves the right to buy back for £1 should the recipient give it to anyone other than their children. Plus a certificate, with which the winner can do what they like.Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Mary Poppins Returns, Mary, Queen of Scots and Stan \u0026amp Ollie have three nominations each. Steve Coogan was nominated over co-star John C Reilly in the latter, perhaps betraying voters’ British bias, although Emily Blunt was passed over for her part as the magical nanny, with Mary Poppins Returns up only for technical awards.Significant snubs included Steve McQueen, whose followup to 12 Years a Slave, Widows, scored just one nomination, for leading actress Viola Davis. If Beale Street Could Talk’s Regina King was also omitted, despite being favourite for the best supporting actress Oscar.Mike Leigh’s Peterloo also failed to pick up a single nomination, while Black Panther took just one (for visual effects). Peterloo marks a rare failure for Film4, which picked up 20 nominations on Wednesday across a slate which includes The Favourite, Cold War and Widows. Meanwhile BBC Films came away with four for its titles, Stan \u0026amp Ollie and Apostasy.The Bafta shortlists were read out by actors Will Poulter and Hayley Squires. This is the first year the BFI’s ersity standards have become mandatory in the best debut and best British film categories.These require films to fulfil a number of different production-stage quotas that demonstrate that they have “worked to increase the representation of under-represented groups” in areas including “onscreen representation” and “industry access and opportunities”. They come as part of Bafta’s drive to up the ersity of its membership, as well as the breadth of films they choose to celebrate.This year’s best British film nominees are Bohemian Rhapsody, The Favourite, Stan \u0026amp Ollie, fashion documentary McQueen, Lynne Ramsay’s You Were Never Really Here, starring a vengeful Joaquin Phoenix, and serial killer thriller Beast. The latter is also up for best British debut for its writerdirector Michael Pearce. Pitted alongside him are Daniel Kokotajlo for Apostasy, set amongst suburban Jehovah’s Witnesses Chris Kelly for activist documentary A Cambodian Spring, and the teams behind Pili, about HIV sufferers in Tanzania, and neo kitchen sink drama Ray \u0026amp Liz.The nominees for the Rising Star award – which is voted for by the public – were revealed last week, with Black Panther’s Letitia Wright fancied as early frontrunner.The Baftas will be announced in a ceremony on 10 February hosted for the second time by Joanna Lumley.

With that in mind, here’s a last-ditch appeal to the Academy on behalf of 11 performers who’ve been flouted by the awards-season-industrial complex – some on account of admittedly stiff competition, others because they appear in smaller, less Oscar-baity films that staged less robust PR campaigns, and a few, sadly, because the movies in which they appear aren’t in English.Yes, the race for best actress is as stacked with terrific performances as it’s been in years, but the exclusion of Carey Mulligan from the conversation is as strange and egregious an oversight as they come. In Wildlife, the directorial debut from Paul Dano, Mulligan plays Jeanette, a 1960s housewife left to her own devices after her unemployed husband abandons her and her son to fight wildfires in the forests of Montana. In a narrative presented mostly from the perspective of Jeanette’s teenage son, Joe, Mulligan gives the best acting performance of the year, male or female: she’s fickle, fierce, combustible, and impish, her tone of voice often oscillating from cheerful to coarse in accordance with the character’s mood. In a story that’s more or less about a kid coming to recognize and reckon with his parent’s flaws, Mulligan plays Jeanette with a thrilling unpredictability that calls to mind Gena Rowland in A Woman Under the Influence – and forces us, as viewers, to recount the moment we realized our parents were human, too.In a film with a cast as numerous and decorated as Widows’ ensemble – Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Colin Farrell, Robert Duvall, Carrie Coon, Bryan Tyree Henry, Michelle Rodriguez, Cynthia Erivo, and Jacki Weaver are all here – it takes a real howitzer of a performance to stand out from the bunch. But in Steve McQueen’s follow-up to 12 Years a Slave, Daniel Kaluuya and Elizabeth Debicki do just that, occupying opposite ends of the film’s vast and frequently fluctuating moral continuum. As Jatemme Manning, the mob enforcer to his brother Jamal’s political campaign, Kaluuya oozes menace: to look into his eyes as he stares down a lackey spitting a few rap bars is to vow never to freestyle again. Debicki, meanwhile, is the film’s heart, a damaged woman in thrall to her abusive mother and husband who joins the Viola Davis-led heist and convinces you her life depends it. Both performances, though overlooked by most awards bodies (save a few critics’ groups), are emotionally rich but tactful, too, governed less by histrionics than meaningful glances and grimaces.The star of the year’s best film, Roma’s Yalitza Aparicio, still has an outside shot at nabbing a best actress nomination. But in a crowded year for supporting actress, headlined by Regina King, Amy Adams, and the women of The Favourite, Aparicio’s co-star Marina de Tavira has fallen through the cracks. That’s a shame, since what she does with her role as the matriarch of a household in turmoil is pretty breathtaking. Her character Sofia swings like a pendulum she lets out strident commands (“¿Adónde vas?,” she screams at her disobedient son) provides comic relief (watch her attempt to wriggle her Ford Galaxy between two trucks on a Mexico City freeway) and allows her character’s compassion and dejection to surface in gestures both big and small, a vast arsenal of actorly gifts at her disposal. “No matter what they tell you, as women, we are always alone,” she says to Cleo in a moment of desolation that’s brilliantly, perhaps surprisingly, punctuated by a burst of drunken physical comedy. In the humble opinion of this writer, it was the year’s second-best performance (a smidgen behind Mulligan).The year’s best, most cryptic villain – a personification of the “you v the guy she told you not to worry about” meme – was Steven Yeun’s Ben in Burning, the director Lee Chang-dong’s hypnotizing adaptation of Haruki Murakami’s short story. Think Jay Gatsby meets Patrick Bateman meets Dickie Greenleaf: Yeun plays this smooth-talking cosmopolite with a pathological charm that never quite reveals itself in full, which is precisely what makes the characterization so uniquely chilling and seductive. It’s a testament to Yeun’s commitment that Ben’s veneer of disquieting swagger never breaks: he yawns, laughs, speaks, smokes, shakes hands, and discloses his casual pyromania all with the same air of arrogant self-possession. Critics’ groups out of Chicago, Los Angeles, and Toronto recognized Yeun as the year’s best supporting actor, so perhaps it isn’t asking too much that the Academy take note too.This 20-year-old actor’s debut in Josephine Decker’s brilliant Madeline’s Madeline is on par with Natalie Portman in Black Swan and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche, New York, in the pantheon of art-and-life-blurring roles. A gifted actress in a New York City-based experimental theatre troupe, and a mercurial teenager on the verge of a psychotic break, Howard’s Madeline is that rare characterization of an adolescent that’s refreshingly unmoored from convention. Immersed in her subjectivity, we experience Madeline’s sense of disorientation in the world and then watch her bring pain and suffering into uncomfortably sharp focus, particularly in a dramatic monologue in which she’s asked to portray her own mother. In a year of outstanding film debuts from young female actors (Aparicio in Roma, Elsie Fisher in Eight Grade, Kiki Layne in If Beale Street Could Talk), Howard’s was particularly noteworthy.In the wake of the Golden Globes, Christian Bale may very well ride his win to a best actor Oscar, with Bradley Cooper and Viggo Mortensen trailing close behind. Each represents a different version of the kind of muscular, immersive leading performance the Academy likes to honor. What Lakeith Stanfield does in Boots Riley’s Sorry to Bother You, however, is considerably different. As Cassius “Cash” Green, an upwardly mobile telemarketer, Stanfield is often comically incredulous. Despite his ascent in the world of tech, things happen to Cash more often than he makes them happen, and Stanfield plays it with a certain affable bemusement. It’s one of those performances that works in service of a film-maker’s vision, in this case Riley’s wild satire of a late-capitalist wasteland and its machine full of cogs.Rare is a protagonist, especially a female, middle-aged protagonist, as multitudinous as Isabelle of Claire Denis’ radiant romcom Let the Sunshine In, the lifeblood of which is Juliette Binoche’s effusive, heartfelt, and guileless lead performance as a woman looking for love. Isabelle, and as far as we can tell, Binoche too, feels everything to the fullest extent, and throughout the film, a dialogue-heavy procession of encounters with different men, her face is a transient canvas of emotions experienced not one-by-one but all at once. Watch her, for instance, in the film’s final scene, a long discussion with a clairvoyant who predicts the future of Isabelle’s various dalliances. His every ination is met with its own reaction: Isabelle’s neck tenses up, or she laughs incredulously, or her smile broadens, or her lips purse. It’s a nakedly human and life-affirming performance from one of our greatest actors.The slow burn and eventual emotional gut punch of Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters is reflected most clearly in the supporting performance of Sakura Andô, who plays her character, Nobuyo, with a delicate touch not dissimilar to the film’s direction. She is sincere but necessarily stealthy, loving and devious, easily one of the most sympathetic and likable characters on film this year, which is odd if you come across a bare-boned synopsis of the movie: a family of savvy shoplifters kidnaps a young girl. In a scene where Nobuyo is interrogated by Japanese police, her eyes evince profound sadness and principled determination, like vectors for Kore-eda and the film’s touching exploration of a family linked by trust instead of blood.If it were up to me, Joaquin Phoenix would have two Oscars to his name and a third – for his performance as Joe in Lynne Ramsey’s You Were Never Really Here – on the way. Alas, Phoenix’s harsh, uncompromising turn as a hired gun who rescues sex-trafficked young girls has been mostly ignored by major awards bodies and critics’ groups, even though he took home the best actor prize at the Cannes film festival, where the film premiered in 2017. Here, Phoenix and his body appear more lived-in than ever, the lines that branch across his face suggesting toil and trauma. With more action than talk, Phoenix and Ramsey invite us into the character’s wounded headspace, effectively evoking the sense of rage and violent resolve that compels him to do what he does.As if the best actress conversation weren’t crowded enough, here’s another tour de force to consider. As a kindergarten teacher and failed poet in Sara Colangelo’s remake of the 2015 Israeli film of the same name, Maggie Gyllenhaal gives the year’s most anxiety-inducing performance, embodying obsessive compulsion and intellectual unease. Her character Lisa takes what seems like an innocent, maternal interest in the poetic ingenuity of one of her students, seeing it as her responsibility to cultivate his talent before it’s soiled, presumably like her own, by an increasingly vainglorious world. What ensues is a crescendo of discomfiting events that are both more and less ethically ambiguous than they feel, anchored by Gyllenhaal’s tremendous ability to be entirely consumed by her character’s one-track mind and strange sense of duty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3aea20b503114ec532fb4e8d5c811393128a5d/0_123_3685_2211/master/3685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd1a176a28a4eb739e45bc5468df33c","title":"benjamin pavard bayern munich join summer","story":"Bayern Munich have reached an agreement to sign the France defender Benjamin Pavard, who will join the German champions on a five-year deal from next season, according to the Bavarian club’s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic.The 22-year-old currently plays for their Bundesliga rivals VfB Stuttgart and was involved in France’s 2018 World Cup final victory over Croatia in Russia, a tournament where he also scored a stunning goal in the last-16 win over Argentina.

The 45-year-old takes over from Gary Rowett, who was sacked on Tuesday after less than eight months in charge.The decision to turn to Jones represents a significant shift in Stoke’s approach to managerial appointments, given the value that they have previously placed on experience. That strategy has not worked, however, and has resulted in Mark Hughes, Paul Lambert and Rowett leaving their positions in the space of little more than a year.Jones is not a high-profile name but he has a burgeoning reputation in the game after impressively turning around Luton’s fortunes following his appointment in January 2016. The Welshman led Luton to promotion from League Two last season, after missing out in the play-offs the year before, and they are currently second in League One.He will inherit a Stoke team that are languishing in 14th place in the Championship, which is well below the expectations of the club’s board, who had targeted an immediate return to the Premier League after suffering relegation last season. With Stoke only eight points outside the play-offs, that objective could still be achieved if Jones can make an immediate impact, starting with Saturday’s trip to Brentford.Stoke said in a statement: “We have been following Nathan’s career for sometime and when we met him were hugely impressed with his clear vision as to how he will achieve success at Stoke.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/437270827b1c182ac795cd75af60e6fa531b0df9/0_579_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95ca2aece3e1ae02ff337b509f04a14f","title":"tottenham new stadium mid march earliest delay football","story":"Tottenham fear that they will not be able to move into their new stadium until mid-March at the earliest, after announcing further delays to the late-running £1bn project.The club have used Wembley as a temporary home since the start of last season and they have now confirmed they will play another sequence of fixtures there – namely the Premier League games against Watford (30 January), Newcastle (2 February) and Leicester (10 February), together with the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund (13 February).If Spurs were to win at Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fourth round at the end of this month, there is the possibility they could get a home tie in the next round on the weekend of 16-17 February. That would also be staged at Wembley.The club’s subsequent home game would be the derby against Arsenal on 2 March and there is no chance of them being allowed to open the stadium that day. They want the grand opening to go smoothly and the politan police and security personnel have made it clear that what is the most troublesome fixture of the season would be too great a risk.All of which leaves the home league game against Palace on 16 March as the best-case scenario, although that would clash with a possible FA Cup quarter-final.It feels like a long time ago that the hoped-for move in game was Liverpool on 15 September. The club said in early September that they would stay at Wembley until the end of October and they would subsequently extend that arrangement until the end of 2018.In mid-December, they said that the Manchester United game this Sunday would be also played at Wembley. The major issues have been to do with the stadium’s critical safety systems but there have been numerous other problems. Levy has had to pay increased rents at Wembley this season and they have contributed to the spiraling costs of the project.In PR terms, it has been a disaster while there have been mutterings of disquiet from some of the other clubs in the Premier League. Manchester City were unhappy to be messed about over the timing and venue of their away fixture with Spurs, which was eventually designated for Wembley on Monday 29 October, with an evening kick-off, because the national stadium was taken up the day before by an NFL game.City paid for coach travel to London for their away supporters and they asked Spurs whether they would like to contribute. Spurs said no.More recently, the Cardiff manager, Neil Warnock, argued that Tottenham ought to remain at Wembley for the remainder of the season, as to move now would offer a competitive advantage to the relegation-threatened clubs that still had to play them away.Warnock’s theory was that when Spurs did move, it would take them time to settle and visiting teams would benefit. The Spurs manager, Mauricio Pochettino, countered that by saying his team would be boosted immediately when they moved but, in which case, the relegation-threatened teams that still had to visit them would surely be disadvantaged. That said, Spurs have beaten every team they have already played from the bottom half of the table at Wembley."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/011280ba787c724c52a9e66be735b119931275d6/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a182d9c792a3542c4e20666473317ad2","title":"ten football league teenagers watch 2019","story":"After several game-changing cameos off the bench, the York-born forward was finally handed his full debut by Marcelo Bielsa last Sunday.

Clarke has pleasantly surprised Bielsa, becoming the Argentinian’s go-to man, asked to spark Leeds into life at half-time on no fewer than six occasions since November. “When I started to look at his skills I didn’t imagine that he could make the difference as he is,” Bielsa said.After unsuccessful spells at Tottenham and QPR, the former Luton schoolboy arrived at Norwich on the same basis as a 16-year-old. Earmarked by academy staff as a future first-team right-back even before earning a contract, he was championed by the then youth coach Matt Gill after shining on tour in Latvia. Aarons, a cousin of the Newcastle winger Rolando, has not looked back since, establishing himself as a fixture in Daniel Farke’s high-flying side and winning four caps for England Under-19s since breaking into the team at the start of the season.It speaks volumes that Manchester United are among the clubs watching Semenyo, who joined Newport on a season’s loan in the summer. His performance helped the Exiles dump Leicester out of the FA Cup and led to Danny Simpson being hooked on the hour. Originally from south London, the powerful forward joined Bristol City almost 18 months ago after being spotted playing for South Gloucestershire and Stroud College, where the Championship club’s academy is based. Semenyo impressed on loan at Bath City last season and made his Bristol City debut in May. Saikou Janneh, the 18-year-old scoring for fun on loan at Torquay under Gary Johnson, the father of City’s manager, Lee, is another exciting forward.The youngster is the latest academy graduate to excel in the first team, following in the footsteps of James Maddison and Callum Wilson. Bayliss will likely make his 50th league appearance on Saturday and the ball-playing central midfielder has been at the heart of the Sky Blues’ rise since his full debut a little over a year ago. Tall and slight, Bayliss signed as an under-11 following an open trial but has had to overcome a couple of setbacks, including a hairline back fracture in his mid-teens, and the very late developer was made to wait before being offered a scholarship. “James always lit up training and the games, but Tom’s journey was a lot more steady than that – in a good way,” said academy manager Richard Stevens.“Remember the name,” said the Forest academy manager, Gary Brazil, last summer. There is a reason why Forest are keen to tie the winger, who has just turned 18 and made his league debut on New Year’s Day, to a new long-term contract. Appiah, another graduate from the revered academy, spent pre-season with the first team and has been tracked by top-flight clubs since shining for the under-23s as a 15-year-old. Born in the Netherlands to Ghanaian parents, Appiah has played for England through the age groups and was part of the under-17s squad that reached the semi-finals of the European Championships in May. A full-back’s worst nightmare, Appiah ghosts past players. “I think 2019 will be a good year for him,” Aitor Karanka said.The right-back has seized the chance afforded to him by Frank Lampard with both hands. Bogle caught the Derby manager’s eye in pre-season, was promoted to the first team and has kept Andre Wisdom out of the side ever since. Bogle progressed through the under-18s and under-23s last season before making his mark in the Championship and signed a new contract in September. The Reading-born defender joined Derby from Swindon in January 2016, the same month another prospect who has impressed Lampard, the winger Luke Thomas – previously coveted by Southampton and West Ham – arrived from Cheltenham. With Louie Sibley and Max Bird, too, Derby are not short of talent.The left-winger grew up in Leeds, played for Newcastle and scored his first league goal against Sunderland. But he is finding his feet at Boro, the club he joined at 13 and for whom he made his first-team debut four days after hitting a hat-trick for the under-23s. He started last year on loan at MK Dons but since returning to the Riverside the England Under-20s international has showcased further glimpses of his ability, predominantly off the bench for his club. Tavernier was briefly promoted to train with Gareth Southgate’s England squad in September, as cover for Raheem Sterling.Chris Powell has been careful not to amplify the noise around the energetic midfielder, though it has been impossible for his manager not to acknowledge the talents of a player who joined Southend aged 11. That Yearwood was named by Powell as captain for a game in November is a mark of his maturity, with his performances attracting attention from clubs including Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough. Yearwood earned an England Under-18s call-up in May but was forced to pull out with a hamstring injury. “This is the best place for Dru at the current time,” Powell said.There are stories of a 16-year-old Adshead doing his homework on the team bus to Millwall and having to get changed away from his Rochdale teammates owing to child protection regulations but, 12 months on from his full debut, his challenge is to cement a regular starting berth. Athletic and intelligent – he attended the same college in Gorton as Nicky Butt – Adshead was fast-tracked into the first team at Rochdale, with whom he first trained at 14. He signed a professional contract in September and as his manager, Keith Hill, said: “You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know Dan’s got a great future.”Harper was a striker but academy staff at West Brom spotted glimpses of Patrick Vieira’s powerful style and moulded him into a box-to-box midfielder three seasons ago. Not even born when the former Arsenal midfielder lifted the World Cup with France in 1998, he made his debut 18 months ago. Harper has worked with Darren Moore, now head coach at Albion, since the under-12s so seemingly has the perfect manager to help him into the first team on a more regular basis. He impressed after being handed a starting berth in the FA Cup last weekend. “He’s got wonderful balance, his first touch and control is excellent, he moves the ball away from danger and he’s got the ability to put his foot on the gas,” Moore said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d42d1a6bf9283d07048f5e0acc098d2c01e093d4/780_828_4692_2815/master/4692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcdee60c3fd73844018e0b532b3fba5","title":"shop see and scran a liverpool 24 hour guide","story":"The incomparable north-west city is renowned for its vibrant sights and nightlife. The main question is how to fit it all in? Our Scouse insider brings you the lowdownI might be biased but I’ve long held the belief that Liverpool is The Best City In The World™. Being a port city historically, it has all the multiculturalism (and variety and spice) of London, but the closeness, community and solidarity of a smaller community – one that faces challenges and adversity together. In other words, don’t mess with Liverpool we’re feisty.For a relatively small city, Liverpool has a lot going on. If you’re planning a visit – and you should, there are affordable trains running from London, Birmingham and elsewhere with London Northwestern Railway – it’s hard to know where to start. Here are my recommendations for 24 hours in Liverpool, from the old favourites you’ve definitely heard of to a couple of things that only a local would know.Eating out, or ‘going for a scran’ in ScouseApparently, breakfast is the most important meal of the day – and there’s nowhere better to kick off your trip to Liverpool than Brasco Lounge. It’s the perfect place to start the day and start falling in love with Liverpool.During the 1980s the Albert Dock was nothing more than derelict ruins, but thanks to some heavy investment it’s now the most picturesque spot in town filled with pretty shops, exclusive bars and some of the most expensive apartments in the city. Brasco Lounge faces this and has its back to the Pier Head (home to the iconic Liver Building). Inside Brasco you’ll find an eclectic mix of antiques, vintage art and reclaimed wooden tables all bathed in natural light. And what does natural light translate to? Unreal food pictures for “the gram”, that’s what. May I recommend the eggs benedict or florentine, which are the best of either I’ve ever had.If you’re arriving for lunch, grab a bite and quick pic at Love Thy Neighbour on Bold Street, which gets my prize for most creative use of pink paint in the city. Sitting at the end of a row of shops, it boasts a huge blank wall to the side – so they painted it pink and adorned it with illustrations and mantras, the most famous of which being “Avocado is bae”. It’s loved by locals, visitors and bloggers alike for its healthy food, designed to make you feel beautiful inside and out, and its unusual cocktails – beetroot bloody mary anyone? It’s a great place for a spot of lunch, people-watching and getting those all-important holiday snaps.For something a little more eco, there’s Down the Hatch, a vegetarian and vegan restaurant with a difference: it’s not berry bowls and kale sandwiches you’ll find here, it’s kebabs and hotdogs and pulled pork – all with the absence of meat. Many a meat-eater has dined here and sworn blind they couldn’t tell the difference.SightseeingEven if you’re of the opinion that bus tours are a bit on the touristy side, you can’t deny that they’re an effective way of cramming lots of sights and interesting facts into a limited amount of time: it’s efficient travelling. Liverpool has one very special, very Liverpool and very unique bus tour, though, and that’s the Magical Mystery Tour. The Beatles phenomenon remains a huge draw to the city and we’re all very proud of the four local lads who shook the world. Roll up, roll up for the Mystery Tour, even though it’s not much of a mystery that it’ll take you around all of the famous Beatles landmarks such as Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane. You’ll also get to see some other fantastic Liverpool sights along the way all in a warm, covered, Technicolor tour bus.Around 15 minutes north of the city centre, past the (still very active) docklands you’ll find Crosby beach, which is always full of people, no matter what time of the day or night – iron people to be exact. Anthony Gormley’s Another Place art installation features 100 iron men, all staring out to sea. It was supposed to be a temporary exhibit and move on to New York, but the people of Liverpool took these figures to their hearts and we’ve kept them. The locals make sure the beach is kept clean and tidy it’s our pride and joy. Visit here at sunset for an absolutely breathtaking view.For an architecture hit, stroll through the Georgian Quarter. There’s something about Georgian houses, particularly the windows that do things to me, and here you’ll find gorgeous windows, cobbled streets, ornate front steps and pretty blossom trees. It is without doubt the city’s most photogenic and aesthetically pleasing postcode and it’s perfect for an afternoon stroll. One of the houses on Falkner Street was recently featured on the BBC’s A House Through Time and anyone who’s into period properties and history will be in their element.Liverpool is a city that keeps on surprising you. I’ve only recently discovered the St James Gardens myself. Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral is the largest in the UK and the fifth largest in the world – you can climb the bell tower and take in the famous Liverpool skyline but what I would like to point out is actually ground level. By the main entrance you’ll find a winding path down into the cathedral gardens. Walking through a graveyard might not be for everyone, but there’s a strange sense of peace here. It’s as if the city around you stops existing. This is a wonderful place to catch your breath on your whirlwind tour of Liverpool. Added bonus: you’ll find a natural spring said to have healing properties here.ShoppingLiverpool One is the city’s beating heart of retail. Here you’ll find all your high street stores, restaurant chains and a bustling street scene. You can easily make a day of such retail therapy, grab a cocktail and unwind between stores (one of the real perks of taking the train). You certainly won’t be short of places to exercise that plastic – just don’t be alarmed if you see us Liverpool girls walking round in rollers, it’s just how we get ready for a night out, and here, hair is king. But if you’re after something a bit different, then at the edge of the Baltic Triangle you’ll find the old red-brick Cains Brewery building. It’s now a maze of vintage and antique shops and a recently opened indoor market, which is filled with local independent businesses. It’s quirky heaven – you’ll definitely find some unique souvenirs to take away with you, and maybe even some furniture.Located right next to the world famous Cavern Club is Cavern Walks, a tiny but exclusive shopping mall. This is where our Vivienne Westwood store is and of course, the footballers wives’ favourite, Cricket. You only have to Google Coleen Rooney or Alex Gerrard and one of the first pictures will no doubt be a photo of them swinging a Cricket store bag. If Balenciaga and Givenchy are your poison, then this is worth a swing by.Drinks and nightlifeI wouldn’t say Liverpool was image obsessed, but we appreciate a good aesthetic and we’re not afraid to go the extra mile to make things memorable, especially when it comes to our nightlife. Perhaps that’s why we’re host to The Florist, considered by some to be one of the most Instagramable bars in the UK. You won’t find a prettier place to sip a cocktail. There isn’t a square inch of this place that isn’t covered in some sort of floral arrangement, whether it be neon signs, spray paint or thousands of artificial flowers. Expect your cocktails to be garnished with real flowers (obviously) and make sure to try the hibiscus cooler, you’ll regret it if you don’t.Alma de Cuba, meanwhile, might look like a plain, box-shaped former church on the outside, but on the inside it’s one of the most ornately decorated bars you’ve ever seen and is a Liverpool nightlife institution. Early in the evening it’s a sophisticated cocktail bar and restaurant but as it gets late on a Friday and Saturday night you’ll find yourself caught up in a storm of confetti known as the petal drop then the atmosphere completely changes. The soul of Cuba arrives and you’ll find yourself up on stage burning calories faster than you can consume them with the sexy samba dancers and infectious Latin music.But there’s nothing more alluring than a secret bar and Liverpool has a few – the undisputed pick of the bunch being 81Ltd. Hidden at the top of a darkened staircase, behind a secret door in Salt Dog Slims bar and only accessible by a secret code that changes weekly, you’ll (maybe) find the tiny speakeasy bar, 81Ltd. With a maximum capacity of 60 people, it fills up fast. If you do manage to find it and you do manage to get in, try the Siberian truth serum cocktail.If you sample just one slice of Liverpool’s nightlife while you’re in the city, make it Bongo’s Bingo. These nights always sell out, so this is something you’d have to buy a ticket for in advance, but it is well worth the extra planning. Hosted by Johnny Bongo, this irreverent bingo night is all about the laughs generated by both the host himself and the ridiculous prizes up for grabs – you could be walking away with anything from a box of Coco Pops to a life-size cut out of Philip Schofield. Jeremy Corbyn himself was a recent guest host at Bongo’s Bingo and one lucky lady got to go home with a life-size, autographed cut out of the man himself. Expect plenty of dancing on the tables and glow sticks as well.Liverpool is a 24-hour city, so there’s plenty to keep you entertained until the first train home.

The direct marketing literature stated that it would not be Christmas without “the look on her face”.Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said the leaflet had been clearly designed to pull at the heart strings of the vulnerable, and was a “new low” for the payday lending industry.Reeves, who is the MP for Leeds West, said the company was clearly trying to exploit the financially vulnerable.On Monday she wrote to the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, asking what action the regulator could take against Provident, in a bid to prevent such adverts appearing again.“I believe this was a cynical tactic to exploit vulnerable people who struggle financially at the best of times, let alone over the festive season. Provident tried to use a deliberately, emotionally loaded message to urge them to take out a loan at a rip-off rate of interest,” Reeves said.Last week the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the advert had been irresponsible, and it had targeted vulnerable consumers. The ASA ruled that it should not be used again.Reeves said she believed the ASA’s action had not gone far enough in tackling Provident’s behaviour, which is why she was writing to the FCA.In response, Provident said: “The ASA informed us of a complaint made about the advertisement and we subsequently removed it from circulation, prior to the ASA’s final ruling. Provident also provided assurances to the ASA that such content will not be used in any further marketing materials.”Provident previously told the ASA that credit was only issued “following a face-to-face meeting in a customer’s home, where their needs were discussed and where checks on affordability, suitability and sustainability were made”.In 2017, Provident Financial, as it was then called, lost two-thirds of its stock market value in a day, after the doorstep lender parted company with its chief executive and revealed it was facing an FCA investigation into its credit card business.In the same year it replaced 4,500 self-employed sales agents who went door to door, offering loans and collecting debts, with 2,500 full-time “customer experience managers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a57f0151e054de95ddc36646215d2535108dbd01/0_82_1883_1129/master/1883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf2e91e5a86b1ad20e19cd6503fcfa28","title":"kate bush clarifies political stance i am not a tory supporter","story":"Singer expressed support for Theresa May in 2016 but says she was simply celebrating a woman in powerKate Bush has written a statement clarifying her political beliefs, saying a magazine interview from 2016 “could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not”.In the interview with the Canadian magazine Maclean’s, Bush was reported as voicing support for the British prime minister, Theresa May.Answering a question about Hillary Clinton and “the fear of women’s power”, she said: “We have a female prime minister here in the UK. I actually really like her and think she’s wonderful. I think it’s the best thing that’s happened to us in a long time. She’s a very intelligent woman but I don’t see much to fear. “I will say it is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She’s very sensible and I think that’s a good thing at this point in time.”Writing on her website, Bush says the quote was “out of context … it seemed as if the focus went on to the quote rather than the work. It was deeply frustrating.”She says she decided not to clarify her words at the time but was now moved to comment after the quote had been aired again in articles about her recently remastered back catalogue and a book of her collected lyrics. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power. I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time – because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.The latter reference is to David Cameron, who has been criticised for calling the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, which led to Brexit.Bush is still a relatively reclusive figure, and did no interviews around the recent reissues and lyric collection. In 2014, she performed her first live shows in 35 years, having not toured since her only ever run of live dates in 1979.She does write occasional messages on her website though, recently including tributes to the late recording engineer Geoff Emerick and the choreographer Lindsay Kemp.

It estimates there are 1,250 EU citizens and others who would need to apply to secure settled status to remain in the UK, at a cost of £80,000.The government has demanded that the 3 million EU nationals legally resident in the UK complete paperwork to prove their right to remain and access public services permanently after Brexit – and insisted that applicants pay £65 to complete the paperwork.Alison McGovern, a Labour backbencher, said the government should reverse its policy and pay the fee for its employees, adding: “The fact that the government has no idea how many European citizens it employs tells you all you need to know about the shambolic Brexit preparations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94519edf537f4753e8c99c4b174fea9e1261f971/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=108823171bab8ea62a7edd1c4d4fee6e","title":"mps to get final say on brexit backstop theresa may confirms","story":"PM tries to shore up support for her Brexit deal with pledge that MPs will get vote on backstop Theresa May has confirmed that MPs would get a final say on whether a backstop solution for the Irish border would ever be put in place, as she attempted to shore up support for her Brexit plan in the first prime minister’s questions of the year.Speaking before the resumption of the Commons debate on her proposals, which will culminate next Tuesday in a vote postponed from December, May insisted she could reassure MPs about the backstop.But Jeremy Corbyn, who used all his questions to focus on Brexit, urged May to rule out the possibility of a no-deal departure and said that if she lost next week’s vote she should “let the people have a real say” by calling a general election.The Labour leader began by saying May had failed to get any further assurances from EU leaders on the backstop, the insurance policy that would prevent a hard Irish border in the event of no permanent trade deal by keeping Northern Ireland under some EU regulations for an interim period.“Isn’t the PM bringing back exactly the same deal she admitted would be defeated four weeks ago?” he asked.May responded by saying she had gained new EU assurances with legal status, adding: “These discussions have shown that further clarification on the backstop is possible, and those talks will continue over the next few days.”She highlighted the government’s new package of methods for Northern Ireland to have a say on the backstop, if it came into effect. The prime minister continued: “We’ve also been looking at how parliament can take a greater role as we take negotiations on to the next stage.“And so I can tell the house that in the event that our future relationship or alternative arrangements are not ready by the end of 2020, parliament will have a vote on whether to seek to extend the implementation period, or bring the backstop into effect.”This arrangement had been hinted at before Christmas, but May’s pledge is intended to further assure concerned Tory MPs.However, Corbyn said May was offering only “window dressing”, and predicted the deal would be voted down. The prime minister, he said, was “recklessly wasting time, holding the country to ransom with the threat of no deal, in a desperate attempt to blackmail MPs to vote for her hopelessly unpopular deal”.Twice Corbyn asked May if she would discount the idea of no deal, especially after MPs backed an amendment to the finance bill from Labour’s Yvette Cooper to curb some of the government’s tax administration powers in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU.“Will the prime minister listen to the will of house last night, end this costly charade, and rule out no deal?” the Labour leader asked.May responded by saying Corbyn was himself ruling out the only deal acceptable to Brussels. “The only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal,” she said.Corbyn lambasted May over her position. He said: “Instead of backing industries in this country in protecting thousands of jobs in manufacturing and service industries, her transport secretary is awarding millions of pounds of contracts to ferry companies with no ferries, to run on routes that don’t exist, and apparently they won’t even be ready by the end of April either.“This is the degree of incompetence of this government in dealing with the whole question of relations with the EU.”He continued: “The prime minister has spent the last week begging for warm words from EU leaders, and achieved nothing. Not one single dot or comma has changed.”“So if her deal is defeated next week, as I hope and expect it will, will the prime minister do the right thing and let the people have a real say and call a general election?”May rejected the idea, and instead mocked Corbyn for what she said were his changing views on many elements of Brexit, such as free movement, the customs union and when to begin the departure process.She said: “The one thing we know about the right honourable gentleman is that his Brexit policies are the many, not the few.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42d53d39ddaf99aa974ccd932dae4e8b34e2825/323_134_1653_992/master/1653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a86010d15789928de2efd338fdf4306","title":"brexit latest news debate pmqs may corbyn grieve mps launch bid to ensure they vote on plan b within three days if mays deal defeated politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs and the first day of the Brexit debateJacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, asks Bercow if he can confirm that the motion, as amended, would have to be put by a member of the government.And he asks for a ruling on the meaning of the word “forthwith”. Erskine May (the Commons procedural Bible) says motions of the kind being debated today must be put to a vote “forthwith”. But Erskine May specifies “forthwith” in other circumstances. So does Bercow’s ruling affect those circumstances too.Bercow says he will reflect on the second point. On the first point, if a motion has been moved, it must be put to a vote.Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, says the House of Commons is now taking back control. That is to be welcomed, he says.He says it is time to move on to the vote.Bercow says he would like to move on, but he will treat colleagues with courtesy, and take a few more points of order.Simon Hoare, a Conservative, says Bercow risks undermining the dignity of his post. He says we are in “choppy waters”.Bercow says he is “deeply grateful”. (He is not concealing his sarcasm very successfully.) He says he will reflect on what Hoare said.Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Brexiter, says over the last 25 years or so he has repeatedly been told business motions cannot be amended. Allowing them to be amended has huge implications. It will affect how the government gets its business through the Commons. Will Bercow tell the clerks that in future backbenchers will be able to amend business motions?Bercow says he will reflect on this. But he does not think it is unreasonable for backbenchers to seek to amend business motions.He says he does understand the importance of precedent.But precedent does not completely bind.If we were guided completely by precedent, then manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change.As Duncan Smith said, this potentially has huge consequences. By and large, the government controls the business in the Commons it decides what gets debated and when, etc. If the Commons as a whole gets to take these decisions, particularly in a parliament where the government does not have a majority, then the executive will have been significantly weakened.Leadsom rises again. Did the clerk say Bercow’s plan was acceptable? Or did he advise against it?Bercow says the clerk offered him advice. They discussed it. When Bercow took his decision, the clerk offered further advice.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, asks Bercow whether the clerk of the Commons supported his decision. Will he publish the advice he received from the clerk?There is loud cheering from Tory MPs for this.Bercow says the advice he gets from the clerks is given to him in private.But he says he also had a written note from the clerk, which he quoted from in his response to the first point of order.Heidi Allen, a Conservative pro-European, says she is “hopping mad”. We are 79 days from Brexit, she says. She says MPs should be getting on with debating a plan B for Brexit.The Labour MP Stephen Doughty says the government does not want the Commons to have a say on Brexit. He says members of the public watching cannot see Julian Smith, the chief whip, texting journalists. He criticises the government for tabling the business of the house motion very late yesterday.Bercow says MPs can decide for themselves whether it was helpful for the motion to be tabled when it was.Labour’s Alison McGovern asks Bercow whether he agrees that, if MPs disagree with the amendment, they can just vote against it.Bercow says he agrees.Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, says he is surprised MPs are against MPs being given a vote. He suggests some of his Brexiter colleagues should join the yellow jacket brigade outside the Commons.Mark Francois, a Tory Brexiter, says he has a copy of the original business motion. It said no motion to vary or supplement the provisions of the motion could be made except by a minister of the crown (ie, it said only a minister could amend the business motion for the Brexit debate). He says this is a motion passed by the house. He says in his 18 years as an MP he has never seen a Speaker override a motion of the house. He has heard Bercow say many times before that he cannot override a motion of the house. So why is he doing that today?Bercow says the business motion said no motion could be moved other than by a minister of the crown. But we are not talking about a motion, he says we are talking about an amendment.Eddie Hughes, a Conservative, goes next with a point of order. He asks Bercow to cite the precedent for amendments being allowed to a business motion like the one on the order paper today (which MPs had assumed to be unamendable).Bercow says he is not obliged to cite precedent.But he is clear in his mind that the motion can be amended.The business motion allows no debate. But it does not say no amendment is allowed, he says.MPs are now dealing with points of order.Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says he was told by the clerks yesterday that he could not table an amendment to the business motion. But an amendment tabled by Dominic Grieve has been allowed.John Bercow, the Speaker, says he does not know why Bone was told the motion could not be amended.All I know is that in my understanding the motion is amendable. I’m clear in my mind about that.Bercow says, if he had known Bone wanted to table an amendment, he would have supported that.Julian Lewis, a Conservative, says May has told MPs on 74 occasions that the UK will leave the EU on 29 March. Can she categorically rule out delaying that?May says she is happy to say what she has said before, which is that the UK will leave on that date.Paul Scully, a Conservative, says more Londoners voted for Brexit than voted for Sadiq Khan as mayor.May says Khan should back the Brexit deal.Labour’s Rachael Maskell asks what May will do differently to ensure no homeless person dies in 2019.May lists some of the measures taken by the government, and says it will put more money into mental health services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2e077035ef08b96c37c38cd5f86dadb938a2d8c/0_39_4867_2920/master/4867.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2543ab135124e7aebc742c3078d648f5","title":"ashley giles new england cricket director ecb","story":"• England cricket director praises predecessor Andrew Strauss• Priority to find replacement for head coach Trevor BaylissAshley Giles, England’s new director of cricket, is keen to make sure nothing derails the team’s potential success this year.Giles has taken over from Andrew Strauss in the top role at the England and Wales Cricket Board. He comes into the job months before England host a World Cup they are favourites to win, which is followed by an Ashes series.He said: “Straussy’s done a great job and handed over a ship which is in pretty good shape, heading into what is an exciting year. I have to support the coaches and players and make sure there’s nothing down the line that will interfere with the direction we’re going in.“There’s still no guarantee that we will win the World Cup or the Ashes but my role is to give us the best possible chance leading into those two tournaments to give us the most success.”One of Giles’s main priorities will be to find a replacement for Trevor Bayliss, the head coach, who will leave his role at the end of the summer. Giles, who was sacked as England’s one-day coach four years ago, is open to appointing separate successors to Bayliss for the Test and limited-overs sides.“Clearly the new coaching structure is going to be front and centre and there’s a lot to think about,” he added. “There’s been a lot made of two coaches – one specialist under one coach. There are a lot of different options and I need some time to look at everything.“Myself and Andy Flower split the role. I think it can work, absolutely.

After dominating a low-key hit-out in Melbourne, Tomic ensured post-match talk would not centre on the result but rather the comical manner of his victory after he played a sneaky underarm between-the-legs serve on match point.Tomic, who was once world No 17 but plummeted down the rankings during a period of decline that culminated in a brief appearance on a reality TV show last year, faced Kyrgios – no stranger to controversy himself – in a much-hyped pre-Australian Open exhibition match at the Kooyong Classic. Now ranked 85, Tomic proved sharper than the 51-ranked Kyrgios and put himself in a winning position with little fuss.Needing just one more point for victory, as he settled into his service stance, Tomic dropped a ball and hit it between his legs while continuing to bounce another ball, apparently in preparation to serve in the normal fashion. The unorthodox serve bounced in on the other side of the net, catching Kyrgios – as well as the umpire and the crowd at Kooyong – completely off guard.After a moment of deliberation, the umpire announced game, set and match to Tomic, leaving Kyrgios to laugh in bewilderment and shake his head as he moved off the court. “I don’t think there has ever been a player like BT,” Kyrgios said afterwards. “It is great to see him back out here as I know he was going through some rough times. He won a title last year and it looks like he is carrying a bit of momentum which is good to see.”The legality of the shot was not questioned by the umpire at the time, however according to the ITF’s rules of the game, underarm serving only allowed if the ball is struck before it hits the ground. Tomic’s effort appeared to bounce off the court before his racket struck it.The Queenslander failed to qualify for last year’s Australian Open but has won a place at next week’s tournament at Melbourne Park thanks to his improved ranking. “He looks happy, he looks healthy. That’s the main thing,” Kyrgios added. “You never want to see a talent like that go down and keep being down.”The hit-out lacked intensity but Tomic’s performance, particularly in the first set, was impressive, albeit coming against an opponent who appeared not yet to be up to tournament speed. Tomic broke Kyrgios in the fourth game of the match before going on to claim the first set and when he broke at 3-3 in the second, there was no looking back.Not all onlookers were impressed with what they saw on Wednesday, however. Australian Olympian Georgie Parker labelled the efforts of the players “an absolute joke”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9859d400f41723dba49da8690a02b3506a1eb09/0_199_5384_3229/master/5384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afe786d78ee23acab41a6be8b6c551e0","title":"school bus leeds cultural community college slung low","story":"Arts education is in crisis but theatre company Slung Low has set up a pay-what-you-can community college, offering lessons in art activism, wood-whittling and much moreOn board a double-decker in Holbeck, a small revolution in cultural education is brewing. In this corner of Leeds, locals are learning for the love of it on a bus that has been converted into classrooms. Inspired by the education programmes that used to be run by the Women’s Institute and working men’s clubs, the Cultural Community College offers classes free at the point of use, without any obvious instrumental purpose – a gesture that is, in the current climate, quietly radical.The college is the brainchild of theatre company Slung Low and was born out of the company’s own experience of learning new skills while making Flood, a large-scale series of works for Hull city of culture 2017. “What we found is that when we learned stuff - no matter what it was - we were generally more confident about everything,” says artistic director Alan Lane. And so the company wondered if they could pass that confidence on to others.“We had this idea that we could open a college that would not be in any way useful for anyone’s occupation,” Lane explains. “That it would operate beyond the market, that it would be ‘pay what you decide’, and that we would teach as broad a cultural offer – from stargazing to blacksmithing and everything in between – as we could possibly finance.”And that’s just what the company has done. In its first term, the Cultural Community College has taught Holbeck residents how to make everything from vegetarian Indian food to furniture to documentary films. There have been courses on art as activism and CPR, as well as the stargazing and blacksmithing.People might wonder what a theatre company is doing setting up a college. For Lane, the answer is simple: “It’s the most useful thing we could do.” He adds: “We’ve never had a programme which has been so well received by the theatre industry. The college has really struck a chord.” The first courses were fully booked online within 48 hours, and Slung Low has been inundated with offers from artists who want to share their expertise.Over time, the idea is that the college’s members take ownership of the curriculum, with courses selected through a dialogue between Slung Low and the community. “It’s not pure cultural democracy,” says Lane, “but it’s definitely true that there are subjects and classes that people will be able to point to and say, ‘I told them to do that.’”It’s no coincidence that the Cultural Community College has appeared at a time when arts education is perceived to be in crisis. The exclusion of arts subjects from the English baccalaureate has led to a decline in their study at many schools, while the emphasis on so-called “facilitating subjects” has discouraged students from choosing arts A-level options. In his new book The British Betrayal of Childhood, former children’s commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green even includes the downgrading of arts education as one of the factors driving a “crisis in childhood”.Lane and his team were certainly conscious of the challenges currently facing arts education, but the Cultural Community College has an offer that’s distinct from the instruction provided by schools, universities and the education departments of theatres. Slung Low want to bring in people who may be put off by traditional learning environments, and so they’ve been thinking carefully about how and where their courses take place – hence the bus, aboard which some of the lessons are taught, as well as at the Holbeck (formerly Holbeck Working Men’s Club), Slung Low’s new HQ.Lane is reluctant to describe the course instructors as teachers instead he calls them talkers, or experts. “There is a failure of imagination going on at every possible level of society,” Lane suggests, “and that’s starting with children in schools, where we have decided that to learn to remember things is more important than to imagine things.” He adds that “the college is a kind of response to that failure of imagination, but it’s also very aware of not trying to replicate an arts education”.Unlike many of those fighting for arts education – including the signatories of a letter to the  last year expressing “grave concern” about the exclusion of the arts in schools – Lane does not fall back on the economic argument. For him, and for Slung Low, cultural learning is about confidence, citizenship and empathy. The real question is not what arts education can do for the nation’s finances, but what it can do for people and communities. “Does it make better citizens, and does that have any impact on all our lives?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/780cb7646e6f48e2a956e8a862f2d06f959f0b15/395_169_4542_2725/master/4542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd877f1c91babad67b6d9e537548ff93","title":"commonism review birmingham rep","story":"Birmingham RepAndy Smith and Amund Sjølie Sveen imagine a future of radical equality and freedom in a performance that comes with its own manifestoBilled as a “performed conversation”, Andy Smith and Amund Sjølie Sveen’s Commonism is performance as an invitation to listen, to collectively take up space and to spend time imagining a future far different from our precarious present. They propose that commonism, as a principle or an idea, offers a potential future of both radical equality and radical freedom.For an hour, sitting at either side of a table, Smith and Sveen perform a scripted conversation distilled from their own lengthier exchanges. Pages are turned and ideas genially debated: economic systems and wealth distribution, politics and the demos, nations and borders, labour and automation.I doubt that much here would be new or controversial to anyone with a slightly left-leaning bent or a passing interest in the state of the world. There is, however, an open acknowledgment of the privileges that allow for two white, middle-aged men to stage a subsidised chat for a paying audience. And there is an understanding that an equal future for which they advocate will rightly necessitate that the stage be ceded to others.However, while Commonism might sedately look towards the horizon, in the interplay between its minimal theatricality and a sincere commitment to actual shared presence and collective potential, it also guilefully interrogates its limitations, politically and performatively.Smith and Sveen’s conversation culminates in the distribution of a handbook that contains the principles of commonism. Shifting from staged conversation to proclamation, copies are distributed to the audience. Read after the performance, unencumbered by even the most minimal theatrical trappings, one is struck by the text’s difference in register and how these ideas might now function beyond the stage. It is not a step-by-step guide, but having negated their own theatricality, these ideas, even abstractly, feel concrete and of the world. They sincerely invite us to do with them as they will.The manifesto features a quote from Sara Ahmed’s Living a Feminist Life, reminding us that “we” is “not a foundation but what we are working toward”.

Were you baffled? I had never heard the expression until then.Neither had I actually. But yes it\u0027s explained in the script - what I\u0027m trying to prevent from happening. It\u0027s also possible that John Waters made it up which is entirely like him.Are there any particular roles or alternative career directions you would like to take in the future?I never can think of particular roles I want to do. Although I think there are a bunch of men\u0027s roles that I wish I could do. As far as alternative career directions, as I mentioned before, I\u0027m deeply interested in pursuing tracking as a discipline not necessarily a career. In a funny way it lends itself to what I do as an actor. When you\u0027re tracking an animal (not for the purposes of hunting, which I am profoundly opposed to as a sport) you have to put yourself in its paws, so to speak. It requires empathy, listening, an ability to focus on the micro as well as the macro, to zoom in on detail while also taking in the bigger picture. And even if you don\u0027t locate the animal or if you can\u0027t ultimately find it, it\u0027s as though you\u0027re in conversation with that animal, which I find profoundly magical, for lack of a better word. Pursuing tracking has actually, I think, made me a better actor. It\u0027s certainly reinvigorated my interest in my job. I could say it\u0027s reawakened something in me that I think I had perhaps lost touch with, having been doing this for so many years. So I hope to continue doing it as a way of maintaining contact with a part of myself that I need access to in order to be good at my job.How did you break into film acting? One understands it’s a rather tricky business to get into.When I was 11, somehow I was cast in a series of Calvin Klein commercials by the legendary photographer Richard Avedon. It was through these commercials that I came to the attention of the makers of a film called The River Rat with Tommy Lee Jones and Brian Dennehy. I auditioned and got the part. I was 12 and it was my first lead role in a film. And that\u0027s that.Just this morning you have deleted your Twitter account! Can I politely ask you why? I know it’s awful. We all know it’s awful. We can take breaks from the dreadful humans on it, but deletion seems extreme. You are one of the finest voices on there. You make me smile and you shut down the rightwing loons with grace and aplomb. Please reconsider. Also, what’s your favourite David Bowie album?I deleted my Twitter account because I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s useful and I don\u0027t know who I\u0027m speaking to when I\u0027m on it. I don\u0027t want to share a platform with an ignoramus imbecile despot who is systematically destroying everything decent about my country. I don\u0027t believe that whatever good comes out of Twitter ultimately is of any consequence. It\u0027s there and then it\u0027s gone. It just feels like yammering through a megaphone into a void and I find myself feeling like a jabbering egotist when I use it. That\u0027s the honest truth. I also don\u0027t want to share a platform with racists and hate-mongers and Nazis and people who use it to threaten other people\u0027s lives and insult them and harm them. I just don\u0027t see the point. And, right now, Station to Station is my favourite Bowie.Having been an environmental activist, do you think there is much hope for us all looking at the current situation? I mean, how do you accept what is going on in the US? Do you believe that theatre still has a place in raising awareness or are you just preaching to the converted? Is it even important anymore? PS, I loved Running on Empty.First of all, you sound depressed. I can relate! It\u0027s very easy to feel defeated and that our utter destruction is inevitable. Particularly now. Which is why I feel that theatre is as important as it ever was - if not more. If you\u0027re preaching to the converted, it doesn\u0027t matter. Because it\u0027s not about preaching. It\u0027s not as grand as that. A person\u0027s experience while watching a play is completely private and personal - you have no idea what\u0027s going on in their head. Even if they hated it they could be changed in some monumental or microscopic way. The human mind is a very mysterious and beautiful thing. New connections get made all the time. So there\u0027s always hope.Your introductory scene in The Goonies features you standing on a jetty, dunking your head in a barrel of water and pulling out a giant crab, yet it’s never explained why. Was something important edited out of this scene, along with the similarly ditched giant octopus and escaped gorilla subplots?I don\u0027t remember the gorilla thing! But the idea behind the crab was that I was helping out with my family\u0027s fishing business. I think.Why did you take your mother’s surname and not your father’s?My parents weren\u0027t together when I was born and my mother raised me and they never married so it seemed the logical thing to do.Loved your scenes with Dianne Wiest in Parenthood, and have found you always bring a particular quality to your roles. Given the essential silliness of acting, do you find it hard to maintain the interest and energy in new projects? And does it become a job like any other, or do you still find it exciting?Well, first of all, if I may, kind sir or madam: I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything silly about acting at all! It\u0027s one of the oldest professions there is besides prostitution and wildlife tracking. In fact I think they go in this order: wildlife tracking, acting, prostitution. Three noble careers. And yes sometimes it is hard to be excited about a job if it feels like something you\u0027ve done a lot before or if it doesn\u0027t feel like a new take on something. But I try not to lose sight of the fact that to have a job at all makes me a very fortunate member of my community. And being able to pay the bills is also satisfying. In all seriousness, I love my job and I\u0027m very lucky I get to keep doing it.Thank you for this question - I don\u0027t find the subject sensitive at all. It\u0027s never been a factor in my work life. I\u0027ve never been asked to keep quiet by any employer or potential employer or by my representatives. The majority of thinking iniduals agree that reproductive healthcare is a human right. You can be certain that were anyone to ask me to keep quiet about it, I wouldn\u0027t work for them - so they\u0027d be at a loss not me.Good or bad memories of Shy People? I am a big fan of this overlooked classic.Thank you very much. This isn\u0027t a movie I talk about much any more so I\u0027m happy to know that you enjoyed it and remember it. It was a really hard movie to make. We filmed it almost entirely in a swamp in Louisiana but I really loved working there and I really loved working with Jill Clayburgh and with my one-time aunt Barbara Hershey. Two phenomenal actresses who I think of often and fondly. I had my 16th birthday while filming that movie. It was one of the best birthdays I\u0027ve ever had. We had a crab boil and a zydeco band and the whole crew came out to this house in the middle of the swamp. It was a really incredible experience.I bought you a glass of wine at a gig in Dalston about a month ago. My question is: did you enjoy the glass of wine? My other question is: do you mind people buying you a glass of wine because they go mad that you were in the Goonies? All the best.Yes! I am certain I did enjoy the glass of wine. No, I don\u0027t mind people buying me glasses of wine because they go mad that I am in The Goonies although if I had known that at the time, I wouldn\u0027t have accepted it. God knows what you would have put in there.Do you like marmalade?I am a huge marmalade fan. I love marmalade and I eat it almost every time I put anything on my toast.Any chance of Sweat transferring to the West End? I failed to get tickets and would love to see you in the play. Also I loved The Real O’Neals. Looked like a lot of fun to make. Was it as much fun on set as it appeared to be on screen?There are ways to get tickets! Every Monday at noon there are \u0027klaxon\u0027 tickets starting at £10. There\u0027s sometimes a queue on the Donmar website but people have got tickets that way. If you\u0027re under 25 there\u0027s also \u0027young + free\u0027 tickets which are donated by members of the theatre and others. And there\u0027s always cancellations. So come to the theatre and hang out up until curtain time and you may get a seat. It\u0027s also worth noting that if you are a member already or have already bought your tickets, the Donmar can\u0027t legally put anyone in your seat if you don\u0027t show up so please call and cancel your seats and get a refund if you can\u0027t go, so someone else can go in your stead. It\u0027s no fun seeing empty seats in the theatre! As for a transferextension, watch this space...I saw you from the first row on stage in Sweat, and I was stricken by how precise your acting is, even in ways that would be imperceptible to the largest part of a theatre audience. That made me wonder: how does acting on screen compare to acting on stage? Do you inhabit your character in the same ways, or do you emphasise different things, a different physicality?That\u0027s a really good question. They are two different skillsets even though I think having a solid sense of stagecraft is helpful when you\u0027re in front of a camera. I work mostly on television now when I\u0027m on camera. I\u0027ve only made a couple of indie films in the last few years. I like TV work because it\u0027s fast. You\u0027re free to be somewhat more expressive. But that could be just a matter of the roles I play. There isn\u0027t a lot of film work for character actresses so I feel freer onstage and in television where there\u0027s a greater variety of things I can do.Whatwho is your spirit animal?I think this whole spirit animal thing is really overdone. BUT I love elephants. In fact, I love animals in general. As far as spirit goes, before I came here to do this play I studied tracking in the bush in Botswana. Which is something I intend to continue studying.Hi everybody! I\u0027m really excited to be here and ready to answer some of your questions... Let\u0027s get this show on the road!Martha Plimpton was just 14, and had already modelled for Calvin Klein, when she starred in her breakthrough film, the rollicking treasure hunt The Goonies. She shone as Stef, one of the savviest underground adventurers in the box-office hit. Acting is the family trade: her parents are Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton.That decade, Martha appeared alongside River Phoenix in The Mosquito Coast and Running on Empty, and stood out in the comedy Parenthood. Her later films include A Woman at War (playing a Belgian resistance fighter during the second world war), Stanley \u0026amp Iris, Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle, I Shot Andy Warhol, and the John Waters film Pecker, in a role as the big-haired MC of a gay go-go bar.Martha has had award-winning roles in the TV series The Good Wife and Raising Hope, and has performed in plays by Tom Stoppard (The Coast of Utopia), Caryl Churchill (Top Girls) and Edward Albee (A Delicate Balance) on Broadway. She was last seen on the London stage in 2014 at the Old Vic, in Other Desert Cities.Now, she’s back in London at the Donmar Warehouse starring in the five-star smash Sweat, a Pulitzer prize-winner by Lynn Nottage. Michael Billington called it a “breathtaking” drama that “shows the anger and despair that helped fuel the election of Donald Trump”.

The charity noted that while there had been similar incidents in the past, there has been a spike in sightings in recent weeks.“Those that do survive and arrive at our centre are always in a very bad state, and are so malnourished and distressed that we have had to humanely euthanise them,” the SPCA’s spokesperson Paige Janssen told the BBC.Janssen said there had been several reported cases of “decorated” birds since 2015 but the number of sightings had increased over the Christmas and New Year period.“We received around 30 calls alone just over this period. They were multiple sightings of a dozen birds that are still mobile and flying around the Kilbirnie area that we are unable to reach,” she said.On Wednesday a property was searched in an attempt to find the so-called Wellington sparrow killer and the local SPCA said it was looking for the suspect behind this “case of cruelty”. Last week it put out an appeal for information.The SPCA general manager for the central region, Ros Alsford, told the New Zealand Herald that decorated pigeons were removed from the property on Wednesday, and brought to its hospital where they were given a check and had the trinkets removed.She said the birds were incredibly distressed when first brought in but were fine now. “They were in OK health, the vets gave them a good health check. And once we removed the trinkets we sent them back to the property … The reason we did that is they were sitting on nests of eggs so we had to return them back to their nests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/451e2ee52374d700a9bce6aa26dbda2a411ab4ab/0_112_1544_926/master/1544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b75e4c5ed0aa7ec489741a70e7f7d422","title":"china to let thousands of ethnic kazakhs leave xinjiang","story":"Kazakh foreign ministry says they will be allowed to drop their Chinese citizenshipChina is allowing more than 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs to abandon their Chinese citizenship and leave the country, the Kazakh foreign ministry has said, in a sign that Beijing may be starting to feel a mounting backlash against its crackdown on Muslims in the far west region of Xinjiang.The detention of Uighur, Kazakh and other ethnic minorities in internment camps has been an issue in neighbouring Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country of 18 million people. China is a major trading partner, and Kazakhstan’s state media had generally avoided reporting on it. But activists say pressure for action has slowly built following international media coverage.The foreign ministry press office confirmed Kazakh media reports from December that China had agreed to let more than 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs leave. It did not say who could leave or why. They will be allowed to apply for Kazakh citizenship or permanent residency after their arrival in Kazakhstan, the email said.The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Chinese authorities in Xinjiang have launched a massive surveillance and detention campaign that has swept as many as a million people into internment camps. Former detainees have said they were forced to renounce their culture and faith and subjected to political indoctrination.The detentions have sent a chill over a tight-knit community of Chinese-born Kazakhs living in Kazakhstan. Many had left China to pursue business opportunities or educate their children in Kazakh schools as restrictions tightened in Xinjiang.Hundreds lost contact with relatives in Xinjiang, and many began writing letters and attending media conferences, hoping that greater publicity would help bring their loved ones home.Serikzhan Bilash, the head of the Kazakh advocacy group Atajurt, said he was warned by officials to halt his activities four times this summer but the warnings later stopped. In December, he was invited onto a popular Kazakh talk show for an hour, indicating growing tolerance of his work publicising the plight of detained Kazakhs.“I said that Chinese officials are dangerous for central Asia, for Kazakhstan,” Bilash said. “They’re starting to accept my opinion now.”Chinese officials announced last week that while they would not back down on what it sees as a highly successful de-radicalisation program, fewer people would be sent through.Gene Bunin, an activist who has collected about 2,000 testimonies from relatives of detainees in Xinjiang, estimated that about 20 people, possibly more, were allowed to return to Kazakhstan last year. Bunin has tracked another 70 or so who have been released from camps but confined to their home villages and prevented from leaving the country.“They’ve been getting released since September,” said Bunin, who lived in Xinjiang until last year. “I suspect it’s sort of an appeasement thing going on, where they’re trying to satisfy the relatives, to defuse tensions.”Those allowed to return so far have been largely Kazakh citizens or those with spouses or children born in Kazakhstan.One 23-year-old Kazakh citizen, who asked to be identified by her nickname Guli to protect her family from retribution, was able to return from Xinjiang in July after being separated from her husband and two children for more than two years. She said she broke down in tears after a Kazakh official called to say she might be able to return.“I thought I’d never be able to go back to Kazakhstan again, that I wouldn’t able to see my kids again,” she said. “I had lost all hope.”In recent months, Chinese-born Kazakhs in Kazakhstan have started to hear that their relatives in Xinjiang were being released from the camps. However, most of the relatives remain in Xinjiang under unclear circumstances, unable to leave for Kazakhstan.“I want to find a way to bring my entire family over to Kazakhstan,” said Adilgazy Yergazy, who heard one of his younger brothers had been released on 24 December but has not been able to leave China. “They’re all very scared.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbc7f86edd730f2a6e7a4c4b0355b75ae0744d4/0_48_9000_5400/master/9000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62fbb57f081c00ee6bb534ee68fdf983","title":"oxfam criticises eu inhumane lesbos refugee camp moria","story":"Violence so bad that women wear nappies at night to avoid leaving tents, report saysThe EU has been strongly criticised over conditions in Greece’s largest refugee camp, where Oxfam reported women are wearing nappies at night for fear of leaving their tents to go to the toilet.The British-based NGO described the increasingly dangerous state of the EU-sponsored Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, where a 24-year-old man from Cameroon was found dead in the early hours of Tuesday as temperatures fell below freezing.Under a landmark deal agreed between the EU and Turkey in March 2016 to reduce the number of people arriving into the continent, refugees seeking asylum on Greek islands have been forbidden from leaving “hotspot” camps to travel to the mainland.Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, has hailed the deal as a success for thwarting smuggling gangs and reducing migratory flows.But as a result, about 15,000 men, women and children are stranded in Lesbos, Chios, Kos, Samos and Leros, the islands closest to Turkey.The report from Oxfam titled Vulnerable and Abandoned highlighted the failure of authorities at the Moria camp, where nearly 5,000 people live, to identify vulnerable refugees who are eligible for help.Since the resignation in November of the government-appointed doctor designated to make assessments of asylum seekers’ wellbeing, Oxfam claimed these failed to take place for at least a month at Moria, which at times last year was home to three times the number of people it was designed for.As a result, Oxfam warned “vulnerable people including survivors of torture and sexual violence are being housed in unsafe areas … Pregnant women and mothers with newborns are left sleeping in tents, and unaccompanied children, wrongly registered as adults, have been placed in detention.”Mothers are said to have been sent away from hospital to live in a tent as early as four days after giving birth by caesarian section, in a camp where fights break out regularly and two-thirds of residents say they never feel safe.“In a few extreme cases, women say they have resorted to wearing diapers at night to avoid having to go to the toilet after dark,” the report said.One woman, 36, from Cameroon, told Oxfam that people were randomly attacked at the camp.“Moria is a dangerous place for women,” she said. “Fights can start at any moment. At any moment you can expect a stone to your head, even if you’re just walking to the toilet or to your tent … I live in the closed section for women who are alone, but after 11pm the door is open, and anyone can come in because there is no security guard at night. Safety is a big issue for us.”A 24-year-old woman from Afghanistan said: “In the winter there is no warm water. We take showers over the toilet.”Renata Rendón, Oxfam’s head of mission in Greece, said: “It is irresponsible and reckless to fail to recognise the most vulnerable people and respond to their needs.“Our partners have met mothers with newborn babies sleeping in tents, and teenagers wrongly registered as adults being locked up. Surely identifying and providing for the needs of such people is the most basic duty of the Greek government and its European partners.”Rendón added: “European leaders have to face the fact that their current policy is perpetuating an inhumane reception system and putting refugees at risk. Rather than continuing to focus all their efforts on returning refugees to Turkey under the deal struck in 2016, EU member states should support Greece to improve conditions in the island camps and move people off the overcrowded islands and on to the mainland.”People seeking asylum are normally expected to undergo vulnerability assessments soon after arrival on the islands, but the medical and psychosocial screenings at Moria have been described as cursory at best due to a “severe shortage” of staff.Oxfam reported that for “many months”, there was just one doctor employed by the Greek government at the camp to assess the health conditions of as many as 2,000 new arrivals in one month, before the medic eventually quit.Even refugees identified as vulnerable and theoretically allowed to leave the islands are being trapped due to a lack of accommodation on the mainland, it is claimed.According to UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, more than 4,000 people eligible for transfer were stuck in Lesbos and Samos in November.The slow asylum application process is also said to be condemning families to years in the camps, where people live in tents without hot water and electricity during winter.“Due to a lack of staff, many people who arrive now in Lesbos have their first asylum interview scheduled for 2020,” Oxfam reported.For some, open fires are reportedly the only way to keep warm in winter. The burning of plastic bags and bottles is said to create a “dangerous, smoky, acrid atmosphere”.Three asylum seekers died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the camp in January 2017 while trying to stay warm with makeshift stoves.Since September, about 11,000 asylum seekers have been transferred by ferry and coach to hotels and apartments on the mainland in an EU-funded scheme overseen by UNHCR.Stella Nanou, a spokesperson for the agency in Athens, said: “While efforts have been intensified to transfer people and Moria’s population has fallen below 5,000 for the first time since April last year, it is still twice over capacity.“There are people, vulnerable people, families and children, living in totally unsuitable conditions in the biting cold. We’re talking about human beings. The situation is very bad, very grave.”A commission spokesman said it had made €289m (£260m) available to the Greek government to “support migration management” and was following the situation on the Greek islands closely as the weather deteriorated.“We have repeatedly alerted the Greek authorities about the very challenging situation in the Greek islands and pointed to the urgency to address this situation, while always ensuring the availability of EU funds to help face those challenges,” the spokesman said.“Of course, the overall responsibility for managing migration flows in Greece, including in the hotspots, rests with the Greek administration. The commission provides support it does not replace the Greek authorities.“There is in particular an urgent need to winterise reception capacity and to decongest the islands by accelerating asylum procedures and increasing returns in parallel to the ongoing efforts to transfer those migrants to the mainland whose geographical restrictions have been lifted.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e6d5557f698f05a8783e2679858df54a16ba6bc/0_131_900_540/master/900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc81c0db2991bcc0f017133c2cf4b0f2","title":"post metoo have the likes of kevin hart and aziz ansari learned from their mistakes","story":"Can we expect a new era of equality? Not if the first public utterances by some of the early offenders are anything to go byNew year, new start! After all the exciting social upheavals last year such as #MeToo, it’s all change now, right? Diana, by emailOh, Diana. Your optimism is beautiful, shining like a beacon in the apocalyptic wasteland of cynicism in which we now find ourselves. Sadly, snuff it out I must. It was all terribly exciting this time last year, as we watched powerful people being called out for behaviours that had always been wrong but – for reasons no one can explain now – they had been able to get away with until literally last year. Sexism, racism, harassment and even flat-out rape: they were all denounced, as previously marginalised, or at least less powerful, people finally took a stand against powerful men, and – more importantly – they were believed. Even if we didn’t win all the fights, even if Brett “I didn’t write: ‘Sexually assault someone’ on my calendar case closed!” Kavanaugh is, incredibly, on the supreme court, despite Christine Blasey-Ford’s powerful testimony that he assaulted her as a teenager, it still felt like a watershed had been reached. Truly, we thought, men had learned their lesson. Oh, brave new dawn of sexual equality!Aaaand – as they say in the movies – scene. The sequel rarely lives up to the original because there is always a sense of anticlimax seeing what happens after the original’s euphoric ending scene. And what is happening here is a definite letdown. It turns out that the men have not learned their lesson. No, in fact, they think they have been wronged. Because nothing is more unfair than being called on out on your behaviour, it seems.Hart is not alone in his resistance to self-examination. Aziz Ansari is back doing standup almost a year after he was accused by a woman of … well, let’s just call it “less than ideal behaviour on a date”, note that he was “surprised and concerned” by her account and get to the matter at hand. Once Ansari styled himself as Mr Woke, writing a book called Modern Romance, wearing Time’s Up pins to red-carpet events and so on. But according to the New York Times, his latest show’s theme is “contempt for people trying to outwoke each other”. Ah, how fast the woke turn when wokeness turns against them!The same could be said of Louis CK. Once, he did brilliant routines about how men were so dangerous to women that a woman agreeing to date with one was like him having to agree to a date with “a half-bear and half-lion and thinking: ‘I hope this one’s nice!’” Alas, it has since been revealed he is less than nice, having admitted – after years of denials – to masturbating in front of horrified women. A clip of his latest routine was recently leaked in which he mocked, of all people, the survivors of the Parkland shooting, confirming that CK hasn’t quite grasped who’s who in the whole predator-victim nexus.Now, no one can dictate how someone should react to being publicly shamed and vilified. But it would be nice if at least some of these men could spend, I don’t know, two minutes examining their culpability, instead of running away from such reflections in terror and lashing out at the world, like a toddler who can’t deal with being told off for being mean to his baby sister so he hits his mother. I don’t ask for much, guys. But I will ask for adult men to be better than toddlers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/457d6ece11fadc21725ec58e19c75bbd928b17c7/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c8e7b7044c9ced21a8aeac47a9848f","title":"venezuela nicolas maduro second term neighbours latin america","story":"The leftwing president is isolated in a region lurching to the right but despite national crisis a direct intervention is unlikelyIn a televised new year’s message to his atrophying nation, Nicolás Maduro struck an upbeat tone. “Victory awaits us! The future awaits us! And everything will be better!” Venezuela’s embattled president insisted, declaring 2019 “the year of fresh starts”.But the sandbags and rifle-toting troops that now encircle the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas suggest far less confidence about the days ahead, as Venezuela sinks deeper into economic ruin and political isolation and questions grow over Maduro’s future.Hugo Chávez’s 56-year-old heir – narrowly elected after his mentor’s 2013 death and then again in disputed elections last May – will begin his second presidential term on Thursday, amid intensifying international condemnation of what critics call his illegitimate and authoritarian rule.Last week, a regional bloc known as the Lima Group turned up the heat, with 13 of its 14 members announcing they would not recognise Maduro’s new six-year term and urging him to step down. Those countries included Brazil, whose new far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is well-known for his hostility to Maduro and whose pro-Trump foreign minister recently called for Venezuela’s “liberation”.The US has also stepped up pressure ahead of what it calls Maduro’s “sham inauguration” with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, telling one Brazilian newspaper “several things” could be done to rid Venezuela of Maduro’s “unacceptable” regime. Pompeo did not specify what those “things” might be but the remark echoed Donald Trump’s thinly veiled threat that military action was possible if Maduro did not go voluntarily.Despite the rhetorical war – Maduro recently ordered his troops to prepare to rip out the hearts of “imperialist” invaders – observers still consider a foreign military intervention unlikely.“I don’t see boots on the ground,” said Matias Spektor, an international relations specialist from Brazil’s Getúlio Vargas Foundation.But after years of dawdling, regional patience does appear to be running out, as the situation in Venezuela deteriorates and Latin American politics swerves to the right under leaders such as Bolsonaro, Colombia’s Iván Duque, Chile’s Sebastián Piñera and Argentina’s Mauricio Macri.“The dynamics are changing and they are changing very fast,” said Spektor, calling the rise of those politicians decidedly bad news for Maduro.Spektor said the Lima Group’s unexpectedly firm declaration – which includes plans for financial sanctions, preventing top Venezuela officials entering their countries, and suspending military cooperation – appeared partly designed to persuade the Venezuelan military to abandon their commander-in-chief.“For the regime to collapse you need to get Maduro out of the country and you need to get the military to stop supporting the regime … The way you do that is by sending signals to the military that in the long run if they stick to Maduro and the regime they will lose power,” he said.Latin American governments did not want regime change imposed by outsiders “because they know full well it would backfire – but they do want to see regime change via peaceful means”.Under its new leftist president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico has resisted joining the anti-Maduro offensive, a move decried by human rights activists and Venezuela’s opposition. “I don’t stick my nose into other countries’ affairs,” López Obrador said last week, emphasizing Mexico’s return to a foreign policy of non-intervention.But most Latin American countries are moving in the opposite direction, leaving Maduro increasingly friendless in a region his Bolivarian predecessor, Hugo Chávez, dreamed of uniting during the “pink tide” era of leftist rule.Brazil, in particular, looks poised to play a frontline role in the diplomatic push to force Venezuela’s president out. “In the early days of the administration, my understanding is that people in the Bolsonaro government want to send a very clear and unequivocal signal that Maduro’s costs in the region are about to go up,” said Spektor.Brazil’s foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, hinted at that harder line this week arguing: “You have to face the threats, and the main one comes from non-democratic regimes that export crime, instability and oppression. You can’t simply wish away dictatorships such as Venezuela and Cuba.”David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said there was a growing sense that with the end of Maduro’s first term and growing regional pressure the crisis was entering a new phase: “But nobody really knows just exactly what it amounts to.“It’s one thing to say: ‘You’re illegitimate’. But how much does that mean in the end? It doesn’t look like any of the Lima Group members or the United States are going to close up their embassies or break off diplomatic relations,” he said.Maduro and his inner circle would be fretting over their increasing isolation “and that’s why you see them reaching out to the Russians and the Chinese continually”, Smilde said. But any international effort to engineer a peaceful transition would founder unless Venezuela’s fractured opposition united.“Until that happens, the government can kind of do whatever it wants – even a weak government can consolidate if it has no opposition.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb1362a73daa1cd2ebfae3032bb40b3ce20d2c0b/0_23_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f14a06aaa76893672f30e0220e8c04d0","title":"what does 2019 hold for kim jong un and north korea podcast","story":"Kim Jong-un goes into 2019 with momentum to build on after last year’s historic meeting with President Donald Trump.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has described as “cosmetic and meaningless” a British government proposal that would give the Northern Assembly a “strong role” if the backstop to prevent a hard North-South border was ever triggered.On Wednesday the British government published a paper pledging to implement a legally-binding commitment to consult Stormont if by 2020 an EU-UK trade deal failed to materialise.The British cabinet office minister David Lidington said the proposal amounted to giving the Northern Assembly a “veto”.Ahead of publication of the paper he told the BBC: “We are publishing today a set of Northern Ireland-specific proposals that make clear the continuing place of Northern Ireland within the UK internal market and which will give the Northern Ireland Assembly, when as we all hope it is reconstituted and working again, a veto over introducing any new areas of law and policy into that backstop.” The paper was published on the second anniversary of the late Martin McGuinness resigning as the Norther’s Deputy First Minister, precipitating the collapse of the Northern Executive and Assembly.Shortly after the paper was published Mr Dodds made clear that it would not win the support of the party’s 10 MPs who are propping up Theresa May’s government and who the prime minister is hoping can be persuaded to support the EU-UK withdrawal agreement.“The proposal to ensure ‘a strong role for the Northern Ireland Assembly’ before Northern Ireland specific backstop provisions are given effect is cosmetic and meaningless,” said Mr Dodds.“The Assembly would not be able to override UK international legal obligations as the backstop provisions would be in the treaty,” he added.“The government is aware that we will not countenance anything which places Northern Ireland’s place within the internal market of the United Kingdom at risk and which creates significant new regulatory ergence risks within the UK,” he said. “Our position on all these matters has not changed. We will continue to work to secure a better deal in the time ahead,” said Mr Dodds.He added: “We reject the backstop and have previously, and consistently, indicated we will not support an internationally legally binding withdrawal agreement that contains its provisions. Such an international treaty supersedes and overrides any contrary domestic legal provisions.” The Ulster Unionist Party MEP Jim Nicholson said the new proposals to give a restored Assembly a role in any backstop arrangement as “toothless given that there will be no change to the legally binding text of the withdrawal agreement”.“These proposals fall well short of what is necessary - which is change to the legally binding text of the withdrawal agreement. Up against a legally binding international treaty, this so-called ‘veto’ is merely window dressing and frankly toothless,” he said.Mr Nicholson added: “If the government does indeed now accept the fact that the backstop will have serious constitutional and democratic implications for Northern Ireland, why is it not pursuing the changes to the legally binding text necessary to garner support for the deal across the United Kingdom?”In a paper published on Wednesday outlining a series of commitments specific to the North, the British government said if a wider EUUK trade deal fails to materialise by the end of the Implementation Period in 2020, there would be a legally-binding commitment to “consult” with Stormont before deciding to either enter the backstop or ask for an extension of the Implementation Period. The view of the Assembly would then be presented to the British parliament before MPs took a final decision on the issue. If the backstop does come into effect, the British government said the Stormont Assembly and Executive would then be given a strong oversight role in its operation. If the EU proposed changing any laws that impacted the operating of the backstop, the UK would have to consent to such a measure applying to Northern Ireland and the British government has now committed to seek the agreement of the Assembly before signing off on any such change.The British government has also offered politicians in Northern Ireland a role in influencing its approach to a number of joint UKEU forums that will be established to oversee the Withdrawal Agreement. It said it would agree a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with any future Stormont Executive setting out the devolved administration’s role in respect of the three main bodies — the Joint Committee, the Specialised Committee on the Northern Ireland Protocol and the Joint Consultative Working Group. The British government paper stated: “This will apply solely to Northern Ireland-specific issues — UK-wide provisions are rightly a matter for the UK Government. “The MoU would agree the appropriate UK delegation to those forums when Northern Ireland-specific issues are being discussed. “It would also set out the agreed processes and forums to ensure effective dialogue and information-sharing with the Executive on the implementation of the protocol. “This would ensure that the Northern Ireland voice was represented and heard at each level of the institutional structures that would give effect to the protocol.” - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

My apartment looks on to the government ministry that was invaded by insurgents driving a hijacked forklift truck on January 5th.The protest movement turned insurrection has come too close for comfort.I returned from a year-end holiday to find my neighbourhood in central Paris transformed. “The Future”, says graffiti on a shop in the boulevard St Germain, next to the circular A symbol of anarchy.The windows of my local Société Générale bank are shattered.The Banque Nationale de Paris protected its windows with plywood, on which the rioters listed the bank’s supposed sins, including “climaticide” and fomenting war in Sudan.Broken glass carpeted the street outside the cafe where I ate my first 2019 meal in Paris. I walked home past a scorched motorcycle, lying like a dead insect in front of Yves Saint Laurent headquarters.My Spanish concierge was traumatised by watching rubbish bins burning on the corner.My newspaper vendor said the yellow vests went on the rampage in our neighbourhood because they were pushed this direction by security forces.Most days, I go outside to find dozens of police vans lined up in surrounding streets. It’s like living in an armed camp.When the protests started in November, shops and banks would put plywood sheets over their windows late on Friday, then remove them on Sunday.Now they leave the protective siding in place, giving central Paris the allure of a shanty town.On December 29th, turnout for the protests dwindled to 12,000 nationwide. Many heaved a sigh of relief in the mistaken belief that the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement had been defused by president Emmanuel Macron’s promise of €10 billion to increase purchasing power.But on January 5th, 50,000 gilets jaunes came back with a vengeance. The demonstrations have morphed from a protest at (now cancelled) fuel taxes to a seditious movement that is determined to bring down the government.Prime minister Edouard Philippe announced on Monday night that he will deploy 80,000 police and gendarmes for “Act 9” on January 12th.But will hardcore anarchists and vandals really be deterred by legislation that would create a register for violent demonstrators, similar to the one for football hooligans?One of the most shocking images from the January 5th riots showed Christophe Dettinger (37), a former boxing champion, kicking a policeman on the ground on the Solferino footbridge over the Seine, and pummelling another policeman in the face.Dettinger had “liked” a photograph of Marion Maréchal, the rising star of the French far right, on his Facebook page. He risks five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.His supporters raised €117,000 for his defence by Tuesday morning, before the crowdfunding\u0026nbsp platform Leetchi closed the fund down. A similar fund, set up for the 1,050 police who have been wounded in riots, raised far less.In the old Guignols de l’info television show, the puppet version of former Trotskyist leader Arlette Laguiller promised in a soft voice to “string the bourgeois up by their entrails”.At three Christmas dinners I attended in Paris, I detected a frisson of fear in the French bourgeoisie, a premonition that we’d all be strung up.Virtually everyone I know likes Macron and detests the gilets jaunes. I could not understand why polls showed such high support for the protesters, until a colleague reminded me that in Paris, Macron won 90 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election.Bourgeois means, literally, town-dweller. Most of the gilets jaunes are from the neglected countryside.Not by chance, they are attacking Paris, seat of the hated government, home to the ruling elite.On Monday, Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the populist Italian Five Star movement, urged the gilets jaunes, “Don’t let up!” His partner in government, Matteo Salvini, the head of the extreme right-wing League, expressed his support for “honest citizens who are protesting against a president ruling against his own people”.Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN), formerly Front National, and an ally of Salvini, is the Chesire cat of the gilets jaunes movement. She is almost invisible, except for her smile.The demands made by RN in a statement this week are virtually identical to those of the gilets jaunes: the dissolution of the National Assembly and new elections based on proportional representation, which would probably hand the RN a third of the seats in the French legislature."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3752316.1547036095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps seek to force theresa may to present brexit plan b","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May leaving  Downing Street on Wednesday. Photograph: Neil HallEPAMPs will seek to force Theresa May to come up with a plan B on Brexit within days if her deal is defeated in parliament next week, in a further sign of growing rebellion at Westminster.An amendment supported by a cross-party group including nine Conservative rebels such as Dominic Grieve and Jo Johnson would force the British prime minister to present an alternative plan within three sitting days if the vote is lost on Tuesday.That would accelerate the Brexit timetable, and potentially prevent Mrs May from engaging in parliamentary brinkmanship. If the Commons votes in favour, the government’s ability to shape the Brexit process – and to ensure Mrs May’s deal is effectively the last plan standing – would be curtailed.Under existing legislation, Mrs May would have three weeks to come up with another Brexit plan, allowing her to run down the clock to exit day and increasing the chance of a no-deal Brexit.MPs are expected to vote on that proposal at about 1pm UK time on Wednesday. The vote, which comes ahead of five days of parliamentary debate on Mrs May’s deal, is the latest move by MPs to assert their control over the Brexit process.Wednesday’s amendment, if successful, would be a victory for Mr Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general and a backer of a second Brexit referendum. It would also worsen relations between the government and the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow.Government officials had expected Mr Bercow to refuse to allow MPs to vote on Mr Grieve’s amendment to the Commons business motion, because it was “out of order”.But the speaker, who has a history of clashes with the government and of pushing the rights of backbenchers, selected the amendment anyway. One government official complained that the speaker had acted “against the advice of his clerks”.However, the Stormont assembly has not functioned since 2017, because of differences between the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist party and Sinn Fein. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

It also forbids altering the anthem\u0027s lyrics and its score. As well as possible jail time, offenders will also face fines of up to HK$50,000 (£5,000).Patrick Nip, secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs, told reporters the law would preserve the dignity of the national anthem and promote respect.Defiant Hong Kong football fans have booed the anthem at matches for years. Fans have also previously turned their backs and displayed banners advocating independence for the city, a notion that infuriates Beijing.Hong Kong\u0027s legal system is separate from the mainland under the 1997 handover agreement with Britain designed to guarantee the city\u0027s liberties for 50 years.Critics accuse China of reneging on that agreement, citing a variety of moves targeting the city\u0027s freedom of expression, including a crackdown on rebel lawmakers and activists.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Speaker under fire for clearing amendment to tie Theresa May\u0026#39s hands as she faces \u0026#39guerrilla war\u0026#39 from Tory rebelsPictured: Boy, 14, who collided with car before being stabbed to death becomes latest London knife victimThe Dominic Grieve amendment explained: Could it prevent a no deal Brexit? Managed no deal: What exactly does it mean for Brexit - and what will happen?Brexit explained: All your questions answered about the UK leaving the EU  What is Article 50?

Although Rami Malek is still nominated in the Best Actor category for his portrayal of frontman Freddie Mercury, the film itself lost out on the top prize, with the category instead being populated by BlacKkKlansman, The Favourite, Green Book, Roma, and A Star Is Born.The revelation has essentially reconfirmed that the Best Picture is prize is a two-horse race between Roma and A Star is Born. The latter’s lack of wins on Globes night – outside of the inevitable Best Song prize for “Shallow” – suggests Alfonso Cuarón’s Mexico-set drama has the edge, but the Baftas will be key in solidifying the real odds for Oscar night.Created with Sketch.The 15 best films of 2018 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film. On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Back in 2012, the howling omission of Olivia Colman from the Baftas’ Best Actress category, for her beautiful, devastating performance in Paddy Considine’s Tyrannosaur, made headlines. Her Peep Show co-star David Mitchell even called the decision “ridiculous”. When Meryl Streep went on to win for her role as Margaret Thatcher in The Iron Lady, in which Colman also appeared as Thatcher’s daughter Carol, she took to the podium and dubbed her co-star “inely gifted”.Clearly, she knew then what the Baftas have only now cottoned onto – that Colman was destined for greatness. Thank goodness they’ve not made the same mistake twice Colman is nominated, and will most likely win, for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite.As was the case with the Golden Globes, and as will no doubt be the case when the Oscar nominations are announced, there is not a sole woman on this year’s Best Director list. Where is Debra Granik’s nomination for Leave No Trace, her powerful, understated follow-up to Winter’s Bone? What about Marielle Heller, whose film, Can You Ever Forgive Me?, got an Adapted Screenplay nod, and earned Richard E Grant a Supporting Actor nomination.Perhaps the most disappointing omission, though, is You Were Never Really Here director Lynne Ramsey. Given that the Baftas are usually champions of homegrown talent, it seems they’ve missed an open goal by failing to give the Scottish filmmaker her due recognition.This year\u0027s Baftas nominations list in fullThe Favourite and A Star is Born dominate Bafta nominationsEverything you need to know about the 2019 BaftasOne of the less expected films to be honoured with several nominations here is Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, a passionate love story set in the ruins of post-war Poland, as a man and a woman from vastly different backgrounds – separated by both politics and the machinations of fate – cross paths. The film earned a nomination for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Not in the English Language.Pawlikowski won the award for Best Director at last year’s Cannes Film Festival and has been selected as Poland’s entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Whether it will earn nominations in any other categories at the Oscars is hard to guess.Given that this year, Brits dominated even at the Golden Globes, it would have been unforgivable for the Baftas to fail to recognise homegrown talent. The Favourite’s Rachel Weisz and First Man’s Claire Foy have earned Supporting Actress nominations, and of course The Favourite’s Olivia Colman has been nominated for Best Actress.As many surprised Golden Globes viewers were reminded earlier this week, Vice’s Christian Bale – nominated for Best Actor – is also, in fact, British, while this year’s obligatory idiosyncratic curveball is Steve Coogan’s nomination for Stan \u0026amp Ollie. The fact that there’s an Outstanding British Film category, meanwhile, means that brilliant films like Beast and You Were Never Really Here, which might otherwise have been ignored, get to share a little of the spotlight too.One of the more curious omissions from this year’s nominations is Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk, although it’s been recognised in both the categories for Original Music and Adapted Screenplay. The James Baldwin adaptation hasn’t quite picked up the same level of buzz as Jenkins’s previous film, Moonlight, although Regina King has so far been the favourite to win the Academy Award for Supporting Actress, so it’s unusual to see her not even make the nominations when it comes to the Baftas.Amy Adams, Claire Foy, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz have all been nominated as expected, King’s place in the category has apparently been taken by Margot Robbie for her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots – presumably a case of a little preferential bias for a Brit production.You can read the full nominations below.\u0026nbspHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of the 2019 Bafta nominations.\u0026nbspBlack Mirror: Bandersnatch\u0027s Will Poulter\u0026nbspand and I, Daniel Blake\u0027s Hayley Squires will reveal the nominations from the Baftas headquarters\u0026nbspnear Piccadilly Circus in London.\u0026nbspAnimated Film\u0026nbspIncredibles 2Isle of DogsSpider-Man: Into the Spider-VerseFollow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Its seasonal\u0026nbsptrading update rather cemented its\u0026nbspstatus as the supermarket sector’s current problem child.\u0026nbspCEO Mike Coupe said Christmas came late for the grocer. Critics immediately questioned whether it came at all.\u0026nbspSales for the 15 weeks to January 5 fell by 1.1 per cent excluding fuel, driven by a 2.3 per cent decline in general merchandise, for which read clothes and the stuff that Argos sells.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialSainsbury\u0027s, Asda playing with fire by taking CMA to judicial reviewSainsbury\u0027s labels items needed by food banksFood did better, but a 0.4 per cent increase is hardly anything to shout about.\u0026nbspThe chain is still seeing action at its convenience stores (up 3 per cent) and online (twice that).\u0026nbspBut those numbers only serve to underline how poorly its big supermarkets are faring.\u0026nbspWorryingly, the grocer is beginning to establish a reputation for foul ups.\u0026nbspOnline, customers have complained about empty shelves at some of the stores. Then there was the PR debacle of the recently launched ‘wellness’ hubs. The reception was less than positive, not least when high profile commentators spotted sugary cereal bars that were, mistakenly we were told, included in the range.Isolated incidents? Perhaps. But too many of them and you start to develop a decidedly unhealthy narrative. \u0026nbspAs for that general merchandise, Argos has on occasion showed itself to be one of the better arrows in Coupe’s bow, but Sainsbury’s decided it would go easy on Black Friday discounting with entirely predictable results.\u0026nbspThe only consolation? It could have been a lot worse. Asos, the online clothes retailer, chose the same course and ended up having to issue an ugly profit warning. Retailers not named Amazon must wish they could send the event back to the US from whence it came. They should be so lucky.\u0026nbspYet again Coupe’s Sainsbury’s has given the distinct impression that it is drifting, with its executives focused on driving through the controversial planned merger with Asda at the expense of the core business. The latter has also had its troubles but recently it has been showing signs of life and is starting to look like Sainsbury’s saviour.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The Chancellor has in the past a given the impression that he is well aware of the disastrous impact of a no deal Brexit. There is little doubt that he is equally well aware that the May deal is a dismal one that will make Britain poorer\u0026nbspand leave him, and his successors, struggling to find the funds needed to address Britain’s deep seated problems.But faced with the choice of being honest about it or\u0026nbspindulging\u0026nbspin the cynicism that has become such a depressing feature of this administration, he opted for the latter.Quelle surprise, you might say. But he\u0026nbspshould still\u0026nbspbe ashamed of himself. Sadly, it\u0026nbspseems there’s no shame to be had in the halls of a government that is bent upon scorching the earth of the country it is supposed to be running.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop.

The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CH“My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power,” she continued in the statement on her website. “I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The British empire was seen by others around the globe as the cornerstone of its stability (imperial injustices aside). This view arose from the former British colonies’ familiarity with British troops, British industry and trade, as well as British soft power (the royal family and BBC) and what it used to mean for them, for their past and future.However, the increasing dominance of the US moonlight’s beam in the 20th century meant, naturally, the sunset of the British hegemony. Since the Americans grabbed the world’s remote control, there has been a reset – with the world order drastically changed in the American direction. And the world has received the new American cultural reality with few apparent\u0026nbspconflictions, except one, the British legacy. British officials, institutions and soldiers may have left their ex-colonies, but their imprint has remained.Due to its intertwining impact on the future and welfare of people in the UK, Brexit has tended to be seen, from abroad, as a local mess with no immediate implication anywhere else. Is it true though? Are citizens in other parts of the world immune to the effects of Brexit’s shrapnel? In any event, do people elsewhere care about us? Certainly it might be reasonable to think that it’s important to know what they make of us and of our country.350m a week for the NHS became a defining symbol of the Brexit referendum campaign (Getty)Many people in Britain see their country in mayhem, but they don’t necessarily know what to do to get themselves out of Brexit\u0027s snare (not even the government appears to have an answer, nor most of those who voted for EU withdrawal). The confusion over the outcome of the referendum in 2016 – which is psychological at its core – has been so powerful that it has split society in two. Some are doomed to see Brexit as a Noah’s Ark others are ready to put a big hole in it below the water line.But if you think we in the UK are confused, it should be said that people around the world follow events without having any clue about what on earth is happening here. Wherever you go now, the question on everyone’s lips is along the lines of: why are the British muddling themselves into this most abhorrent and unjustified self-harm?Brexit casts a dark cloud over our experts’ predictions for 2019Do not get me wrong, people from all over the globe watch the BBC too. Many are still able to form some sort of opinion on the subject. Indeed, given the complexities involved, this has created a paradoxical reality where someone in Nicaragua can be as educated on Brexit as a Brexiteer from the midlands of England. It’s not the information that people lack, it’s their ability to absorb (and perhaps contextualise) it.For many beyond our shores, the right acronym for this dogged quandary which the UK has been juggling with for two and a half years is political “civil war”. This might be a bit over-amplified, but it is, indeed, some kind of a war waging, but in a civil manner.Yet the outcome of the British conflict over Brexit still might, as the UK did in the past, play a role in forming the world’s reality. Exiting the EU has set a different course for the post-Second World War\u0026nbsporder a course which could end up setting Europe ablaze.People on the other side of the English Channel have certainly grown very sceptical about British integrity when it comes to doing business of any kind. There is no point signing a deal with a nation that appears unable or unwilling to honour its word on previous European deals it has been part of. This is what Britain’s image abroad has become in some quarters.Take the Norwegians as another example. Once a “Norway-style” option became a possible alternative to Ms May’s Brexit agreement, Norwegian politicians panicked mainly because, after turning our back on the EU, they duly thought that Britain could get Norway’s ship scuttled too. Many in Europe just don’t trust Britain anymore. They increasingly think that the British gamble over leaving the EU could wreak havoc on their own present and future.But Europeans are not alone. Americans watch Brexit with horror too. Well, not all Americans, but especially those who did not vote for Donald Trump. Trump supporters see Brexit as a victory on the same historical scale as their waggish president’s inauguration. But on the other side of the US political scene, life is gloomier.In fact, Brexit didn’t promote ision and fear only in Britain it also helped to create two Americas. One understands that Britain had no need whatsoever to depart the EU in order to deepen its ties with the US, as those disingenuous leavers are still trying to argue. This America represents the liberal institutions, most branches of officialdom and those who see the benefits of globalisation.Nevertheless, Trump is still pushing Britain to crash out with no deal, claiming that an endorsement of Ms May’s Brexit deal would mean the UK losing out on a favourable bilateral trade agreement with the US. This is not an off-the-cuff claim: it is a real bid from the most powerful man on the planet to sabotage the UK’s “special” relationship with America by feeding his own nationalist agenda.An opinion poll by Emerson College, published at the end of last year, showed that 91 per cent\u0026nbspof Americans support the “special relationship”.However, it seems that Americans have lost their faith in Britain as a trade partner. While\u0026nbspa majority still support a bilateral free trade agreement with the UK after Brexit, the poll showed that many in the US don’t think that Britain is a trustworthy partner to do business with. Of the respondents, 48 per cent\u0026nbsprated China as the most important trading partner for the US (76 per cent\u0026nbsphad China in their top two), and 20 per cent\u0026nbspwent for Canada first. Only 6 per cent of respondents saw Britain as the top trade partner (behind Israel and Australia too).Does the relationship, under Trump, still sound “special”?The other America – Donald Trump’s America – does not spare any thought to what’s happening abroad: it simply wants to take back control, supports building a wall on its border to stop immigration, chants “America first”\u0026nbspand wants to ditch multilateral institutions, such as Nato and the EU. It rings a bell, right?However, the association of Brexit’s bad boys with Trump’s presidential campaign was not the ultimate eye-catcher in terms of foreign involvement in the UK’s decision to split from the EU. What was most notable was capturing Nigel Farage and Arron Banks, and other leavers, in the same bed with Russia.Indeed, the alleged efforts of Banks and Farage to foster contact with both Russian officials and Trump’s campaign have raised concerns among investigators in the UK and the US.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBrexit has so far proved to be a zero-sum game, and the only nation still in love with zero-sum games is Russia. There should be no doubt by now that Brexit will only play into Russia’s hands. The very notion of “apocalyptic Europe”\u0026nbsphas informed the national belief system of the poker-faced Russian president Vladimir Putin for years. Stumbling out of a humiliating defeat at the end of the Cold War, the ex-KGB officer always saw a united Europe as another Soviet Union, but on the other side of the game.Ostensibly, it looks like this assumption has a Russian government monopoly, but, as time passes, skies are becoming cloudier. Putin managed to manipulate the Russian people into his antagonised theory through fuelling acrimony towards the west. This has been always a key tactic, which has proved efficient in turning ordinary citizens – more or less compelled as they are to consume constant, malicious propaganda – to believe that Brexit can turn the wheel in Russia’s favour. It’s so obvious from every angle in the globe – except where Brexiteers sit, of course – that Russia can’t wait but to see us out (for its own ends).No wonder Moscow has been meddling in Brexit from day one. The US Senate published a report in January last year noting that UK campaign finance laws do not require disclosure of political donations if they are from “the beneficial owners of non-British companies that are incorporated in the EU and carry out business in the UK”. This opacity, the report suggested, “may have enabled Russian-related money to be directed with insufficient scrutiny to various UK political actors”.This came as experts from the University of California at Berkeley and Swansea University identified 150,000 Twitter accounts with Russian ties that had been spreading messages on Brexit, which is not even to mention the Russian-owned media outlets RT and Sputnik’s extensive and “systematically one-sided coverage” of the Brexit debate, as the Senate report put it.Russian fake news teams targeted Mueller to discredit Trump probeBut Russians don’t really like these “accusations”, and robustly defend their government’s theory no matter what (and its denial of involvement). “We all agree that the Russian government has nothing to do with Brexit, and didn’t intervene one bit. We are stunned by these accusations,”\u0026nbspElena Sobonina, a Moscow-based expert on Russia’s foreign policy, told me.“We are Europe’s closest neighbours, therefore stability of the continent is crucial for us. We can’t afford playing this game, but if you want to know who is really working on weakening the EU and Nato you have to look west, to the US”, she said. “Everyone in Russia believes so.”Russians can point to Trump as Europe’s biggest rival, they can also claim that they are the champions of the EU’s stability but in Putin’s eyes, Britain will always be a special enemy. \u0026nbspThe poisoning of the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal in March last year in Salisbury helped Putin’s close circle to make the case to ordinary Russians. While wacky politicians, like Boris Johnson, were turning the show into an outcry for their own self-indulgent political tactics, Putin was mobilising Russia’s citizens – through their natural sense of grievance since the collapse of the Soviet Union – against Britain and what it represents.Britain’s hard stance on Russia – that it was to blame for the attempted assassination and ought to be punished – sent a message to Balkan and former Soviet nations that they would not be on their own, that Britain would not abdicate its responsibilities towards this part of the world, where people still perceive Russia as a threat. A young Lithuanian told me: “Old people, who lived under the Soviet occupation, do not invest in a home or\u0026nbspland because they still think the Russians will, eventually, come over and take everything away.”However, the way in which Britain’s position was perceived in ex-Soviet spheres of influence also uncovered a huge sympathy towards Russia and Putin’s cause in countries seen as crucial for Britain after Brexit, like China.British politicians have rarely been able to understand China due to a major misconception about its intentions. Ironically, Britain – the liberal empire which used to dominate the world – is plagued by isolationism and xenophobia, while the ex-communist acropolis, China, is becoming ever more free market orientated, undertaking a systematic process to liberalise trade.What I learned about Brexit inside the school for the French eliteDuring his visit to Beijing last summer, the\u0026nbspchancellor Philip Hammond seemed to be presenting Britain’s letter of credence to the Chinese, as they become the champion of free trade. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd sure enough, despite seeing Brexit as an imminent threat to the world’s economic stability, Chinese leaders still see it as a potentially big opportunity. Chinese businessmen, especially, believe it is a good idea to take advantage of the British “national desperation” to sign free trade deals. This promise, which has always been at the core of Brexiteer’s arguments for leaving the EU campaign, created Britain’s vulnerability in the eyes of pushy China. Chinese president Xi Jinping will trade with Britain, but this time on his own terms.In truth though, while China and the US are locked in a trade war, Britain’s dreams in the east seem diminished for now. Post-Brexit Britain will increasingly become dependent on the US (probably on Trump’s terms), and as long as Trump is in the Oval Office, the likelihood of any trade deal with China is minimal.As for ordinary Chinese craftsmen and small business owners, who look to foreign markets to sell their goods, many wonder why their British equivalents would countenance running away from the EU, the biggest market in the world. Asked about Brexit and how people back home see it, a Chinese restaurateur in London’s Chinatown told me: “People don’t get it! They just sit there mocking the British and having a laugh at them.”The real laugh is that Brexiteers are trying to sell a globalised “new” Britain, while leaving the very European organisation that still holds the global liberal system together and that is at the heart of global trade.According to the same diplomat, “Arab leaders want Britain to stay in the EU because they know that Brexit will hit its role on the international stage really hard, and subsequently we, in the Arab world, would have a lot at stake”.For Gulf countries particularly, trade with Britain is indisputably important. But in a region where stability (such as it is) still relies heavily on the US and the UK, any radical change in these two countries’ roles on the global stage would reflect heavily on the area. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp“In the GCC, those who are traditionally bigger proponents of regional organisations see Brexit as a threat to regionalism tout-court, and see … the potential weakening of the EU as mirroring or anticipating the weakening of the GCC,”\u0026nbspsays\u0026nbspCinzia Bianco, a researcher on Gulf-European relations at the University of Exeter.“This is especially because the GCC, for a period during the early 2000s, looked at the EU as a potential model in certain aspects,”\u0026nbspshe adds.Those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the Mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideasMany in the Gulf believe the UK was never meant to be part of the EU, and saw the UK as something different. According to Ms Bianco: “This is mostly due to the historical background of the UK being a semi-colonial power in the Gulf: GCC countries, therefore, have traditionally dealt with London on a bilateral level, with strong defence, political and economic relations, and very rarely through the EU.”This might explain why the Arab media is pretty much obsessed with Brexit. All the big ones – Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, Sky News Arabia, Al Ghad – and even local news channels now follow Brexit more than Syria or Libya’s bloody civil wars.But when you participate in a Brexit debate on one of these channels, the pressing question they all ask is: “Do you think another referendum will take place?” It sounds like Arabs, for some reason, want Britain to stay in the EU more than British people themselves. This interest is reflected in the number of Independent readers from the Middle East who are keen to read about the subject. Brexit is our best-read topic in Egypt.Why might this be? Maybe it is a subconscious sympathy hammered out of an historical feeling of association (for good or ill) with Britain’s affairs. Maybe it is a genuine fear that if Great Britain exits the EU, it will not be great again and its role in the Middle East will be diminished.An Arab diplomat reflected ironically on the question when I put it to him: “Maybe our people are afraid of European immigration if Brexit would, at some point in the future, result in the collapse of the EU.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Most seem to be aware, despite the extensive coverage, of nothing more than the bare fact that Brexit means Britain would be walking away from the EU. But their favourite question remains: “But, why?” And that is a good question indeed.“The reason why Brexit hasn’t been on the ordinary Arabs’ top of the agenda is that it happened in conjunction with what is called ‘the Arab Spring’, including the Syrian, Yemeni, and Libyan civil conflicts,”\u0026nbspsays Mohamed Kawas, a prominent French-Lebanese journalist.“On governments’ level, those who represent the traditional regional order, just as the mullahs’ regime in Iran, Putin in Russia and Trump in the White House, don’t really like the idea of an international multilateral dynamic. In fact, in their perception of the EU, they enjoy more listening to the extreme right wing’s toxic ideas”, he adds.It should be clear by now that Brexit is not just a local British dilemma. It will not only change people’s lives here, but in some other parts of the world too – directly or indirectly. This is due to its strategic and economic impact on Europe’s stability, Britain’s position on the world’s stage, and how Brexit will help Russia to rise again as a superpower in a new bipolar order.It is notable too that whereas the English language has always been a big help in making local issues, especially in the UK and the US, explicable internationally, the complexities of Brexit (and its inane explanations) did the opposite. For many outsiders, debate about Brexit remains something their eyes can see but their minds can’t process.Still, it has been the UK’s global standing as a nation of good repute that has been hit most. Those who always looked up to this country and its democratic and liberal values are united with those who loathe its imperial history and disastrous foreign policy decisions, such as the invasion of Iraq. Both sides – allies and foes – are now sceptical about Britain’s integrity and honesty, and doubtful about the extent to which other nations can any longer follow Britain’s leadership.\u0026nbspOf course, the British people themselves still have to get their heads around Brexit before anyone else. But whatever the outcome, it will not change the new reality:\u0026nbspthe damage is done, and Britain is not great anymore.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But here we were lucky, and caught this one, and can now study it in more detail.”Even despite being called small by the scientists who found it, the world is still huge compared to us: it is about three times our size, and\u0026nbsp23 times as massive. That puts it in the category of a sub-Neptune, and means that it would be the first roughly Earth-sized planets to have been found by TESS.But it is unlikely to look much like our own planet. It\u0027s probably made of gas like Neptune or Uranus, though something far more dense than their atmospheres.“We think this planet wouldn’t be as gaseous as Neptune or Uranus, which are mostly hydrogen and really puffy,” Dragomir says. “The planet likely has a density of water, or a thick atmosphere.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Do people in this House have any idea how out-of-touch the general public think we are most days?We are talking about 79 days until potentially crashing out of Europe without a deal - should our focus not be on the detail and the arguments about the process in this place, but getting on with a plan B if Parliament decides the Government\u0027s plan is not the one for the people?When are we going to start acting like public servants doing the right thing and having the debate and getting on with it?Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, asks the speaker to publish the advice he received\u0026nbspon today\u0027s amendment - referring to reports he acted against advice provided by the clerks. Fair to say Bercow does not look impressed.\u0026nbspHe says of course he listens to the advice, and that advice is private.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJohn Bercow, the Commons speaker, says he is clear in his mind that he has taken the right course. I am trying to do the right thing and to do the right judgements, he says - in reference to Dominic Grieve\u0027s amendment.\u0026nbspHe is facing a degree of criticism from Conservative MPs for his decision to accept the amendment.Tory MP Mark Francois yelled ridiculous and that is utter sophistry, but\u0026nbspMr Bercow defended his decision.The answer is simple, he said. He referred to a motion and he said that no motion in this context, for the purposes of precis, may be moved other then by a Minister of the Crown. Tis so.We\u0027re not speaking here of a motion but of an amendment to a motion. I\u0027m sorry but there is a distinction between a motion and an amendment.What he says about a motion I accept but it doesn\u0027t relate to an amendment. That is the answer.But Kenneth Clarke, the former Tory chancellor and senior MP, defends the speaker for giving power to the House of Commons. He tells his colleagues getting overexcited to don a yellow jacket and go outside.\u0026nbsp@hereCorbyn says the PM has spent the last week\u0026nbspbegging the EU for changes, but nothing has been changed to the withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe asks - naturally - for a general election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut May hits back, pointing out confusion in Labour\u0027s Brexit policy.\u0026nbsp“His Brexit policies are the many not the few, she says.Corbyn says over £4bn is being wasted on no-deal planning - something the House expressed its will against on Tuesday evening in the first defeat for a government on a Finance Bill since 1978.\u0026nbspHe asks the PM to rule out no deal.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMs May says the government has negotiated a deal with the EU that protects jobs. She adds it is absolutely sensible for the government to plan for a no-deal scenario.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn says he agrees with the PM on intimidation against the media and MPs. He says May is bringing back exactly the same deal she delayed four weeks\u0027 ago, before the Christmas recess.\u0026nbspThe PM says the conclusions of the European council went further than before - and she says further clarification on the backstop is possible.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe says MPs\u0026nbspwill get a vote on whether to trigger backstop or extend the transition period if no new trade agreement is in place by 2020.Prime minister\u0027s questions has now started. Theresa May opens up the session by paying tribute to Paddy Ashdown - the former Lib Dem leader who died over the Christmas recess.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShe condemns\u0026nbspthreats of violence and intimidation against politicians and the media in recent days on College Green.\u0026nbspPoliticians and the media should be able to go about their work without harassment and intimidationSpeaker\u0027s office *finally* confirm Grieve amendment has been selected. It had already been confirmed by Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who tabled the motion.\u0026nbspIt means John Bercow will put the question to MPs in the Commons around 1pm - shortly after prime minister\u0027s questions.\u0026nbspDominic Grieve\u0027s amendment - requesting the prime minister to reveal her plan B earlier than previously expected - has been selected by the Commons speaker, John Bercow. Theoretically, this means MPs will vote on the motion later today.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBercow is expected to outline his reasoning shortly after prime minister\u0027s questions.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Extinction Rebellion demands that the UK government reduces to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and creates a citizens assembly to oversee changes in environmental policiesEngland batsman Jonny Bairstow celebrates after reaching his century during Day One of the Third Test match against Sri Lanka at Sinhalese Sports Club in ColomboPrime Minister Theresa May joins a parent and baby group during a visit to the Kentish Town Health Centre in LondonA crashed car, with an object protruding through the windscreen, sits abandoned on the A628 in the Peak District, as a blast of snow hit the north of EnglandWaves crash over Seaham lighthouse near Durham as the cold and wet weather continues“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But with the Brexit process having descended into chaos, the prospect of an extension to the period is now being talked about, including among ministers and UK officials.How can\u0026nbspArticle 50 be extended?An extension of Article 50 would require two things: firstly, the UK would have to ask for one. Secondly, the other 27 EU countries would have to unanimously agree to it.There is no formal limit on the deadline extension, though the EU has previously suggested that it would not grant an indefinite prolongation.How is this relevant to a second referendum?Brexiteer MP walks through pro-EU protest with GoPro to document abuseBrexit secretary ‘has not discussed’ delaying UK’s EU withdrawalFury as Brexit secretary suggests no new referendum due to protestsReferendums take quite a bit of time to organise – the Electoral Commission recommends that “referendum legislation should be clear at least six months before it is required to be implemented”, though it could probably in reality be done somewhat quicker than that.Either way, with the clock running down, a second referendum would effectively require an extension (or revocation) of Article 50.Nevertheless, the path to a second referendum depends on the politics of the issue and who supports one.\u0026nbspWould the EU grant an extension?The EU has mostly refused to discuss the hypothetical question of an extension. Some countries, including Ireland, have said they would not stand in the way, but that it is for the UK to ask for one. The UK government has said it does not want one and that its policy is to leave on 29 March.Behind the scenes, EU officials believe a short extension could be possible, but that it should not go beyond May, when the next European parliament elections are due to be called.The UK would, by law, have to participate in these elections unless it had departed the EU beforehand.Officials are wary of the idea of granting an extension for no reason, or just to buy the UK time, if\u0026nbspthere is\u0026nbspno prospect of further process – they believe there should be a reason behind it.Holding a referendum would probably\u0026nbspbe an acceptable reason, though it is impossible to know for sure\u0026nbspwhat will happen until the UK government actually asks the question.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

latest","story":"But just what does a no deal Brexit mean for the UK  Heres what we know so far.A no-deal British departure from the European Union means leaving without formal arrangements for the future relationship.Currently Britains trade, customs and immigration rules are tied up with the single market and a host of EU regulatory bodies.Ministers are seeking a legal deal to replace these with looser arrangements so we are outside the single market and customs union but keeping close ties so cross-border trade is easy.Negotiations are ongoing under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ahead of the UKs exit on March , .Some fear these talks could collapse without a deal agreed before the deadline.This could mean the UK being treated as a third country by the EU with commerce governed by World Trade Organisationrules.Its reported DUP leader Arlene Foster believes the UK is set to leave the EU without a deal at all.Leaked emails say the Northern Irish leader was left furious after hostile and dficult meetings with the EU boss Michel Barnier.She is poised for talks to collapse totally between Britain and the EU, which would mean we would leave with no deal at all, the Observer reported.On January , Boris Johnson claimed that a No Deal Brexit is the closest to what people voted for in the referendum.He also urged Cabinet Ministers to mirror the British publics optimism and self-confidence for the possible exit scenario.Mrs May is fighting back against opponents of her blueprint for Brexit, saying Parliament will have to choose between her proposal and crashing out of the European Union without a deal.It would mean scrapping a -month transition period lasting until the end of , and the exit would be immediate.Brexiteers say it would be a boost for the UK to be free from Brussels rules and we will be able to strike deals with other upcoming nations around the globe.We would also not be obliged to pay the £billion orce bill, according to a House of Commons report — but Chancellor Philip Hammond sparked fury by saying we would pay up even without a deal.Many people fear the UK economy would be hurt by a clf edge Brexit as trade is held up by new border checks and tarfs and more red tape for businesses.Doom-monger Bank of England governor Mark Carney has warned house prices could crash by a third in a worst-case scenario.Customs checks on cross-Channel freight could cause havoc at ports, hitting food supplies and other goods such a motor parts.In a pure no-deal scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each inidual country.A no deal would also see residency rights for EU nationals in the UK potentially disappear overnight.In theory, these people would become third country nationals, meaning they would be subject to domestic immigration rules.There is also uncertainty over what would happen at the  mile border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The EUs rules may require Ireland to impose customs and other checks to protect the bloc’s border – which some say would mark ato the dark days of the Troubles.It could blow a hole in the Good Friday Agreement, with pressure on all sides to find a compromise.Theresa May announced on January  that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday, January May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit backstop is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.The promise came as the Government released details of new measures for Northern Ireland designed to win over critics of the backstop, in a last-ditch bid to win support for her Withdrawal Agreement in a crucial vote next Tuesday.Speaking at Prime Ministers Questions ahead of the opening of a five-day debate on her plans, Mrs May insisted that the agreement was a good deal and urged MPs to support it.Ministers announced plans for troops on the street and emergency ferries to cope with a No Deal Brexit.They will order businesses and families to start preparing for Britain to leave the EU without a deal and release £billion of extra spending.Businesses receive a -page document on Friday, with a total of , firms likely to hear from the Government over the next few days.The news comes as:Theresa May’s Government plunged into utter disarray over Brexit just  hours before a crunch Cabinet meeting over Britain’s future.Aides of Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed he would call on colleagues on Tuesday to dramatically accelerate No Deal planning given the deadlock over the PM’s Brexit deal.The Sun can reveal he ‘activated’ the NHS’ own plans last week – amid spiralling fears key medicines could be caught up in chaos at the border.One ally said: “He doesn’t want no deal but thinks it’s essential that we prepare for it as a possible outcome.”It came as Justice Secretary David Gauke threatened to resignthe PM puts Britain on a course to leave the EU without a deal.He said: “I couldn’t support a conscious decision to crash out at the end of March and I don’t think there are many who could.”But Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted Britain could “flourish and prosper”it walks away from the EU with No Deal.He separately said he’d love a “crack” at being the next Prime Minister.Meanwhile, allies of International Aid Secretary Penny Mordaunt revealed she would back the idea of a ‘managed’ No Deal at a key speech today.And Trade Secretary Liam Fox became the first Brexit-backing Cabinet Minister to say it may be an idea to allow the Commons an ‘indicative vote’ on alternative Brexit plans such as Norway Plus or a second referendum.As bitter Brexit battles rage

once.I get it. There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thanks to this Prime Minister, we haven’t a clue how  will start, let alone finish.Chaos is the only certainty as the Government faces parliamentary defeat over her Chequers botch.We might then be in for a grinding marathon of rematches, a crisis General Election, a second referendum or — the only really positive option — joining hands with the rest of the world.Thanks to Brexit saboteur Phil Hammond, the path to those open seas is blocked by tank traps, landmines and treasury barbed wire.Hammond, aided by EU fth columnist Olly Robbins, is the panic merchant behind Project Fear Mark .Unless we accept Brexit In Name Only , abide by EU rules on trade and customs and bow to the European Court of Justice, we will starve to deathwe are not first eaten alive by rats. These are only “worst case” scenarios, you understand.More likely, we would prosper and flourish without a deal and, after a brief period of turbulence, wonder what this bitterness and recrimination was all about.Hammond, who loathes Mrs May and would have been sacked in a flash had she won her catastrophic  election, is now lead blues singer with The Remoaners.When the history of this bungled mess is written, he will emerge as principal villain, the Scrooge Chancellor who blocked every attempt to win a real deal from Brussels.He has waited until too late to unleash a few quid to build ferry and port infrastructure.His motive, shared by the hostage PM, is to drive home the fraudulent nightmares of No Deal at the expense of the national interest.Olly Robbins, a fan of Stalin’s Soviet Union, is the so-called Brexit negotiator who failed at any point in the last two miserable years to wring a single unwilling concession out of Brussels.History’s verdict will be harsher stillwe now end up bogged down indefinitely with BRINO, locked into EU coils without any of the benefits of actually getting out.Brussels doesn’t want us to leave — and they will make damned sure we don’t.The catalyst will be the day Mrs May actually signs off £BILLION to keep the leaky EU afloat while Britain remains shackled to a sinking ship.So far, this vast sum is merely a digital symbol with no immediate impact on the hard-pressed taxpayers who must pay.But once this cheque is cashed, reality will dawn with unpredictable consequences.For there is no magic £billion sitting in Treasury vaults. We would have to borrow it to bail out the EU — while struggling to pay our own bills here at home.Britain has little appetite for social unrest. For the moment, we can look across the Channel with bemused detachment as Paris is engulfed in flames.But .million people here voted for Brexit. They knew what they were doing.The same is not quite true of those who voted to stay.Many were reluctant Remainers. Some would have voted for Brexit, but for George Osborne’s original Shock and Horror. They know better now.They have seen ministers crying “wolf” too often.They don’t believe Theresa May, Hammond, the Treasury or discredited George “Six Jobs” Osborne.No Deal terries Brussels but it doesn’t scare waverers any more.Along with Tory MPs ing fortied by local supporters after the Christmas break, most are braced and ready for leaving the EU on global trade terms.Mrs May is banking everything on a last-ditch deal with Brussels over the Northern Ireland scam.Without it, she — or someone  — must tear up the cheque, hoist the sails and steer Britain out of the EU and into clear blue water.ENERGETIC Health Secretary Matt Hancock wants to make the patchy NHS world class.Here’s one good reason why he must.A friend with a skin blemish was booked for a biopsy in Chelmsford, Essex, last March.Months rolled by.So she paid out of her savings for a biopsy and then surgery after a specialist confirmed cancer and warned delay might have serious consequences.This weekend, NINE months later, she received a letter of apology and an update on her place in the queue for the biopsy.How many patients die before they get a letter like that Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The trial will start in July this year.After the trial is over, Ms Rudd will look at how it worked and consider best how to put everyone onto the new new flagship welfare policy.MPs need to vote to approve both the trial, and also on how to put the million others onto the new system.That meansyoure currently on benefits youre unlikely to move over to the new system this year.But Theresa May has said the programme is still on track to be done by  - with everyone on it.The news comes just after The Sun launched its Make Universal Credit Work campaign, demanding ministers make more changes to the flagship policy now before its too late.Weve told countless stories of how Brits are being pushed into debt waiting for their first payment, and have been forced to food banks and to payday loans.Ms Rudd revealed also revealed that the number of people who will be on Universal Credit will DOUBLE by the end of the year - as people naturally move over.This means thatyou have a change of circumstance - likeyou move home, your partner moves in with you, or you lose your job and have to make a new claim for benefits, then you will go onto Universal Credit.Ministers expect there to be another .million people who go onto Universal Credit in that way this year.And they wont be able to get any help with payments when they change over either, leaving many hundreds of pounds worse off.No, its just the process for people already on benefits which is being considered at the moment.Universal Credit rolls six benefits into one monthly payment, but the rollout has been beset with issues.Its now in every jobcentre in the country and is unlikely to be ditched altogether.MPs are worried about thousands of vulnerable and disabled Brits who could slip through the net and lose their benefits in the transfer.Others are urging the Government to transfer them over automatically, rather than make them sign up all over again.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told the Commons, said: I will want to consider carefully when I bring to the House the vote for the three million managed migration, which is scheduled for . Im still considering when to do that.She added: The , pilot as always, which was announced some time ago, informs us how we do that.Yes. In the last Budget Philip Hammond promised to increase the work allowances for people on Universal Credit by £, - allowing millions to earn £ extra every year from April this year.He also revealed:Theres lots of help out there for people who are already on Universal Credit and wont be seeing any changes anytime soon.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no other site to fit this description.“In Byzantine times, the historian Eusebius said that Kirjathjearim was nine or  miles west of Jerusalem, which this site is.“Also the name of the hill in Arabic – Deir el-Azar – preserves the name of the Byzantine monastery: the Monastery of Elazar.“According to the Book of Samuel, Elazar was the priest in charge of the Ark.”Along with his colleagues, Thomas Romer and Christophe Nicoll of the College de France, Professor Finkelstein has been digging at Kiryat Yearim since August  as part of the Shmunis Family Excavation.And though he has found no evidence of the Ark itself, he believes he can shed some light on its true nature.Kirjathjearim straddled the border of two ancient kingdoms – Israel to the north and Judah to the south – with excavations suggesting the site was used by the former to control the latter.Against this backdrop, Professor Finkelstein believes the Ark story was invented to give Kirjathjearim religious legitimacy as an administrative centre.It also emphasises a fabled past when the two kingdoms were united under a single ruler, further legitimising ancient Israels rule over its southern neighbour.Prof Finkelstein said: “We are not searching for the Ark. We are trying to understand the Ark Narrative: who composed it, when and why.“The biblical narrative probably comes from the Northern Kingdomand was seemingly composed in the first half of the th century BC.It probably served the ideological goals of the kingdom at the time, perhaps also its territorial aspirations, namely control over Judah.Lending weight to this theory is a huge  discovered at the site.He explained: Kirjathjearim was a typical hill country town, on a peak, with relatively steep slopes.But on the summit there was an elevated , which was probably the location of a temple.He believes Judah was too weak to have constructed the  itself and thinks the likeliest builder was the occupying Northern Kingdom.If he’s right, it would prove the kingdom’s influence over the site.The Arks whereabouts have long been the subject of speculation, with some saying it may have been melted down for gold, hidden on Mount Nebo, Jordan, or even taken to Africa.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Right ahead.”Then we all sat and waited for the impact that would surely follow.And waited . . . and waited, as Gemma remained stubbornly upright for the duration.Such is le at Dancing On Ice, “the show where anything could happen”, according to the continuity announcer, but never actually does.That’s the main reason why people stopped watching and ITV buried it in a cold and shallow grave five years ago.Then, without much warning or any great demand, it was suddenly brought back to le, last year, and proved every bit as underwhelming and injury free as I remembered.There’s no horse too dead for another ITV flogging, though, so it’s just ed for yet another run, with most of the same fixtures and fittings.Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby do a solid enough job of hosting, considering their script could suck a black hole inside out, and there’s a four- man Ice Panel where the truth bombs are exclusively supplied by Jason Gardiner, who arrived dressed as Bret Maverick for Sunday’s opening show.What seems to separate this year’s Dancing On Ice from almost every other series, however, is the line-up. It’s actually quite imaginative and offers the show a serious chance of redemption,just one of them can be hospitalised before the end of the run.Among the  contenders, we’ve got: Westle’s Brian McFadden, Richard “Hollywood is the catalyst for everything I do” Blackwood, cricketer Ryan Sidebottom, and Saira Khan, who was advised by Ruth Langsford to “do Strictly”, but is a bit too low rent for the BBC so is stuck here wearing skates and tights.Despite having two hours to fill, none of that lot actually got to dance on Sun- day, though, as, I suspect, ITV wanted to clear the decks for its preferred bookings.These include -year-old Didi Conn , from Grease, Corrie’s Jane Danson, who was put in “a horse lt, with half rotation”, and Mark “Joe Mangel” Little, who’s turned into Dog The Bounty Hunter since we last saw him on Neighbours.But let’s not kid ourselves here. The reason many of us probably tuned in, on Sunday, in was to see Gemma Collins.Towie’s self-styled “GC” the first letter of which stands for Gigantic. A woman who really could do with a heavy landing on that over-entitled a**e of hers or, better still, developing a work ethic and some humility.I prayed for the worst then, and saved what was left for her partner, Matt Evers, but he’d clearly taken one look at Gemma and thought “screw that for le without a disability allowance”.There were no lts, no falls and she didn’t even have the decency to rip her drawers when she tried the splits. Sunday was just another entry in DOI’s endless list of crushing disappointments.Partly thanks to some very sympathetic marking, from everyone except Jason, Gemma will also get to skate again in a fortnight, which, I think I’m right in saying, means they’ll have to make an attempt at the infamous “King Kong lt”.And then, once Addison Lee has dropped her off at the rink, it’s on with the skating.Piers Morgan: “I bumped into Gemma Collins in Langan’s restaurant, at Christmas, and . . . ”A “She’s OK, actually.”B “A Japanese sports network bought the footage for million yen.”THE expression TV gold doesn’t begin to do justice to BBC’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about Matt and Luke Goss’s O reunion gig.It’s a genuine masterpiece that would deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Spinal Tap,the pair of them weren’t so wonderfully serious about everything.Bros: After The Screaming Stops is the title of the film, directed by David Soutar and Joe Pearlman, who had the good sense just to point their cameras at the boys and let them say things like: “I made a conscious decision, because of Stevie Wonder, not to be superstitious.” “Rome wasn’t built in a day, f*** me that’s true, but we don’t have the time Rome did.” “He was a rectangle, I was a rectangle and together we made a square, which is a fortress.” And “There were  one-way streets and one solitary two-way street, where me and my brother met in the middle.” .As well as all the tortured metaphors and Matt’s profundities, though, the film also features a fantastically earnest rant about conkers and an escalating feud between the boys, which should have had every single viewer crying out for both of them to be included in the next I’m A Celebrity line-up, pretty much from the word go.But how did I feel at the end of this emotional dual carriageway In the words of poet philosopher singer Matt Goss: “Two words. Privileged.”John Humphrys: “At least  of the  books of the New Testament are usually attributed to which author ”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “New Year’s Day in the UK, January or December ”Lauren: “December.”And Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In , Mark Calaway, who’s better known as The Undertaker, retired from which sport ”Gerry: “Golf.”The Voice UK fooling me into thinking it might go a whole episode without Jenner Hudson “spontaneously” bursting into song.Luther turning out to be a soulless, unpleasant, far-fetched mess. The insane pouting contortions of Candice “Bake Off” Brown during Celebrity Mastermind.The BBC somehow crowbarring an anti-Brexit dig into The Greatest Dancer.And Dee Dee Wilde calling her old Tena Lady troop, on the same show, Pan’s Fans, rather than the far more appropriate and eye-catching Pads People. Basic stuff, really.Steve Howey: “You need to have experienced that experience to have the experience.”And Phil Thompson: “All these City players are like for like. Even Danilo, who isn’t as good as Kyle Walker.”JUST when they thought we couldn’t send them anything worse than the potato famine, up pipes Last Leg Of The Year guest Sue Perkins with this Brexit bonus: “My New Year’s resolution is to try and track down a dim and distant Irish relative, so I can finally get that passport.”Andthere are any genealogists who can help, send the information to me marked “Generation Game: Urgent.”Knighthood’s in the post.Paul Ryan’s Farage cameo on Brexit: The Uncivil War.Clarkson not trying to be likeable, on Millionaire, which, ironically, made him very likeable.Bradley Walsh hating every second of his skye on ITV’s Breaking Dad.Simplicity Cremations’ perfectly-placed advert during The Last Leg Of The Year .And Billy Connolly, overwhelmed by love, on BBC, paying tribute to: “All the things that made me good and bad, Scotland.”Match Of The Day’s Jonathan Pearce on Alo Morata: “He needs to do that game in, game out to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”“They need to do that gay men, gay marriage to prove he’s good enough for Cha.”Sent in by Iain Milne, Newcastle. Picture research: Amy Reading.TV dramatists haven’t yet rewritten the result of Brexit.But, trust me, they will eventually. This is just the start of the softening-up process.Brexit: The Uncivil War, a Channel  production that toyed with neutrality, for about  minutes, but had given up any pretence long before the drama’s rather desperate postscript finally stopped trying to nudge viewers in the Remainer direction.The two main characters weren’t entirely subtle either.One, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, was Dominic Cummings, the hi-vis dork who was in charge of the Leave campaign.The other, “I’M IN” leader Craig Oliver, whose portrayal, by Rory Kinnear, as a brilliant-but-tragic hero, was rather undermined by the fact Craig Oliver was also one of the drama’s political advisers.What saved The Uncivil War, though, was the acting, particularly Paul Ryan’s Nigel Farage turn, and Cumberbatch, who wasn’t a perfect fit for Cummings as his Durham accent slipped too often.It’s a performance brimming with such mesmerising charisma, though, I can genuinely see The Uncivil War effecting genuine change – two extra zeroes on Dominic Cummings’ next salary.Such is the real power of TV drama.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jean-Marc Puissesseau savaged the Transport Secretary for spending poundmillion on ferries to prepare for no deal Brexit - including on a firm that doesnt yet own any ferries. Seaborne Freight was handed a contract worth almost poundmillion to set up a route from Ramsgate, Kent, to Ostend in Belgium to boost capacitythere is no deal. Meanwhile the M motorway and disused Manston airfield are being lined up as lorry parksextra checks spark delays at the Port of Dover. But despite previously warning of -mile tailbacks, port President Mr Puissesseau claimed his port was perfectly able to handle the freight and implied the no deal spending was insulting.  We have been preparing for no deal for one year in Calais and on  March we will be ready, he claimed. And he angrily hit out at the government for allegedly trying to take business from his port by setting up a new service to Ostend in Belgium. He told the BBC Calais will not impose extra delays, other than the migrant checks running now. His officials will only ask for customs declarations, he claimed. We will not stop and ask more than we are doing today, he told BBC Radio s Today. I am very shocked.  I consider it disrespectful to Calais and to Dover what has been decided by the Mr Grayling of the British government. Mr Puissesseau made his bold claim of no delays despite research for the government warning it would take just  seconds of checks per truck to cause six-day tailbacks in Kent. He said the money was helping three ferry companies, among them one company which has no ferry, which is not working today, helping from Ostend to Ramsgate. It is a complete shock for us.  He claimed the only positive point is the migrants will leave Calais I hope to go to Oostend. The row illustrates the delicate negotiations over Brexit between the UK, EU and private firms. The UK government has insisted it is sensible to prepare for every eventuality, including ferry capacity. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “This signicant extra capacity is a small but important element of the Department for Transport’s no-deal Brexit planning. “While remaining committed to working to ensure a deal is reached successfully, the Department is helping ensure the rest of Government are fully prepared for a range of scenarios, including a particular focus on a potential no deal and to mitigate the impact of any Brexit outcome on all transport modes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit labour announce plan immediate","story":"NewsBrexit: Labour figures declare plan for immediate no confidence vote in the governmentTwo Shadow Cabinet ministers said therell be \"immediate\" actionTheresa Mays deal is defeated - suggesting we could be facing a general election campaign in just three weeks timeShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsSo far Labour, including figures around Jeremy Corbyn, have refused to say exactly when they would table a formal no confidence vote in the government \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLabour will launch an immediate no confidence vote in the governmentTheresa Mays Brexit deal is defeated next week, two shadow cabinet ministers have suggested.

The only way you can secure a general election is to table a motion of confidence in the government.  Mr Gwynne saidMrs Mays deal does not pass it is a spectacular failure for the government. We want a general election. And the only way you can get a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act is to table a vote of confidence, he said. He reiterated: In the event of Theresa May failing to get her deal through, we will be calling for a general election. And to do that, you have to table a motion of confidence. Askedit was a guarantee, Mr Gwynne replied: Absolutely. Responding to both politicians comments, a Labour spokeswoman insisted the partys policy was still to judge the timing day by day. She said: If the government is defeated next week, it will clearly have lost the confidence of parliament and there should be a general election.We have always said that it’s a matter of when, notwe table a motion of no confidence and we’ll judge the timing day by day.   Labour failed in a bid to have a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister before Christmas. But that vote was only in Theresa May personally - not Her Majestys Government. If Labour lays a full no confidence vote, it will have to be debated the next day. If the government loses, and no one  can command a Commons majority, a general election is triggered automatically after  days. But there is a big flaw in proposing a no confidence vote. The Tories  DUP allies have said they will only back Labour against the governmentthe Brexit deal PASSES, notit fails. It came as Theresa Mays Brexit deal looked doomed to defeat next Tuesday after her DUP allies REJECTED a compromise - before she even published it.  Mrs Mays deputy David Lidington said the government would unveil specic proposals to calm fears in Northern Ireland about her -page Brexit deal. But minutes later and before he even published the plan the DUP rejected those compromises in a dramatic TV interview. The row is over a backstop that could trap the UK under EU customs rules, and force checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,there is no agreement to safeguard the Irish border by December . EU chiefs have agreed to provide extra assurances but not remove the backstop.  Yet DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told Sky News: The only deal that could swing the DUP round isthe backstop as it applies to the UK as a whole or to Northern Ireland specically were removed from this agreement. He added: Constitutionally and economicallythis deal went through it would be ruinous and indeed would do what th IRA failed to do over  years of a terrorist campaign. Meanwhile today, Tory rebel Dominic Grieve tabled an amendment that would give MPs a greater say over what happens nextthe deal is voted down. It would require a motion to be put to the Commons by Monday  January, not mid-February.

I was very disappointed that the use of a quote out of context was timed with the release of the live album and it seemed asthe focus went onto the quote rather than the work. It was deeply frustrating. At the time I discussed the idea of responding to it with close friends and we all agreed it was best to let it go. It seems the quote keeps being used and so I’d like to present my side of the story.  Over the years, I have avoided making political comments in interviews. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power. I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hilary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time - because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM, who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down.

He told the BBC that sad cowards with nothing better to do had issued the threat after he joined forces with Labour to inflict another humiliating defeat on the PM last night. He vowed not to be bowed by the attacks. Mr Boles, who voted Remain in the referendum, has been pushing for the UK to have a similar relationship to Norway with the EU. Its latest iteration - called Norway plus - would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market and the customs union.  On Tuesday night the Lincolnshire MP became one of  Tories to vote for an amendment to block taxation powers unless no-deal is taken off the table. They dealt a blow to the government after the amendment passed by  votes to .Labour former minister Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment to the Budget-enactingFinance Bill which attracted support from Tory rebels.Her proposal aims to restrict the Governments freedom to use the Bill to make tax changes linked to a no-deal Brexit without the explicit consent of Parliament. In his speech Mr Boles said Theresa May had secured a deal that Tory MPs could support.   He said: We do not have a bad deal we may have a deal that you, inidually, do not like, but nobody can claim that we do not have a deal that it is reasonable for Conservative members to support. It is therefore reasonable for us to say that, at this late stage, with the government having prepared as woefully as they have for no deal, we will on no account countenance a no-deal Brexit. He concluded: I will vote on any motion, on any amendment, on any piece of legislation, proposed by whomsoever in this House to ensure that we leave the European Union on  March with a deal or not at all. But Downing Street has downplayed the signicance of these limits. Mr Boles is one of the latest in a long line of MPs to receive abuse because of their stance on Brexit. On Monday footage of Tory Remainer Anna Soubry being called a Nazi by far right protesters caused outrage throughout Westminster. A clip which showed the MP for Broxtowe being followed and shouted at prompted a number of MPs to write to the Met Police Commissioner to ask officers to step in. It followed a day of yellow vest protesters following MPs and journalists around Westminster, some of whom yelled abuse.

Notices warning belongings will be seized have been erected in a Tube subway, a few feet from where two rough sleepers were found dead or dying in the last year. The signs say: These walkways are cleaned on a daily basis. Private property must not be left unattended within the walkways. Any property or possessions that appear to be left unattended for any period of time and for whatever reason may be removed without any further notice and may be disposed of as litter or waste. They have been placed directly opposite chalk tributes that still adorn the wall to Gyula Remes, a kitchen worker who was found dying in the subway last month.  Westminster Council claimed the signs were not directed at anyone specically. But Labours Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: These signs smack of the Council trying to push homelessness problems out of sight, out of mind. In cold winter weather, blankets and sleeping bags may be people’s leline not ‘litter’ or ‘waste’. But ultimately rising homelessness is a national problem which needs national action from Government.  Usually there are up to half a dozen people sleeping rough in the affected portion of the subway early in the morning, but today there were none. Metal crowd control barriers have also been put up in the subway, which leads directly to the door MPs and staff use to access the Houses of Parliament. In a separate action, part of the subway has also been closed off for building work.  House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom - who does not have responsibility for the subway - is in talks with Commons authorities to try and address the issue. She said: Homelessness and iniduals sleeping rough in and around Westminster station continues to be a sad and serious issue and one which I am keen to see addressed. I am in discussions with the Director General and will be looking to see what more can be done to ensure the safety and security of those sleeping rough near the estate - and how we can help them off the streets and into accommodation. A Westminster City Council spokesperson said: These signs are not directed at anyone specically, but a reminder from the Council and politan Police that given this is a busy public area, any items left unattended will be cleared in the interest of safety and security - especially given the proximity to Parliament and Whitehall. We take the security of our public places very seriously, working closely with the police to keep Londoners and visitors safe.

Flights were also disrupted at Heathrow on Tuesday, after multiple sightings of drones near the runway. Government ministers are hoping to give civilian authorities the power to defend themselves - and the public - from unlawful and malicious drone activity, providing them with military-style defences such as electronic jammers and net guns. The new laws will also see drones and other remote controlled aircrafts completely banned in a three mile radius from all airports - an improvement on the current ban of two-thirds of a mile, according to The Times.  Maximum flight heights for drones currently stand at ft, and that number is set to be lowered by the new legislation set to be drafted in May. Ministers are hoping to one-up hostile drone operators by employing state-of-the-art high-tech safety devices before they hit the market. Such technology could include geo-fences, which would see drones programmed to avoid no-fly zones with the use of GPS co-ordinates or ground transmitters. However, for such measures to be effective, reform of police search powers will also need to take place so officers can ensure any devices comply with new laws.   They may also need to be permitted to bring drones down quickly with shotguns, hunting drones and missiles in circumstances posing threats of disruption or risk to le. Last Week reports revealed that Heathrow and Gatwick are set to spend millions investing in anti-drone technology, including the likes of the ‘Drone Dome’, which can jam communications between the drone pilot and the vessel. The drone threat came of age when they were used in Mosul to deliver bombs. But Gatwick highlighted a dferent threat, which is to create chaos rather than deliver ordnance,” said an official. It is an international problem but we want to become world leaders in solving it. The culprits behind the Gatwick disruption have yet to be identied, after more than , flights were erted, grounded an cancelled during the busy holiday period last month. Police say they have a large list of suspects but admit no arrests are imminent.

Alex Shade believes son Shane is being “slowly squeezed out of his education” because of his disruptive behaviour. And despite admitting Shane has been a “little bugger” and the class clown, he thinks teachers should be doing more to combat the incidents rather than sending him home. Alex, who is considering sending Shane somewhere , told Hull Live: “If Shane is pulling silly faces, making little noises and doing silly things like that, then why can’t the teachers deal with it  The -year-old said Kingswood Academy in Hull initially reduced the Year  pupils time in classes to two hours a day as a result of the behaviour. However, he was then told it would be just one hour a day after Shane turned up with “stars and stripes” in his hair. Alex, who runs a tattoo parlour, explained: They gave him two hours a day in school from about .am to .pm.It’s just two lessons a day but after he went to school with a new haircut I got a call from Shane saying it was now only an hour a day. “He never ends up having a full day in class and he is clearly losing out. It’s not right and they are not listening. “He plays up in class and the school can’t seem to deal with it. Alex, who gives Shane a spare key so that he can let himself in to his home, added: “It’s stupid and I just don’t get it. I’ve spoken to them and had a go at them because I get phone calls from teachers saying he has pulled faces behind teachers’ backs or that he has tapped on his desk and this all goes against him.  The frustrated dad says his son was a “bad lad” at primary school and “lashed out” due to dficulties at home. He began to turn a corner towards the end of his time at his previous school but reverted to being the “class clown” again just weeks after enrolling at Kingswood Academy. Alex said: “I’m constantly talking to him about his behaviour but there is only so much I can do.When the school is giving him just an hour a day it’s not helping me because he is basically getting away with it. “They need more authority to combat this. They are the teachers, they know the children and they should know how to deal with them.” Concerned by his son’s behaviour, Alex said he suggested to the school Shane be tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD. However, he was told in order to do that he would have to undergo a parental course which he was reluctant to do. He is also worried about Shanes job prospects.He said: “I wouldn’t be a parentI don’t worry about his academic future and it’s not looking good for him but I can’t home-school him because I’m no good at maths or English. “It needs sorting and the school needs to look at their policy properly and think about the kids instead of the paperwork.” A Kingswood Academy spokesman said: We at the academy have the highest of expectations regarding unorm - including hairstyles - which have been in place for the last  years. “These expectations are made very clear in the unorm policy which is shared with parents and students annually, and is also displayed on the academy website.Any student who fails to meet the standard initially has an opportunity to recty the issue,not they are placed in isolation. “At Kingswood, we have high expectations in terms of behaviour and we ensure that all students are provided with the most appropriate provision that meets their needs. “In February , Kingswood Academy was judged to be Good in all categories. Ofsted commented specically that the behaviour of pupils is good and that pupils appreciate the genuine care and support offered by teachers and other staff. “Ofsted also noted that pupils make good or better progress in a wide range of subjects and commented on how proud students were of their school and their unorm, which they wear with pride.” "},{"url":null,"title":"devastated mum shares photo newborn","story":"NewsDevastated mum shares photo of her newborn baby who died while his twin survivedWARNING UPSETTING IMAGES: Natalie Ives, from Kent, will bury baby Connor on Friday and are hoping to raise money for a plot and headstoneShareCommentsByAndy Robinson:,  JAN NewsMedway Maritime Hospital, Gillingham, Kent where Conor died \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA devastated mum has shared a photo of her newborn baby who died suddenly.

The former Truro city councillor still went on holiday to Butlins soon after the win, Cornwall Live reports. His first decision was to do something for the Merlin MS Centre in Cornwall as his late we Rosemary suffered from the condition for  years. He asked the charity what they wanted and the answer was a hot tub the largest hot tub in the country – a high tech anti-gravity pound million hydrotherapy pool for those suffering from MS, strokes, Parkinson’s and ME.   And Peters familys lives have all changed forever.All three of his children – Helen, Sharon and Anthony – now have new mortgage-free houses and brand new cars.His  grandchildren have or will have the same too - as will his three great-grandchildren and the one thats on the way. The lucky -year-old, who still does the lottery every week, said: “I used to go into shops and think it would be nice to have this and that, but now I can have what I want.” That includes a BMW i, an electric BMW i, Porsche Cayman in its own unique colour, a Bentley, and the last three Land Rover Defenders made .   Other purchases have included a pound, watch from Michael Spiers jewellers in Truro, a helicopter trip to the Cheltenham Gold Cup and two static caravans kept at his beloved Butlins in Minehead. But he ensures he keeps himself grounded, saying “I still own the house on Trelanderand would go back in a shot – I loved living there.” It was May , , when Peter Congdon checked his Wednesday Lotto ticket on Teletext as usual.“I’ve got pound,” he thought. “Oh no, it’s not...” Shocked, he walked to his daughter’s house ten doors down from him who double-checked the ticket - and it was certainly a lot more than pound. Peter had won just over pound. million.   The multi-millionaire said: “I couldn’t believe it then and I still can’t really believe it now.” The pool hes funding for the Merlin MS Centre will open in February.It will prove a leline for many and Peter’s kindness has even brought some sufferers to tears, with one man looking forward for his first dip in water for  years. The building will be painted primrose with the flowers planted outside as they were Rosemary’s favourite. Peter and his family have raised thousands for Merlin over the years on top of his poundm donation.   This includes donating a brand new Land Rover as a raffle prize, holding bingo competitions and taking part in a parachute jump. But Peter still gets emails and letters from strangers begging for money three years after his win. Daughter Helen Venton said: “We had funny letters from the beginning – including one man who wanted a coffin for his own funeral. We received the first letter on the actual night of the win – a woman wanted help paying off her husband’s gambling debts.” They have also had requests from strangers askingPeter will pay for weddings. One came all the way from Australia, addressed to Peter Congdon, Lottery Winner, Truro, Cornwall.  But Helen said: “We’ve been on the other end, trying to find money for prom dresses, for example.” That’s why Peter now loans out his flashy cars for school proms, only asking for a donation to the MS Centre in exchange.It’s all about “little gestures”, he says.Those gestures include paying for Tregolls School’s fireworks display for the past three years and funding campaign leaflets for Melissa Mead, the Penryn mum who recently received the MBE for her work raising awareness of sepsis. How much is left of Peter’s cash then  “I’ve got enough for this week,” he said.  He’s made investments and put some of the money in property, owning three houses at Trelander and three at Hendra in Truro. The family say they also fall victim of rumour and gossip. One of Peter’s relatives was shopping for nappies in Tesco when she heard a woman saying: “You’d think she’d find somewhere better to shop.” Peter said: Camelot were great, offering us a financial adviser and which banks we should use. They also respond to the begging letterswe forward them.   Although his home is a lot bigger than his previous abode, Peters house is still a modest affair.The giant cheque with the full amount of pound,, sits next to photos of the announcement at The Alverton hotel as well as the winning balls in lottery champagne glasses. The pensioner said: I told my children, Im thinking of having a tattoo. Dont be silly, they told me. But hed already had it done and revealed his lucky numbers tattooed over his heart alongside a rose in memory of his late we Rosemary who never got to experience the familys riches.

Mark Davies, , set up a tent on a small piece of land in the shadow of Leeds General Infirmary. Everyday he sits out front, crossed legged on a piece of blue tarpaulin, next to his beloved Pit Bull Terrier Luna.A sympathetic businessman let Mark pitch a tent on the land after he was forced out of his council flat by drug addicts around six months ago. Mark told Leeds Live: I had a council flat, but it was not secure and smackheads in the area took everything I had. The last thing I had was Luna and they wanted to take her, but no smackhead is taking my dog. Mark then explained why he wont stay in a homeless hostel such as St Georges Crypt, which is only a few metres away.  They dont let dogs in there, he said matter of factly. Theres one hostel on Meanwood Road, but apparently they have a separate dog kennel block. Luna wouldnt settle at all in a block with other dogs, the sight of another dog sends her crazy. I shouldnt be in a tent, I should be in a flat. Im a council tenant. But its not secure and I dont feel safe there. I feel safer here because there is always someone walking backwards and forwards.I camp here because its always in the public eye,anyone wants to try and steal my dog its going to be witnessed. Ive been attacked in the past when I was homeless, but not this time. I think its because Ive got the dog as a deterrent. Over the last few months, Mark has rarely left his new home because hes worried it will be raided. Mark, who has spent five winters of the streets of his hometown, now has three other rough sleepers with him to watch his back and his belongings. I were lucky me, because I read up on survival before I became homeless, said Mark. I know how to take care of myself and make a fire. Ive even checked the legality . But Im worried about my dog in the cold, more than myself as Im more equipped to deal with it. There are also the undesirables who come along at night. Certain people come here, see the tent and think its some bum hotel and just anyone can go in. Those people always seem to turn up at night. But not all of Marks visitors are looking to steal from him. Many give him food and spare change. In recent weeks he has been given so much food that he couldnt eat it all decided to offer it to other rough sleepers instead of throwing it out. The kindness of strangers has kept Mark and Luna fed and safe for the past few months, but he says hes determined to find a new home and live independently.

The gorgeous Cotswolds farmhouse provides a glimpse into what le has been like Sussexs so far, as they eagerly await their move to Windsor. Having turned down the chance to live in a -room apartment in Kensington Palace amid tensions with would-be neighbours Prince William and Kate Middleton, the newlyweds are said to be feeling much more at home now, having left Harry’s Nottingham Cottage behind. The stop-gap property, nestled in four acres of Oxfordshire fields, has already played hosts to a number of star-studded guests - from Amal and George Clooney, to Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian. Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland is also said to have paid a visit to the Grade II-listed home, which is valued at pound. million.   Dating back to the th century, the four bedroom property has been home for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex since May, and they will remain there as they await the completion of Frogmore Cottage ’s renovation - said to conclude early this year. It’s a fabulous place with stunning views and extraordinarily private, a source told The Sun . It’s set in a small bowl of beautul countryside so is not overlooked in any way. Meghan adores the area. She and Harry love walking the dogs there, and they can entertain their friends in complete solitude.”   The property has an converted barn attached to its exterior, which contains two kitchens on each floor, plus a scene sitting area with floor-to-ceiling windows. The grounds also have a two bedroom cottage for guests or staff, as well as an outdoor seating area with a heated patio. Harry, , and Meghan, , moved into the home shortly before their wedding in May last year. The Duchess is currently supervising the refurbishment of their soon-to-be permanent home, Frogmore Cottage, where they hope to be living before the birth of their first baby, due in late March or early April.  Frogmore Cottage has more than enough space for the Sussex family and a nursery for their baby - and even a gym or a yoga studio - with  bedrooms. Formerly known as Double Garden Cottage, the home is set within Windsor Castles Home Park and faces the stunning and sprawling grounds of Frogmore House, which will no doubt become a more popular stop on the Windsor tourist trail. The cottage is currently ided into five units which were home to royal staff, but it will be transformed into a family home with modern amenities. Frogmore Cottage is set in an area that has sentimental value and many memories for the Duke, , and Duchess, .  Its half a mile south of Windsor Castle, the Queens summer residence, and St Georges Chapel, where Harry and Meghan tied the knot in May as millions around the world watched on TV. Their wedding reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, was held at Frogmore House, which was also where the couples engagement photos were taken. They reportedly had a summer picnic there in  before getting engaged. Frogmore House is in a peaceful and secluded location, surrounded by  acres of lush vegetation and Berkshire countryside. The estate has its own man-made lake, Frogmore Lake, and is home to the Royal Burial Ground and the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  Those interred at the burial ground include King Edward VIII and his we Wallis Simpson - the orced American socialite whose intended marriage to Edward sparked a constitutional crisis and led to his abdication in . Meghan is the second American orcee to marry into the Royal Family, but unlike Wallis she has been warmly received. Frogmore House was once home to Victorias mother, the Duchess of Kent, for almost  years. Her remains are also held there, in an elegant mausoleum. The House - built in the s and purchased by Queen Charlotte, we of George III in  - is open to the public just one month a year, in August, plus three charity open days in June.  The sprawling grounds allowed Queen Charlotte to indulge her love of botany, as the gardens, initially flat, were filled with , trees and many rare and unusual plants. Charlottes Vice-Chamberlain, Major William Price, and the Rev. Christopher Alderson of Derbyshire transformed the estate, creating the winding lake, wooded mounds, glades, walks and bridges in the Picturesque style. Tickets cost up to pound a person through the Royal Collection Trust. Inside, there are grand and elegant rooms - including one decorated by th-century flower painter Mary Moser. Princess Elizabeth, the daughter of George III and Charlotte, painted garlands in The Cross Gallery.  The Britannia Room is furnished with items from the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was decommissioned in . Watercolours by Victorias daughters, Princesses Victoria and Louise, are still in the House. Public access is extremely limited because Frogmore House, currently uninhabited, is still used by the Queen and other members of the Royal Family as a retreat for private and official royal engagements. Frogmore House was built by Hugh May, Charles IIs architect, and given a name that refers to the abundance of frogs in the surrounding, low-lying marshy area. It became a royal residence about  years later and has become a hideaway for royal couples and families, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh and their children.  Victoria was fond of Frogmores peace and quiet, and it is said to have been her favourite retreat, visiting during her long widowhood and working on her papers there. Frogmore Cottage was once home to Abdul Karim, Victorias Munshi, or teacher. A summerhouse in the form of a Gothic ruin and a teahouse made for Victoria are both still standing on the estate. George VI and the Queen Mother honeymooned in the grounds in . In , it hosted the wedding reception of Princess Annes son Peter Phillips and his Canadian we Autumn.

Saul Morton was cooking eggs for himself and a pal at work when he decided to poach the eggs in a mug of water in the microwave for  seconds. The factory worker had seen the method being used on an online tutorial. However when microwaving the second egg, it blew up, showering his face in a scalding spray - even burning his left eyeball.  Thinking he literally had egg on his face when he saw white peeling from his eyelids, cheeks and nose, the processing plant sht manager was horried to realise it was his flesh falling away. Saul, who is himself a first aider, was rushed to hospital and then sent to a specialist burns unit where he received treatment. Now back at work, the -year-old is sharing painful-looking pictures of his injuries to warn others against cooking eggs in this way. Saul, from Pantymwyn, Flintshire, said: I was in agonising pain, it felt like when you spill scalding hot water out of the kettle and catch yourself - but all over my eyes and face. I ran to the bathroom from the canteen after it happened and washed my face with cold water. At first thought I had egg white stuck all over my face but then I realised it was my skin peeling off my eyelids, cheeks and nose. When that happened, and my face started to swell up, thats when I knew it was time to ring for an ambulance.  Saul, who was making the breakfast snack at .am on December , said hed cooked eggs using the same method at least  times before without a problem. Saul said: I was making bacon and egg sandwiches at work - Ive cooked eggs in this way for years and never had a problem apart from this one time. Id seen a professional cooking video showing this method on the internet but there was no warning this might happen. Id already done one egg and made a sandwich. As I removed the second egg from the cup it exploded and I saw this flash of white liquid coming towards my face. The general consensus is that a membrane formed over the water in the cup and when I pierced this with the spoon the water below flashed to steam and blew out of the cup - it was a freak accident.   Saul was rushed to Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, by ambulance where he received pain relief and his face was covered in a soothing gel dressing. He was then wrapped in the mummy-like bandages for  hours. Saul said: I was bandaged like a mummy - but the gel and bandages saved me. They put the bandages on my head and then cut slits out for my eyes and mouth so I could breathe. I couldnt see very well with them on so I stayed at my parents house. Im a big Liverpool fan and that night my dad had to describe what was going on on Match of the Day when we beat Bournemouth -. The following day he was taken to Whiston Hospitals burns unit in Prescot, Merseyside, by his dad Alan Morton where specialists examined his scorched skin and prescribed eye ointment and a weeks worth of antibiotics.   Saul said: I was in excruciating pain as some of it splashed on my left eye, but the ointment they prescribed meant there was no lasting damage. The gel forms a scab over the burns and once that was on I didnt feel anything. After a week it started dropping off and I was back at work two weeks later. It healed so well the scar clinic discharged me fairly quickly. When Saul ed to work colleagues had chipped in to buy him a novelty egg-themed gt in recognition of what hed been through. Saul said: When I went back to work the lad had bought me a game called Egg Splat - it was to be expected. Ive got a bit of a red mark on my nose but thats it. I was lucky, it could have been a hell of a lot worse. Im a safety conscious person and take all these precautions but this still happened. Poaching eggs in microwaves just isnt worth it. I just want to make people aware that this can and does happen.

Last years brutal conditions wreaked havoc for millions - trapping drivers on motorways overnight, grounding flights and forcing schools to close. This years warning has sparked fears that parts of the UK could see a repeat in the coming weeks - and Britons have been urged to prepare for severe and le-threatening winter weather. The same weather warnings and patterns from last year have been spotted again this month, with the Met Office saying an icy Siberian blast cannot be ruled out.   Before a cold snap hits, however, the UK will see above average temperatures for January over the weekend, although they wont feel pleasant in places where it is wet and windy. Wednesday got off to a cold start with temperatures dropping to -C in northern parts of the UK and -C in southern areas overnight. The Met Office warned that frost was likely on untreated roads and pavements, so drivers and pedestrians should take care. Showers are expected along some eastern fringes throughout the day, while Northern Ireland and Scotland will see cloudier and milder conditions as the day progresses.  Patchy rain will spread east, and it will be cold but dry where, with some sunny spells. Outbreaks of rain and drizzle are likely across the north in the evening, while the south will be drier with a frost overnight. On Thursday, patchy rain across northern areas will spread southwards while temperatures stay mild in most places. Friday through Sunday will be largely cloudy by generally mild, the Met Office said.  There will be some rain at times, particularly across northern areas, and it will turn breezy across the country with a risk of gales in the north. Looking further ahead, a Beast from the East could bring a spell of freezing temperatures and heavy snow, the Met Office warned. It said a sudden stratospheric warming had appeared around Christmas, when there was a sharp increase in the temperature over a couple of days. When this happens in the Arctic it can lead to a rush of cold air blowing eastwards across Europe a few weeks later, bringing much cooler temperatures to the continent.  The Met Office said this is what caused the Beast from the East early last year. Spokesman Grahame Madge said that another Beast from the East could not be ruled out, but the current forecast suggests there will be stable weather conditions. He said: Last year there was a classic set-up with the Beast from the East, there was an event in the Arctic - sudden stratospheric warming - where the stratosphere warms rapidly. That triggers, generally, a change in the direction of winds across Europe at surface level. The upshot is that normally when this happens in the Arctic you get easterly winds and thats what happened last year. But although that warming has happened in the Arctic already just prior to Christmas, we are not seeing any change in an easterly pattern. Met Office five-day forecast Wednesday Showers will affect some eastern fringes through the day, especially at first. It will turn cloudier and milder across Northern Ireland and Scotland through the day, with patchy rain spreading east. Cold but dry where, with sunny spells.

However, according to local media, scientists have warned the government that the extermination of wild boars will not bring a victory over the ASF. They have instead called for tighter sanitary and veterinarian surveillance in swine farming. Wild boar culls have become more routine as the ASF issue has been present since .   It is suspected that the virus was brought to Poland by boars migrating from Belarusian territory. According to reports, from April to November last year , wild boars were shot.

Not only was Macca a popular player in his five years at Tannadice, he also had the knack of scoring against Dundee in derbies.Even so, when he was appointed in October, there was barely a murmur of discontent over his United connection.Many others have been on both sides of the street at one time or another and been welcomed by the punters.Going direct from one to the other has not been uncommon either and, strangely, the only time there has been a fuss was with a transfer that was proposed but didn’t quite happen.That was back in the   season when both clubs were down in the old First Division and cash-strapped Dundee accepted a six-figure bid from United for their exciting young winger Neil McCann.When news of the proposed deal leaked out, however, such was the furious reaction from Dark Blues fans, the board had to call it off and, a short time later, McCann, until recently manager, was instead sold to Hearts.At other times, though, players have crossed the street with barely a whisper of complaint.It should be said that was often because the ying fortunes of the teams meant there was little the one losing one of their squad could do to prevent the move.Equally, there have been instances where fringe players at one team were allowed to go.

He brought me into the team against Inverness last month and again against Thistle on Saturday.“After Inverness I had a wee while out because of illness but he’s brought me back in again and I enjoyed it.”Despite his tender years, for the Dundonian having to impress a new manager at United is not something new.Such has been the turmoil there since he was first signed up that he’s had more gaffers than many players come across during the course of their entire careers.“I think it is about seven managers I’ve had here now and I’m only , so there have been a few. It is tough because I’ve never had a manager who has brought me into the team and given me a run of games. I’m glad the manager has given me my chance now and it’s up to me to take it.“He had been great with me, he speaks to me in training and it’s been good for me.“There a few of us young boys, some even younger than myself, that can get a chance.“The manager will also bring a few more new players in as well during this window because it’s not really his squad yet and we’ll see what develops.“He’s played me out wide. I’d like to play in the holding role in the middle because I’ve played there as well but, even though the manager has started me on the wing, he wants us to come into the middle and get on the ball there.”Smith has performed well under his new boss at a time when United have been struggling to maintain the momentum they were building shortly after his arrival.The youngster admits that’s been frustrating but believes United are not far away from ing to winning ways on a regular basis.“Saturday was very frustrating. After Ayr and Ross County dropping points we were looking to get a victory but it wasn’t to be.“Partick came at us first half to be fair to them. I thought in the second half we were very good and we can, hopefully, take that into this week against Dunfermline.“There are no bad teams in this league and, at times, you just need to battle it out in games.“We did that in the first half and I think in the second half we showed up better.“We got the goal back in that second half and then had a lot of chances to win the game, we should have been more clinical and finished them off.“We need to keep grinding results out.

It’s phenomenal.“They’re like children in a sweet shop the way that they attack them.“It’s the nutrients in the bark that they love so much, because trees can pick up some trace minerals from the ground that grass and other things can’t.”Specialising in rare breeds, Sarah chose to get bagot goats – one of the rarest in the UK with only around  left in the country – in a bid to clear weeds from her fields.Sarah has been caring for rare breeds for more than  years, in a bid to preserve them for the future.She is on the hunt for real trees that have been used over the Christmas period, but that haven’t been sprayed with anything such as fake snow or articial pine scents.Trees that have been kept close to kitchens will also not be accepted, because of the chance of contamination with food, which could cause an outbreak of foot and mouth.For Sarah, asking for the trees was an easy decision, especially as there is currently a hay shortage.She said: “There’s a huge waste of trees around this time of year, it seems criminal – especially this year when fodder is in such short supply, because a lot of the silage and hay has already been used.”This is the third year Sarah has recycled trees and she has been kept busy trailing across the north-east picking up trees from people.She said: “It’s been absolutely fantastic, I’ve even had some of the village trees that have been standing out in the squares. They’re fantastic because they’re usually quite green.“It’s been a great response from the local community.”Despite the fact the goats don’t eat the wood of the trees, Sarah manages to find a use for it, whether it be for kindling for her wood burner, or passing it on to a lady in the village who makes wooden children’s toys.She said: “Every part of the trees I get is used in some way.“The things I can’t burn, I put out the back to rot for the insects.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13808455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_shr_ayp_281218weight2.jpg","title":"woman lost weight after deciding","story":"NewsWoman lost weight after deciding to do something before it was out of controlThe -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier.ShareByStephen Houston:,  JAN NewsDeborah Biggar \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHer name is a headline writer’s dream. For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"campbells-return-is-written-in-verse","story":"RETURNING rector Campbell Wilson was given a warm

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming.

And then also people need to be thinking about training, and getting people to raise this a bit more proactively in consultations, and then how to handle it when you find it.The report, published in the British Medical Journal, analysed nine studies on the prevalence of reproductive control in women from  to . It defines the phenomenon as ldquoactions that interfere with a womanrsquos reproductive intentions and any actions that pressurise a woman into initiating or terminating pregnancy.Primarily carried out by intimate partners, it can also be perpetrated by the wider family and in organised crime, with young people and ethnic minorities particularly vulnerable.Actions include emotional blackmail, threats of violence, pressure to continue or end apregnancy or to not use certain types of contraception.It also includes ldquocontraceptive sabotage, such as a male partner ly saying they have had a vasectomy, piercing condoms before use, or ldquostealthing, where a condom is covertly removed during sex.Some women may not have insight into their relationship, especiallythere is no physical or sexual violence, as they may become inured to the control being exerted on them.Describing how it could manest, Mr Rowlands said: ldquoI think it is like a spectrum, at the worst extreme end there probably is violence and extreme things going on like food deprivation, on the other end itrsquos really just a kind of psychologically controlling atmosphere ndash keeping tabs on everything the woman is doing, maybe being restrictive over when she goes out.However, Mr Rowlands said that, for many women, the issue was not being raised during consultations. He said there were no UK guidelines or advice for health professionals, the majority of whom ldquowere not terribly aware and would not be thinking about raising this.Health professionals who were conscious of it were responding on an inidual basis to inidual patients, he said.The report is calling for screening to take place in maternity, sexual and reproductive health and abortion services and GP surgeries, with a set of questions already devised.Professionals should be alert to its possibility.

Not that we were left loo-less for long, with no thoroughly modern, Presto-toting town centre being thought complete in those heady days unless it boasted a brand spanking new toilet block too. Complete with bleach-wielding attendant, of course.Fast forward to , however, and those well-tended toilets are facing an uncertain future, with Aberdeenshire Council last year transferring responsibility for them to a local heritage group as part of a cost-cutting drive. The group has vowed to keep them running for the foreseeable future, with a community-spirited local cleaner and a couple of helpers stepping in to provide their services free of charge.The situation is far from unique. Research published in this newspaper last month showed that across Scotland the number of public toilets has reduced by  per cent in the past five years, with a third of the  that remain expected to be sold off or closed in the coming months. In towns and villages across the country solutions are being found, with local authorities paying small sums to local businesses infor public access to their facilities in a so-called lsquocomfort partnershiprsquo arrangement.As in my home town, other community groups have taken full responsibility for their local loos, with the Cumbrae Community Development Company - aka The Cumbrae Cludgies - proving just how successful community ownership can be after taking over management of the islandrsquos six public toilets in . Millport has been judged Hidden Scotlandrsquos most beautul town and its Newton Beach one of Keep Scotland Beautulrsquos best beaches since, with its gleaming toilets helping clinch the awards.Yet despite the stellar work being done by Cumbrae lsquoCludgie Cleanerrsquo Suki McGregor, who not only ensures the facilities are kept pristine but promotes the island in YouTube videos too, the group has turned to crowdfunding in a bid to raise the pound, needed for its survival. Running toilets is an expensive business, you see.But is it an expensive business that the public should pay for from the good of its heart through donations of time or money, or should our publicly funded bodies continue to foot the bill  A decade on from the advent of former prime minister David Cameronrsquos Age of Austerity, we all know money is tight, but Irsquom still willing to argue itrsquos the latter.It goes without saying that the loss of public toilets sends a negative message to the visitors our rural communities depend on in order to thrive. Itrsquos one thing throwing money at advertising campaigns whose romanticised vision of our hills, glens, food and drink is designed to lure tourists in, butthey canrsquot access even the most basic of services once they get here theyrsquore hardly likely to give us a glowing review.Andwelcoming holiday-makers isnrsquot your thing, think on this: without easy access to a public loo many elderly members of our communities, whose social interactions have already been curtailed by the automation of pension payments, the closure of local banks and the soaring cost of a cup of tea, may well give up on venturing down the town altogether. Consigning the elderly or infirm to their homes rather than finding ways of ensuring they can remain a part of the community is hardly the mark of a civilised society.And that, really, is the crux: far from being a simple inconvenience, the loss of public lavatories serves as a reminder of just how uncivilised our society has become. From streets smeared with dog dirt to towns left without libraries, the symptoms are everywhere. The narrative might be that by closing toilets councils are cutting back on a service they are not legally obliged to provide, but the wider story is that after a decadersquos worth of austerity-led budget cuts we have been reduced to accepting the budget version of civic le.The latest manestation is the introduction of fees for school music tuition, a move that is to be derided not just because it separates out the rich from the poor but because it implies that only the former are deserving of enriching experiences. In West Lothian alone, , school kids have dropped out of music lessons since an annual fee of pound was introduced. If that isnrsquot a wake-up call that austerity isnrsquot working, what is On its website the Cumbrae Community Development Company states that ldquoa community that cares about its public toilets sends out a strong message about the type of community it is.

Yes, Defoersquos goalscoring rate has dropped in the last two seasons but there are a couple of mitigating factors here. Firstly, that during   Defoe was tasked with banging in the goals for a truly dreadful Sunderland side that looked destined for relegation from the opening day. And secondly, that last season at Bournemouth he was a bit-part player, often coming off the bench and rarely given a run in Eddie Howersquos starting XI.If we take Defoersquos average goals per  minutes over the last three seasons as a representative sample, the figure we arrive at is .. Itrsquos important to point out that these are goals scored in the English Premier League, where the standard is higher than the Scottish Premiership, yet even going by these numbers it appears Defoe will have plenty to offer to Rangers during his time at Ibrox.:Rangers boss Steven Gerrard calls for respect to be shown towards referees after Old Firm fall outA more in-depth look at Defoersquos numbers reveals that the veteran strikerrsquos role has been changing in recent seasons. Where Defoe has traditionally been characterised as a goalscorer, we can see that as age catches up with the -year-old, his style of play has evolved.We can see that Defoersquos goalscoring has dropped signicantly - particularly last season when he wasnrsquot featuring regularly for Bournemouth - but other aspects of his game have actually improved in recent campaigns. While the English forward is scoring fewer goals and hitting fewer shots, his accuracy has increased to the point where the majority of his efforts on goal are on target.Interestingly, Defoersquos expected goalshas remained fairly consistent during this time, implying that hersquos still being given the same number and quality of goalscoring opportunities during any given match, but hersquos converting fewer of them. This may be slightly worrying for Rangers supporters, but they can take heart from the fact that Defoersquos team play has improved over the same period. The number of key passes - passes that lead directly to a shot - that Defoe averages more than doubled last season and the number of touches that hersquos taking in the opposition box has also risen.Defoersquos dribbling has suffered at the same time, however, with the number of attempted dribbles per  minutes dropping from . to . and with good reason in  , around % of the forwardrsquos dribbles were successful, but that figure plummeted to % last season.All in all, then, it looks as though Defoe still has plenty to offer and should prove to be an important player for Rangers during the second half of the season. Gerrard has already asserted that Defoe is ldquoa very young -year-old and that the striker ldquohas a shape to die for in terms of how he looks after himself in response to questions about age creeping up on the forward. The stats suggest that, naturally for a player Defoersquos age, there has been a drop-off in some aspects of his game, but his goalscoring record throughout his career suggests that he wonrsquot struggle to find the net this season. Whether or not Defoe has what it takes to make it in Scotland remains to be seen but there are plenty of reasons for the Rangers support to be optimistic about his arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-cameron-leigh-griffiths-gets-my-sympathy-but-why-does-he-make-his-life-so-damn-difficult","story":"Itrsquos luck, really, which allows us to show the world whatever our inidual talent handed out at birth happens to be.For example, had I been raised in the Amazon Basin instead of directly across the road from a pub, would my genius, the right word, trick of flicking up a beer mat and catching it with the same hand before it hits the table ever have been discovered There are a select few blessed with such incredible talent that it elevates them above almost all of the rest, an ability which even in an elite field marks them out as someone truly special.Leigh Grfiths is one of them.This is someone possessed with a ridiculous amount of natural talent for kicking a ball with a left foot which could double up as a wand. He should have been one of Scotlandrsquos all-times greats.Many years ago, I took a trip through to Edinburgh to write up a feature on Hutchison Vale, the football club which boasts a ridiculous number of ex-players who went onto play professionally.John Collins, Darren Fletcher, almost everyone who has ever played for Hibs, and Allan McGregor are just some of the graduates. The list goes on and on.While there, I asked who was the most naturally gted player to ever darken the door of Hutchie Vale, thinking it would be Fletcher. The answer I got has never left me.A coach said that it was the young lad who then had only just broken through at Livingston, and was scoring goals for fun, who beat Collins and Fletcher, two modern greats of Scottish football.It was put to me Leigh Grfiths was the best that club had seen but there was a problem. He was something of a lad. Easily led and prone to distraction.And Irsquom putting it mildly.Just the other day someone I respect in football said to me that Grfiths should be playing for a team at the top of the English or German league. Hersquos that good, this man said and he knows what hersquos talking about.But with Grfiths there is always a but.He denied this week he is a gambling addict, insisting his problem is with mental health issues. If this is  per cent true, and I suspect it is not, I sympathise. I suffer from depression and know how much it can affect the le of anyone. I wish him well.But ndash that word again ndash this fragile and complicated character who while deserving of our best wishes is really pushing Celtic. I am beginning to think hersquos played his last game for the club.Grfiths has been warned time and again to live properly, live better, get fitter, and to an extent he has done. But itrsquos not nearly enough.He should not have been at a Newcastle Racecourse in a bight red lsquolook at mersquo jacket seemingly putting on bets. He shouldnrsquot have been posing for pictures. Not right now, not when he is off for ldquoongoing issues while being paid handsomely by his club.It may seem like Irsquom kicking a man when hersquos down, please believe me thatrsquos not the case, but the last thing someone in his position needs is more hassle, which of course he got online. He responded which only added to the initial regrettable headlines.How many chances is he going to get  Not every penny has dropped. The heid has never been fully screwed tight. The next piece of silliness was never far away. Itrsquos ashersquos as good at self-sabotage as he is at scoring goals.Grfiths is troubled but has a good heart. Itrsquos just that he is man seemingly incapable of dragging himself clear of chaos. Hersquos the pal who can get into an argument and then a fight while putting out a milk bottle. Trouble finds him and this now -year-old has to take a lot of responsibility for that.Grfiths loves Celtic. But maybe it is time for him to leave. Neil Lennon and he get on well and it seems to me that a move to his beloved Hibernian might be best for all parties.This guy could have been anything.Therersquos still time for this natural born goalscorer to, for the umpteenth time, show all of us doubters how wrong we are.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Wednesday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams. In a tribute Mary Lou said: \"Ní bheidh a leithéid arís ann agus mara dúirt Jer féin go  minic an Phoblacht abú.\"Deepest sympathy is extended to Jer’s daughters Noraand Clare and to all his extended family.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27512  ","story":"The attack at Burntollet Bridge. Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonIt is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.Peoples Democracyemerged as one of the constituent parts of the wider Civil Rights Movementin the north of Ireland during the late s.It was a collective of radical students influenced like the rest of the emergent CRM by global events and motivated by a resolve to bring an end to the injustices of the then unionist state.Inspired by the political example of the Selma to Montgomery march organised by the American CRM, the PD and notably without the approval of the wider CRM, decided to march from Belfast to Derry in a highly symbolic protest against the denial of democratic and civil rights in the north.The march began on st January and eventually arrived in Derry on Saturday th January .  But, not before it was violently confronted by unionist extremists, supported by members of the B-Specials state militia, as it passed through Antrim town and Randalstown in South Antrim, and then most notoriously at Burntollet Bridge, outside Claudy and finally again at Irish Street in Derry, before finally arriving at the citys Guildhall.and Brackareilly, near Maghera.Where the route of the march was blocked by unionists, local people provided transport to the next clear point on the journey.Among the numbers to join and support the marchers as it passed through South Antrim and South Derry were local republicans, including IRA volunteers and members of the then Republican Clubs local Hibernians, social democrats, as well as other progressive minded people, who recognised the importance of the march, and respected those participating. The Long March to Derry as it came to be known made its own historic contribution to the demise of the old unionist regime in the north of Ireland.So to mark this landmark event, fty years on from the actual date of the ambush on the marchers at Burntollet, Sinn Féin in my South Antrim constituency organised an evening of reminiscence and political discussion, compered by the author and Sinn Féins former Director of Publicity, Danny Morrison.A specially produced video by Noel and Noel Óg Maguire was shown, sharing local peoples eye witness accounts and recollections of what happened in Antrim, Randalstown, Toome, and also at Burntollet.Civil rights veterans, and former Sinn Féin MLAs, Mary Nelis and Mitchel Mc Laughlin, and myself then participated in a  discussion.That reviewed the pre-civil rights period, how the CRM came into existence, and how the civil rights era gave way to the political conflict, leading up to the peace process, and the present day political situation.It was an excellent event, with an audience spanning three or four generations from South Antrim and South Derry.Some present were reconnecting with historical events which they helped shape, and which in turn shaped them: others were of an age to draw parallels between their own contemporary experiences of rights denied today with the denial of rights fty years ago.What the Long March to Derry in , and the sequence of other events of that same year, climaxing with the pogroms of August , brought sharply into focus was that partition remained the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society: and, that the denial of civil rights in the north was, and remains inisible from the denial of Irish national independence. Following the RUC assault on the civil rights marchers in Duke Street, Derry, on th October , the Long March to Derry again exposed for a world audience the institutionalised sectrarianism of the northern state, and extent of unionist opposition to the equality and rights agenda.Nothing would ever be the same again.It took a further thirty years before the Good Friday Agreementdrew a line under the use of political violence provided the political architecture of the Irish peace process and, established in legislation equality and human rights for all citizens in many ways the GFA addressed what the CRM did not resolve.It gave expression with an internationally binding treaty to the crux of the CRM agenda, by establishing the bench marks of equality, rights, and respect for all citizens.It became our societys road map away from the legacy of political violence towards the achievement of a rights based society, with parity of esteem, mutual respect and anti-sectarianism, at its core.Both the British and Irish governments have failed to fully implement the GFA.Just as the unionist state in  opposed the CRM, signicant sections of political unionism have pushed back against the GFA since .It is a scandal that still fty years after political extremists beat civil rights marchers from Belfast to Derry off the roads in opposition to a rights based society,  a new generation of political unionists now continues to oppose the development of a rights based society and proper power sharing.And, that is the fundamental reason why the democratic political institutions in the north remain suspended and why the GFA faces its greatest ever threat.Make no mistake, there is a deep systemic crisis in the north of Ireland.Now that crisis is deepening with the onset of the Brexit catastrophe.Brexit has swept away all of the previously established assumptions about the constitutional, political and economic status quo in Ireland north and south.A solution to the depth of this crisis will only be found through negotiation and decisive political leadership, which commands the authority to make and keep agreements, and embrace and deliver change.Those who marched from Belfast to Derry fty years ago this week were a microcosm of the wider CRM.They were students and others, including, republicans, social democrats, communists, socialists, trade unionists, and labour members. They were from dferent religious back grounds, and none.The timeless lesson of the CRM which applies to our current situation is that the type of progressive alliances which stood up for rights in  are still required today in .We need progressive and democratic alliances to defend the GFA to stand up against the scourge of Brexit to achieve a Bill of Rights and, secure the fundamental language, legacy, marriage, and womens health rights which are enjoyed where in Ireland and Britain.The British and Irish governments should not make the mistake of underestimating the momentum for change which exists, or the expectations of nationalist and other sections of progressive opinion.We have come full circle. The extremists within political unionism must not be allowed to hold back change.The days of second class citizenship are over.The post civil rights generations will never again be pushed to the back of the bus.Fundamental change in relations between Ireland and Britain is now unavoidable.Importantly, progressive and democratic alliances will also be required to persuade and convince a majority as to the desirability and achievability of an agreed, constitutional Irish national democracy, which guarantees a future for all our people based upon rights, respect and reconciliation.A year of new challenges lies ahead in .Those aspiring for maximum change must remain focussed upon the bigger picture. There can be room for complacency. The momentum for change must not relax. needs to be a year of more and louder voices, greater advocacy, and increased popular mobilisation for democratic rights and change.Let us all ensure that  echoes to the clarion call of those iconic words...We shall overcome.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8762174.1546960857!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley nationalism only survives by talking down northern ireland","story":"A war of words has broken out between unionists and nationalists over plans to celebrate the th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland.The bitter row started after a proposal was put to the unionist-dominated Mid and East Antrim Council to mark the centenary of the formation of the Province in .DUP MP Ian Paisley reacted angrily to remarks made by SDLP Mid and East Antrim councillor Declan OLoanThe DUP motion calls on the local authority to celebrate the achievements of people from the Province, and to commemorate signicant events that have taken place over the last century, including the Second World War, the Belfast Blitz and the Troubles.Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy has described the move as “an attempt to rewrite the history of the brutality and repression created by partition”.But DUP group leader on the council, Alderman Gregg McKeen, said he wanted any event which marked the creation of NI to be “inclusive”, and accused Mr Murphy of “cranking up sectarian ision”.While the motion received overwhelming support at the council’s monthly meeting on Monday, Sinn Fein’s Patrice Hardy and SDLP’s Declan O’Loan voted against it.SDLP Mid and East Antrim councillor Declan OLoan said Northern Ireland was an economic and social failureSpeaking at the meeting, Mr O’Loan said there was “not much reason” to celebrate the creation of NI, describing the Province as “nothing but an economic and social failure”.He told elected members: “At partition, the six counties contributed % of Ireland’s industrial output, and Belfast was the biggest city.The situation has now totally reversed.Exports from Ireland in  were €bn, while in NI they were €bn. “We are as ided a society as ever we were. Violence is endemic, paramilitary groups continue their activity, we have had numerous years when no local government was possible, and the Assembly hasn’t sat for the last two years.”Mr O’Loan’s remarks sparked a strong reaction from Ian Paisley, who said nationalist rhetoric “can only surviveit talks down the Union and NI”. The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Not initially aware of his good fortune, the two cash-strapped women learn that their patient won’t be around for long and are then faced with a moral dilemma of should they or shouldn’t they… Long time Marie Jones collaborator Katie Tumelty told Daily Belfast how the play has a “universal voice” in its themes that are as prevalent today as when the play was first performed back in .“This play deals with the working woman, in this case two care workers who are running to and from the people that they care for on a daily basis,” she said. “Their work is invaluable to so many families but in the cases of Frances and Loretta there is more going on behind the scenes. Marie’s play deals with poverty, death and dilemma but at the same time has so much humour running throughout it.“Both characters are hard workers, they have stresses in work, stresses at home and they are just trying to make ends meet and get through their working day. I play the character of Frances who looks at the same sky as everyone  every morning, has hopes, aspirations and it’s like many peoplethe situation arises – what to doa small amount of money, should it be £ or £, comes their way, do they take it “What starts out as a tiny grain of sand soon becomes an avalanche for the two women to deal with. The piece is Marie at her finest,” she added.Katie continued: “Everybody knows a Frances or a Loretta, they are going in and out of hundreds of home every day to help those in their care. I remember so many times being stopped in the Kennedy Centre with people saying that the show should be on prescription, that Marie should be getting her wages through the NHS such is the tonic the show has proven to be.”Fly Me To The Moon and its message have been welcomed around the world on stages in New York, Canada, Sweden and most recently Iceland.“For this run I’m performing with Abigail McGibbon and it’s like a homecoming for her as she performed the part back at the start. It’s great to be bringing the show to the Grand Opera House main auditorium for the week and we will be touring down south once the curtain comes down on the .“There is no doubt that those coming to see it will leave with a message and huge laughs in what is a very current, relevant piece of theatre.”Fly Me To The Moon will be performed at the Grand Opera House from January  to .

We were found wanting and the players know that.#The only thing I will take from that is that it had reinforced in my own mind some of the players who are stepping up and others we will have to review.#Antrim actually hit the first point of the game through Paddy McBride in the opening minute, but they were to be swamped at the other end with the points flowing for Armagh before a stray Colm Fleming kick-out gave Ryan McShane a gt of a goal to move Armagh - to - ahead on  minutes.Their second major arrived a minute later, this time from a Jamie Clarke penalty after another stray pass resulted in Rory Grugan being hauled back in the area.By the time McBride added to the Antrim tally on  minutes, the game was gone as Clarke and man-of-the-match Stefan Campbell caused havoc at the other end with Armagh leading - to - at the half.McGeeney#s charges did appear to take their foot off the gas a little in the second half, but it was hard to blame them as the game became rather pedestrian.Credit to the hosts who kept plugging away with Niall Delargy and McBride leading the way in attack and they did grab a consolation goal through Eoghan McCabe with the last act of the game, but this was a rare blemish for Armagh who were worthy winners.“It’s the old adage of goals win games and once you concede two in three minutes it#s massive,” Harbinson added.“Armagh#s tackling was very good too and I thought maybe in the second half we were blown up for some easier stuff, but that#s the inconsistencies.“Armagh showed the desire of getting men forward and breaking lines, but we were just a bit slow in doing that.“It#s disappointing because the boys are working really hard and we know they are. We made eight changes from last week against Monaghan because we#re using the McKenna Cup to look at players, although some were enforced on us through injury. When you make all those changes, you run the risk against a very good team of being exposed and that#s what#s happened.”ANTRIM: C Fleming P Brannigan, R Johnston, A Sweeney P Finnegan, D Lynch, P Gallagher M Sweeney, E Walsh M McCarry, M Fitzpatrick, C DuffinK Quinn , E McCabe , P McBride .

Theresa May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit “backstop” is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year..pushThe promise came as the Government released details of new measures for Northern Ireland designed to win over critics of the backstop, in a last-ditch bid to win support for her Withdrawal Agreement in a crucial vote next Tuesday.Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions ahead of the opening of a five-day debate on her plans, Mrs May insisted that the agreement was a good deal and urged MPs to support it.She dismissed a call from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn that she should rule out a no-deal Brexit and “do the right thing” and call a general electionshe loses next week’s vote.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Theresa May addressed Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons before the start of a five-day debate on her Brexit plans And she brushed aside a plea from Conservative grandee Kenneth Clarke to take “the obvious step in the national interest”her Withdrawal Agreement is defeated and delay or revoke the Article  process.A further challenge to Mrs May’s control over the withdrawal process came as Speaker John Bercow permitted a debate on a cross-party proposal which would force her to come back to the Commons within three days of a defeat to set out her next steps.Mrs May is understood to have told Cabinet that she will respond quicklyher proposals are rejected by MPs, raising speculation that a “Plan B” could be outlined as early as the end of next week.She told MPs that she was still hoping to receive “further clarication” from Brussels on the backstop arrangements before next week’s vote.And she assured them that her plans would allow them a vote on whether to extend the Brexit transition period or trigger the backstopno agreement on future UK EU relations has been reached by the end of .“I can tell the House that, in the event that our future relationship or alternative arrangements are not ready by the end of , Parliament will have a vote on whether to seek to extend the implementation period or bring the backstop into effect,” she said.Mr Corbyn asked: “Will the Prime Minister listen to the clearly expressed will of the House last night, end this costly charade and rule out no deal ”But Mrs May replied: “The only way to avoid no deal is to vote for the deal.”Labour frontbencher Barry Gardiner said the party would immediately table a no confidence vote in the Government in the event of a defeat next week, in the hope of forcing an early general election.But Mr Corbyn went a step further in suggesting that the PM should stand downher plans are rejected, asking: “If her deal is defeated next week – as I hope and expect it will – will the Prime Minister do the right thing and let the people have a real say and call a general election ”.Mrs May responded: “No. We put a good deal on the table that protects jobs and security.”I dont think that the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative dealsDavid LidingtonFacebookTwitterOne of the PM’s closest lieutenants, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster David Lidington, accused critics of her plans of peddling “fantasies” about other possible Brexit deals.In a last-minute plea to rebels to accept the deal drawn up over two years of negotiations with Brussels, Mrs May’s de facto deputy told the BBC: “I don’t think that the British public are served by fantasies about magical alternative deals that are somehow going to sort of spring out of a cupboard in Brussels.”Governments of the  remaining EU states “are very clear, in conversations I have had with them as well as their public statements, they ain’t going to be going back and unpicking this for some brand new brilliant renegotiations”, he said.“So, the choice that people have is this deal, or it is no deal, or it is, as some MPs advocate, to reverse the  referendum entirely.”Next week’s historic showdown comes after the Prime Minister dramatically pulled a vote before Christmas, admitting she was heading for defeat in the face of opposition from both pro-Leave and pro-Remain Tories.The PM was due to hold a drinks reception for MPs at Number  as she continues her desperate efforts to fend off humiliation in a vote which could determine the fate of her administration.In new proposals unveiled shortly before the start of debate on the PM’s deal, the Government pledged to give the currently suspended Northern Ireland Assembly a “strong role”the contentious border backstop proposal is ever triggered.If a wider EU UK trade deal fails to materialise by the end of the transition period in , there would be a legally-binding commitment to “consult” with Stormont before deciding to either enter the backstop or ask for an extension.But Democratic Unionist Party Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson rejected the proposals as “window dressing”, telling Sky News: “The only deal which could swing the DUP round isthe backstop as it applies to the United Kingdom as a whole, or to Northern Ireland specically, were removed from this agreement.”No British Government or NI Assembly will be able to escape the legally binding commitments which would prevailthis diabolical deal were to pass.

On Monday he said no-deal preparations were too little too late.“He can’t have it both ways – either we’re doing too much or too little.“So perhaps he can break his usual habit and actually give us a decision – which is it ”If her deal is defeated next week, as I hope and expect it will, will the Prime Minister do the right thing and let the people have a real say and call a general election Labour leader Jeremy CorbynFacebookTwitterMr Corbyn again pushed for no-deal to be ruled out before telling the Commons: “The Prime Minister has spent the last week begging for warm words from EU leaders and achieved nothing – not one single dot or comma has changed.“She’s already squandered millions of pounds of public money on last-minute, half-baked planning for a no-deal that was rejected last night.“So,her deal is defeated next week, as I hope and expect it will, will the Prime Minister do the right thing and let the people have a real say and call a general election ”Mrs May replied: “No. We’ve put a good deal on the table that protects jobs and security.“But I noticed in all of that we still don’t know what Brexit planhas.”Mrs May highlighted apparent contradictions in Mr Corbyn’s approach to Brexit, adding: “The one thing we know aboutis his Brexit policies are the many, not the few.”Both leaders began PMQs by condemning abuse hurled at MPs and journalists in the areas surrounding Parliament.It comes after Conservative former minister Anna Soubry was branded a “Nazi” by protesters during television interviews.The PM said: “Politicians and the media should be able to go about their work without harassment and intimidation.”Mr Corbyn added: “We have to be clear that intimidation is wrong outside this building, as it is wrong in any other aspect of le in this country, and we have to create a safe space for political debate.”SNP Commons leader Pete Wishart later described the Prime Minister’s deal as the “deadest dodo”.He said: “Parliamentary defeats are now a regular feature of her Government, she’s lost a quarter of her Cabinet and  of her backbenchers want her gone, her deal is as dead as the deadest dodo.“How many more indignities can this Prime Minister endure before she realises that she is the biggest part of this problem and for goodness’ sake just go ”Mrs May responded, saying her Government had negotiated a deal that “delivers on the referendum result”.Labour MP Stephen Kinnockpushed Mrs May to give MPs, including Government ministers, a free vote to decide the next course of actionher deal is rejected on Tuesday.She replied: “I am working to ensure that the deal that has been negotiated by the UK Government with the European Union is voted positively on by this Parliament.”"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter reacts as netflix reveals alternative ending to interactive bandersnatch","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He again made this call as the British Government confirmed the next stage of the universal credit rollout is to be scaled back. The Ballyarnett councillorsaid: “The SDLP has been consistently clear that scaling back Universal Credit is not good enough. Its roll out must be halted until there is urgent and radical reform, not least when it comes to the minimum five week wait for first payment and the two child rule. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“The delay in moving people onto Universal Credit is an admission by the Tory Government that this system is flawed and is causing hurt and hardship, but this delay does not protect people. In effect it means more people are likely to lose out and be worse off as they are left to move on to Universal Credit under managed migration or premature migration where they will automatically lose the premiums they are currently receiving and rely on to make ends meet.“It is also interesting to hear parties like Sinn Féin who, along with the DUP and Alliance, voted to enable the introduction of Universal Credit in the north call for it to be scrapped.

Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

May#s proposed Brexit deal shows a widespread belief thatthe Northern Irish backstop is ever implemented it would increase the chances of a united Ireland.The poll, which was commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign arguing for a second referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU, was conducted in mid-December and shown to the News Letter yesterday.The poll was conducted south of the border in DecemberThe research shows a particularly strong belief among young people that the backstop would fuel support for removing the border, with% of under s stating that the backstop would make Irish unity more likely.The People’s Vote campaign said that they had not asked any other questions as part of the poll, so it is not possible to compare how southern voters view the backstop in comparison to alternatives such as leaving the EU without a deal or not leaving the EU at all.The backstop – to be triggeredno other solution can be agreed to prevent a hard border – would involve Northern Ireland remaining aligned with some EU rules eventhe rest of the UK erges.Respondents were asked: “Do you think the Backstop section of the Brexit deal will make the eventual prospect of a United Ireland”, followed by a list of options from “a lot more likely” to “a lot less likely”.Just % thought it made Irish unity less likely, while % said that it would be more likely and % said that it would make no dference.However, there was a huge disparity across the generations. Among the middle-aged, just % thought the backstop makes unity more likely – but among under s, that figure more that doubled.The belief that the backstop would make unity more likely was also higher in border areas and other traditionally more republican areas such as Cork and Kerry.The polling, conducted in the run-up to Christmas, saw , adults being interviewed by pollsters Ireland Thinks. Eighty per cent of the interviews were by phone, with the rest conducted online. When asked who funded the research, the People’s Vote campaign said that most of its money came from public donations but that it has some large unnamed donors.Former secretary of state Lord Hain appealed to the DUP to not only reject Theresa May’s proposed deal, but also reject a no-deal Brexit and instead support a second referendum. The Labour peer, who backs a second referendum, said: “The DUP’s decision to back Brexit may yet come to embarrass them because there is no prospect of any sort of deal with the European Union that does not involve a backstop – and Irish voters see this as a step towards a united Ireland.Nationalist and republican parties now ‘anti-Catholic’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The DUP must also know that a ‘no deal’ would be a catastrophe for Northern Ireland, especially for farming communities in the border regions. The one thing the DUP is known for is having tactical ‘nous’ and the logic for them – as it must be for MPs of all parties in the House of Commons – is to back the idea of the public being given the final say in a new vote where people will be given an option of staying in the EU with the deal we’ve already got.”But the DUP’s Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said that the  vote had been UK-wide and “the result must be respected and implemented”.He said: “The party has been consistent on the backstop. It is not needed. No one is building a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Indeed, with every day that passes, it is becoming clearer that not even the Republic of Ireland ever believed the hard border spin. “The backstop will place a border between Northern Ireland and GB. That is unacceptable both constitutionally and economically. If the EU really cared about Northern Ireland, they would be no more willing to build an east-west border than they are to build a north-south border.”Mr Dodds said that his party wants to see “an orderly exit from the EU”. However, he added: “That can be achieved but EU intransigence must be replaced by a recognition that the backstop is not acceptable.”try catch            ..

This is good for them and this is good for both colleges.“But what about the other % who do not, in particular what about those who are the most educationally vulnerable in the Lurgan area, why should their future be decided by those who go to Portadown schools or who are likely to be selected for one of the colleges.“The Education Authorityhave been working toward a solution and as part of that solution a number of options have been identied.“One of those options is for the children in Lurgan to stay in Lurgan and for the Lurgan Junior High Schools to become an – school with academic selection still taking place allowing children to go to the Lurgan College at . “However, this option is being discounted because of the words of the last Education Minister in June  where he made it clear that the Dickson Plan would not be removed ‘either directly or undermined through stealth’.“Yet it is clear that the Dickson plan is not being undermined and that selection will still take place at  with the option to go to Lurgan College at that time. Traffic and travel: M now reopened after SEVEN vehicle collisionMan charged over burglaries Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Therefore the former Minister’s words are being used not as they were intended but in an attempt to dissuade support for change. The adding of this statement will do nothing but reignite the bitter dispute around the Dickson Plan when there is no need to do so. It will feed into the fear of those parents and communities throughout the area who feel there is an attack on the Dickson Plan.“In itself it will create a negative response and fear that schools in Portadown will somehow be affected by a plan for Lurgan that puts Lurgan pupils and the Lurgan community at its heart.“I have been absolutely clear onwhere I stand on this issue. The children in Lurgan cannot stay at the Lurgan Campus site on Kitchen Hill, it is simply not fit for purpose, while bussing them to Portadown to a consolidated CSHS would be detrimental to the children and the wider Lurgan community.“Therefore creating an educational hub in Lurgan on the site of the Lurgan Junior High School through the provisions of - education would enhance education in the area while at the same time retaining the guidelines of the Dickson Plan with no detrimental effect on post primary schools and education in the wider Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee area.“I am now calling on all elected representatives from all political parties in the area, civic leaders and educationalists to get behind a proposal for Lurgan Junior High School to become an - school with academic selection remaining at . I’m asking for parents from Portadown, Lurgan and Tandragee whose child is likely to go to one of the colleges or to the Portadown Campus of CSHS to support a Lurgan solution and I am asking the Board of Governors, teachers and Principals of Tandragee Junior High School, Clounagh Junior High School and Killicomaine Junior High School to support this bespoke solution for Lurgan and finally allow stability for those children and the community of Lurgan who have been badly forgotten over the last  years to finally have a sustainable post primary educational pathway.”An Education Authorityspokesperson said: “Craigavon Senior High School currently provides vitally important post-primary education services to the Craigavon area and currently operates across two campuses. “EA is undertaking consultation on how future provision at Craigavon Senior High School will be shaped. The purpose of this consultation is to seek the views of those most directly involved at a local level and will begin on Monday,  January, . “The consultation events will provide an opportunity to explore all of the facts and discuss the issues which will help shape future provision at Craigavon Senior High School for many years to come. “A letter inviting parents, staff and governors to participate in consultation events was issued on Monday,  January, . Consultation will also be undertaken with pupils during January .” try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs Little acted dishonestly by preparing s she knew were not completed nor accurate.Little was also ordered to pay pound, toward the ldquovery substantial prosecution costs.South Thanet MP Mr Mackinlay, , had been accused of failing to declare more than pound, spent on staffing, hotels and advertising.Prosecutors said he ignored strict spending limits to beat Mr Farage, and told Southwark Crown Court Mr Mackinlayrsquos victory could have been declared void had the true position been known.But a jury at Southwark Crown Court acquitted him of two charges of knowingly making a  election expenses declaration under the Representation of the People Act  after deliberating for  hours and  minutes, having retired on December .Mr Farage told the Press Association: ldquoThis verdict shows that there are no election rules for the big parties in British politics, they can wilfully overspend without any consequences.Mr Mackinlayrsquos election agent Nathan Gray, , from Hawkhurst, Kent, was earlier acquitted of making a  election expenses declaration.Nathan Gray The court heard the South Thanet constituency in Kent was considered a key seat in the  general election as the Conservatives fought against the increasingly popular Ukip.Mr Mackinlay won in  with a majority of around , from an electorate of , and was re-elected to Parliament in  just a week after he was charged.The prosecution case centred around claims that hotel costs and other expenditure for activists and party workers were recorded as national election spending rather than local, to ensure that strict spending limits for inidual candidates were not breached.During the campaign, South Thanet was visited by a number of high-profile Tory figures, including Theresa May, George Osborne, Boris Johnson and former footballer Sol Campbell.Declared spending came in under the pound, limit set for the constituency, but prosecutors claimed more than pound, was not declared.Mr Mackinlay, from Ramsgate, told jurors his aides had been cautious over the election budget, fearing a challenge by Mr Farage.ldquoOf any seat in the country, this would be the one looked at and pored over very carefully, he said.He insisted he had little control over spending and described a ldquobattle bus of volunteers drafted in by Conservative Party HQ as a ldquototal waste of time.ldquoI was just a small cog in a big gearbox, he added.Little, , of Ware in Hertfordshire was found guilty of two counts of intentionally encouraging or assisting an offence under the Serious Crime Act  but cleared of a third count..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Tory MP Craig Mackinlay cleared of falsying election expenses article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,Comments are closed on this article.Contact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They are in contact with the company to have it muted ASAP!” said Carla with the hashtags #depressing #santaisnotcomingtotown.A spokesperson for the council said soon after that they can confirm the music will be switched off that day.It caused uproar on social media with some agreeing with the MLA and others furious that she had little to do.However, veteran councillor Arnold Hatch believes she was out of touch with the community and business.Cllr Hatch, who is involved with Portadown Chamber of Commerce, asked: “What authority had Carla Lockhart to ask the Council to switch of the Christmas music two days before the contract ended “I think it is preposterous from someone who is not a councillor or a Director of ABC council to demand such action,” Alderman Hatch said.“I will be demanding answers from Council officials when theyto work on Monday.“I understand the complaint came from Lurgan, yet the music in Portadown was turned off too,” said Alderman Hatch.

This included piped music in Lurgan and Portadown which was to finish on  th January .“I want to know how many complaints there were, who took note of the complaint and who authorised the music to cease.“I certainly received no complaints from Portadown Chamber of Commerce. In fact, many agreed it helped to create a Festive atmosphere in the run up to Christmas and through to the January sales,” Ald Hatch said.Asked for a response Ms Lockhart said: “I think he will findhe speaks with businesses and people who live in the town centre he will get a very strong feel for the frustration caused by the music playing from early morning to pm at night one week after Christmas. Music was not the issue but the choice and I would have thought Council would have adopted the music repertoire after Christmas. “Mr Hatch has known me for a long time and can call me at any stage to discuss how elected reps conduct themselves. In his investigations he will find that the Lurgan Mail used the word ‘demand’ and I simply asked would Council consider turning the music off given that businesses and residents were frustrated.They informed me that they too had received calls in relation to it and they then obliged,” she claimed.try catch            ..

This is good for them and this is good for both colleges.“But what about the other % who do not, in particular what about those who are the most educationally vulnerable in the Lurgan area, why should their future be decided by those who go to Portadown schools or who are likely to be selected for one of the colleges.“The Education Authorityhave been working toward a solution and as part of that solution a number of options have been identied.“One of those options is for the children in Lurgan to stay in Lurgan and for the Lurgan Junior High Schools to become an – school with academic selection still taking place allowing children to go to the Lurgan College at . “However, this option is being discounted because of the words of the last Education Minister in June  where he made it clear that the Dickson Plan would not be removed ‘either directly or undermined through stealth’.“Yet it is clear that the Dickson plan is not being undermined and that selection will still take place at  with the option to go to Lurgan College at that time.

The adding of this statement will do nothing but reignite the bitter dispute around the Dickson Plan when there is no need to do so. It will feed into the fear of those parents and communities throughout the area who feel there is an attack on the Dickson Plan.“In itself it will create a negative response and fear that schools in Portadown will somehow be affected by a plan for Lurgan that puts Lurgan pupils and the Lurgan community at its heart.“I have been absolutely clear onwhere I stand on this issue. The children in Lurgan cannot stay at the Lurgan Campus site on Kitchen Hill, it is simply not fit for purpose, while bussing them to Portadown to a consolidated CSHS would be detrimental to the children and the wider Lurgan community.“Therefore creating an educational hub in Lurgan on the site of the Lurgan Junior High School through the provisions of - education would enhance education in the area while at the same time retaining the guidelines of the Dickson Plan with no detrimental effect on post primary schools and education in the wider Lurgan, Portadown and Tandragee area.“I am now calling on all elected representatives from all political parties in the area, civic leaders and educationalists to get behind a proposal for Lurgan Junior High School to become an - school with academic selection remaining at . I’m asking for parents from Portadown, Lurgan and Tandragee whose child is likely to go to one of the colleges or to the Portadown Campus of CSHS to support a Lurgan solution and I am asking the Board of Governors, teachers and Principals of Tandragee Junior High School, Clounagh Junior High School and Killicomaine Junior High School to support this bespoke solution for Lurgan and finally allow stability for those children and the community of Lurgan who have been badly forgotten over the last  years to finally have a sustainable post primary educational pathway.”An Education Authorityspokesperson said: “Craigavon Senior High School currently provides vitally important post-primary education services to the Craigavon area and currently operates across two campuses. “EA is undertaking consultation on how future provision at Craigavon Senior High School will be shaped. The purpose of this consultation is to seek the views of those most directly involved at a local level and will begin on Monday,  January, . “The consultation events will provide an opportunity to explore all of the facts and discuss the issues which will help shape future provision at Craigavon Senior High School for many years to come. “A letter inviting parents, staff and governors to participate in consultation events was issued on Monday,  January, .

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
