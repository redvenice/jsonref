Netanyahu has tried to portray himself as a statesman who is uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging timesThe performances of these parties could make or break Netanyahu\u0027s ability to form a coalition. Heavier turnout by Arab voters, many of whom stayed home in April, could also hurt Netanyahu.The Israeli leader is desperate to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies who are expected to approve legislation that would grant the prime minister immunity from prosecution.Israel\u0027s attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled next month.With his career on the line, Netanyahu has campaigned furiously and taken a late hard turn to the right in hopes of rallying his nationalist base.On Monday, Netanyahu vowed to annex \u0027all the settlements\u0027 in the West Bank in an attempt to win nationalist support ahead of the election.

He is the photographic artist of our time, whether capturing the frenzied activity of the Chicago stock exchange or a painterly vista of the Rhine – a manipulated landscape that does not exist in real life.

In 2000, she advertised online – using a brutal, shaven-headed and naked photograph of herself – for a husband with an EU Passport. Eventually she met and married a German in a performance in Belgrade. With him, she moved to Düsseldorf. Later, the couple celebrated their orce. A prescient exploration of how human transactions are conducted online, and using EU law as an artistic medium. ASLit only by the flickering light of a television programme about US navy seals deployed in Aghanistan, McQueen thrashes on his hotel bed, illuminated by violence, the soundtrack erupting with noise. His camera, on top of the telly, watches him struggling in the gloom. Little more than a filmed sketch, a situation grasped, Illuminer nevertheless has everything, and is a lesson in being able to make work anywhere, anytime. ASHumans have made pictures for millennia – why get hung up on how they are made? So asks Wolfgang Tillmans. Soon after becoming the first photographer to win the Turner prize in 2000, Tillmans started experimenting with picture-making that skipped camera, negative and subject, produced by exposing photographic paper to handheld light sources in the darkroom. The Freischwimmer series has a cool liquid quality: vast prints apparently depicting tiny dots of coloured liquid tumbling and trailing through water. In fact they are images of nothing more than their own production: oddly honest for an age in which you can seldom trust your eyes.

An exercise in power, this work is as much sculptural as it is a performance, or an equestrian ballet. The smell of the horses, their scale in a contained space, the often unspoken marshalling, the uncertainty of whether you are audience or subject: the Cuban artist regards this 2008 performance as a vignette, but it is so much more.

This prince, well versed in new philosophies, set aside painting and video art and decreed the exhibition a social laboratory. One thousand and one citizens of China would travel by his side as both audience and exhibit. And the prince constructed a great dormitory, matching wheelie suitcases and coloured bracelets, that by these tokens the citizens of Kassel might know the citizens of China, and welcome them. And all lived happily ever after (apart from the Prince of Protest, who was arrested four years later and imprisoned for 81 days by his own government). HJThis cycle of 14 paintings, all based on an Andy Warhol sketch of a monkey, and assembled in a specially constructed and lit room in collaboration with architect David Atjaye, was a breakthrough work for Chris Ofili. Tate’s purchase of the work proved controversial, but it would probably have been split up otherwise. With its drifts of glitter, its gorgeous colour and detail, its humour and elephant dung, it pointed the way to an expansive, immersive narrative approach Ofili has continued to develop. I was astonished. ASStarting with the basic, pressing question of how to evade surveillance in a world read through moving images, Hito Steyerl’s influential video picks apart what it means to disappear. If surveillance feels grossly invasive, how do we feel about the invisibility afforded to the vastly wealthy? What about the invisibility bestowed by a burqa, systemic bigotry, or extraordinary rendition? Shot on an abandoned satellite “resolution target” in the California desert, How Not to Be Seen is conceptually intense, but retains the daffiness of the Monty Python sketch that inspired it. An artist and theorist both, Steyerl beguiles us into contemplating uncomfortable questions with wit and charm. HJRead more here.“This variation, 2012” says a voice in a pitch-black room. Tino Sehgal’s magnificent performance piece takes place in near total darkness. Performers stamp and sing, whisper, holler and dance. They go through little routines, songs and riffs as the viewer stumbles among and between them. Sometimes there is a confrontation and sometimes unnerving quiet. Wildly exhilarating, This Variation concerns presence and presentness, and what it means to be a spectator.

Birds sing, cars go by, people fold washing as she tramps back alleys and country lanes, city streets and unmade paths. Nothing happens in the film. It has already happened, in bucolic villages and city side-streets. The film lasts a long time, dwelling on the past’s persistence in the present. The camera is unwavering as the world turns, oblivious. ASRead more here.A moving, beautiful, mournful and uplifting three-channel portrait of the lives and times of Stuart Hall.

Eliasson’s hallucinatory installation in the Tate Turbine Hall had people lying on the floor, mellowing out to his shimmering recreation of a Turneresque sky inside the museum. He would be very good at staging a Pink Floyd reunion. But in fact he is a very thoughtful artist, fascinated by colour, light and the fragile state of nature. This unforgettable spectacle was the most over-the-top in a string of dazzling installations and interventions that have proved Elisasson one of the century’s most significant artists.

The painting is as small as the TV screens people were glued to that day. The image is interrupted, almost swiped away by paint, recognising the impossibility of comprehending the enormity of the moment. ASTaking as its premise a call for more than three million Jews to return to Poland, land of their forefathers, to save the country from being only for “Polish Poles in Poland”, Yael Bartana’s film trilogy plays on and inverts nationalist sentiment, EU and old-style Communist party rhetoric, Zionist dreams, the holocaust and the Palestinian right to return. With escalating irony, shock and pithy humour, Bartana takes on the world. ASRead the review.Having been cut into the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall, the Colombian artist’s 2007 work is still partly visible in the concrete, like an old scar. It zigzagged down the ramp like a small canyon, or the remains of an earthquake. Shibboleth evoked ision, a flaw. “It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred,” Salcedo said. “The space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.” How of our moment Shibboleth remains.

Using puppets – some extremely old, many made in clay or Murano glass – Shawky delights, ravishes and informs at every turn. It is hard to keep up with all the shenanigans between Shia and Sunni, and the duplicitous isions and squabbles of the Christian invaders, regarded by Arab commentators of the time as uncivilised barbarians.

But few will have seen the entire work, with its approximately 12,000 cinema clips ning its 24-hour entirety. A tour-de-force of borrowed movie footage, The Clock is cinema’s great timepiece, always synchronised to the real time wherever it is shown. Following the diurnal rhythms of everyday life, it is by turns perky, sexy, conspiratorial, manic, exhausted and sullen. Knowing it is there is almost enough.

Teresa Margolles’s Limpieza (Cleaning), part of her larger work at the Mexico Pavilion at the 2009 Venice Biennale, was both an everyday routine and a bleak response to both state and criminal violence. Both washing and sullying the floors, Limpieza was emphatic, unforgettable, tragic and tender. ASThere’s a lot of weak political art out there: sophisticated, modish, after-the-factish art that broadcasts liberal values to a liberal audience. Pussy Riot’s performance of Punk Prayer occupies the opposite pole: feminist, explicitly anti-Putin, protesting the banning of gay pride and the Orthodox church’s support of the president. Staged by the brightly masked punk collective in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, it got members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina arrested and imprisoned. The after-image of their performance still lingers as a powerful – and immaculately constructed – symbol of defiance in the face of freedoms lost.

Among great stands of nettles, strange plants of all descriptions flourished: nightshade and Afghan poppies, aphrodisiacs, poisons and psychotropic plants. In a clearing beside a pond sat a bronze statue of a reclining woman whose head was a living nest of bees. Two lithe greyhounds, one of whom had a leg that had been dyed pink, wandered about. “Live things and inanimate things, made and not made,” read Huyghe’s description of this wondrous work. ASHistory isn’t only written by the winners – it is also woven into magnificent battle tapestries for their baronial walls, and painted large and heroic on canvas for their palaces. In portraying a brutal clash between pickets and police in South Yorkshire during the miners’ strikes in 1984-5, Deller instead chose to approach this horrifying confrontation from the field up. Battle of Orgreave, described by the artist as “a thousand-person crime re-enactment”, was staged by 800 historical re-enacters and 200 former miners. For all of them, the event was in living memory. A monument of sorts, the performance was at once participatory ritual, spectacle, living archive and a space to mourn.

Ragnar understood her lyrics as a commentary on what he calls the “common defeat” of their marriage. The music was co-written by Kjartansson and his frequent collaborator Davíð Þór Jónsson.The artist’s friends play different parts of the same song, which repeats over and over, for more than an hour. A pair of twins play concertina and cello in different rooms – all the musicians were audible to one another through headphones. There are two pianists, a guitarist, drums. The Visitors is a live performance, each musician visible on a different screen. Outside, there is a party on the porch, where the house’s current occupants take in the early evening. Captured in real time, one evening at sunset, the music builds and dies and builds again. The song repeats and develops, reaches false crescendos and plateaus. Ragnar, in the bath, is nearly submerged in soap bubbles as he sings, “Once again I’m falling into my feminine ways.” “There are stars exploding around you  And there is nothing  Nothing you can do,” goes another refrain, in this idyllic crumbling retreat. You get sucked in.You feel like a guest yourself in this marvellous, immersive multiscreen film. The more often I see it, the more I come to inhabit its rooms. Why is it so compelling and, with its repetitions, so watchable multiple times? The fragility of friendship and love, communality and miscommunication all have a part here. The title of the work is taken from Abba’s final album, when the band were falling apart. The film’s absurdities and longeurs, the light, and the concentration of all the performers and the repetition of the song is utterly compelling and hypnotic. Youthfulness and idealism feel like a fading dream in the evening’s light. The Visitors is a kind of extended farewell to romanticism, to which Ragnar is both drawn and deeply suspicious of. Writing this, I want to see The Visitors again, immediately.

Bourne’s study of this copy, which has been housed in the Free Library of Philadelphia since 1944, dated the annotator to the mid-17th century, finding them alive to “the sense, accuracy, and interpretative possibility of the dialogue”. She also provided many images of the handwritten notes, which struck Scott-Warren as looking oddly similar to Milton’s hand.“But I always think ‘I recognise that handwriting,’” Scott-Warren said. “I go and check and normally I’m wrong. This time I thought: ‘The case is getting stronger and stronger’.”As evidence stacked up, he said he became “quite trembly … You’re gathering evidence with your heart in your mouth.”The first folio is the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, published seven years after his death. Without it, 18 plays including Macbeth and The Tempest might have been lost to history. Around 750 first folios were printed, with 233 known to survive. They command huge sums at auction, with one selling for £1.87m three years ago.Scott-Warren has made a detailed comparison of the annotator’s handwriting with the Paradise Lost poet’s. He also believes that the work the annotator did to improve the text of the folio – suggesting corrections and supplying additional material such as the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, along with cross-references to other works – is similar to work Milton did in other books that survive from his library, including his copy of Boccaccio’s Life of Dante.The scholar tentatively suggested in a blogpost that he might have identified John Milton’s copy of the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, admitting that, “in this as in other cases, there’s usually a lot of wishful thinking, plus copious spinning of the evidence to make it seem plausible, and elision of anything that doesn’t seem to fit”.But he soon found that other scholars were agreeing with him. “Not only does this hand look like Milton’s, but it behaves like Milton’s writing elsewhere does, doing exactly the things Milton does when he annotates books, and using exactly the same marks,” said Dr Will Poole at New College Oxford. “Shakespeare is our most famous writer, and the poet John Milton was his most famous younger contemporary. It was, until a few days ago, simply too much to hope that Milton’s own copy of Shakespeare might have survived — and yet the evidence here so far is persuasive. This may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times.”As well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator’s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton’s own work.“The book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you’re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,” he said. “It’s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton’s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don’t give you any verbal content, you don’t know why he’s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton’s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.”One highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: “Come unto these yellow sands,  And then take hands:  Courtsied when you have and kiss’d  The wild waves whist.” The unusual rhyme, of “kiss’d” and “whist”, is echoed in Milton’s On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity: “The winds with wonder whist,  Smoothly the waters kist.”“We would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,” said Scott-Warren. “It gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What’s quite remarkable as well is that he’s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous – he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.”It has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton – in his poem On Shakespeare, Milton calls him a “son of Memory” and “great heir of fame”, writing of how “Thou in our wonder and astonishment  Hast built thyself a live-long monument.”“But this allows us to see the encounter happening,” said Scott-Warren. “It shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don’t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that’s really exciting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1829debc1a8216f9bbf100c1e4ab302e89a33f61/131_308_937_562/master/937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3066962d0ed39f485b6044d14764e768","title":"isadora duncan review avant garde dancer biography julie birmant  clement oubrerie","story":"In the public imagination, the avant garde dancer Isadora Duncan often appears as a somewhat ridiculous figure: a tunic-wearing, self-taught dervish whose art could be almost as vulgar as it was glorious. If her death at the age of 50, when her trailing scarf became caught in the wheels of the car in which she was travelling, still seems sad and wasteful, there’s also, at this distance, something blackly comical about it: the hand-painted, floating ribbon of silk that killed her speaks of an exuberance that was never practical, and only very rarely wise.In their clever, episodic retelling of Duncan’s life, the writer Julie Birmant and the cartoonist Clément Oubrerie (Aya: Life in Yop City), occasionally touch on this idealistic silliness. When, for instance, she decides to live with her brother on a barren Greek hillside – devoted to all things Attic, they intend to spend their days spinning wool, milking goats and building a replica of Agamemnon’s temple – it isn’t long before she’s complaining that her replica bed is on the hard side (in the end, she’s saved by Wagner’s widow, Cosima, who invites her to Bayreuth to direct the ballet in Tannhäuser). But nor are they too inclined overly to revere her as the mother of modern dance. By their telling, the key to her genius lies with her times, for if she sometimes goes one step beyond what appears to her contemporaries to be sane or decent, it’s not only because she is wild. There is also the question of equality. All she wants is the right to express herself as loudly and as eloquently as any man.What a life, though. In Isadora, Birmant and Oubrerie squeeze so much in, from her arrival in London from the US in 1899 to her death in the south of France in 1927. Here, off stage, is the terrible loss of her children, Deirdre and Patrick, in 1913 (they drowned while in the care of their nanny) and here, fully on stage, is her brief and disastrous marriage to the Russian poet Sergei Yesenin (a raging alcoholic 18 years her junior, he killed himself in 1925). We see her meet Rodin in Paris, an encounter that was an artistic turning point, and we watch as she performs in Berlin in 1902, wrapped in a theatre curtain she has torn down with her bare hands.It’s sometimes hard to remember, as she criss-crosses Europe, drinking vodka with Maxim Gorky and smiling at Camille Saint-Saëns as he kisses her hand, that she grew up in a poor family in Oakland, California, and dropped out of school aged 10. But when you do (remember, I mean), you only admire her all the more. What energy, and what spirit. With her planet-sized eyes and heart-shaped face, her muscled thighs and disobedient hair, Oubrerie has made her seem, on the page, so incredibly alive. To pinch from Dorothy Parker, whatever else you might say about her, this was a woman for whom there was never going to be a place in the ranks of the terrible, slow army of the cautious.• Isadora by Julie Birmant and Clément Oubrerie is published by SelfMadeHero (£14.99).

Its charming old town, array of Unesco World Heritage sites and sizeable port were always draws, but the new success of Game of Thrones, much of which was shot in the Croatian city, has made it a particularly popular stopoff point for cruise ships, whose passengers are told they can see the highlights in a single day.Smaller boats or tenders take the passengers on to dry land, where they are typically bussed into the old town. Tours often start at the 16th-century Pile Gate, followed by a stroll along the Stradun to the city walls, entrance to which costs €30 (£27). Game of Thrones locations and Europe’s oldest pharmacy in a 14th-century Franciscan monastery are big pulls.There is increasingly troubling evidence, however, of the dramatic effect the guests are having, not least on the kind of city Dubrovnik will be. Where once there were bookshops, bakeries, butchers, hair salons and markets, tacky souvenir shops and stalls now cater to the tourists. The boats themselves also burn huge amounts of fossil fuel, creating water, air and noise pollution, and severely affect the marine ecosystem.A growing sense among city residents that tourism has become overtourism has caused the mayor to introduce tighter controls: during mornings just two ships can dock, with a third after midday. Next year a limit of 4,000 daily visitors will be allowed ashore, and in two years each will face a €2 tax.Another proposal is for ships – which tend to leave their motors running so that fridges, air conditioning and other technical functions continue to operate – to be forced to draw their energy supplies from the Croatian mainland instead. The mayor’s argument is that the city should at least benefit financially from the presence of the ships, though environmentalists note that the stipulation won’t stop the ships from running the motors or address the ecological damage. Nor is there any detail about how these measures will be applied, or how to ensure cruise ship operators abide by the rules.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Montenegro, another small city is facing a similar problem to Dubrovnik but is even more vulnerable. About two and a half hours along the coast, the tiny city of Kotor often has three huge ships docked in port, each staying for an average of 12 hours. The third most popular cruise ship destination in the Adriatic, Kotor expects a total of 500 cruise ships in 2019, bringing more than half a million people. “Compare this to 2003 when there were just 50 ships and 50,000 people,” says Vesna Mačič from Kotor’s institute of Marine Biology.Kotor is even more at risk than Dubrovnik because Montenegro is outside the EU, so EU laws don’t apply. The city has no recognised marine reserves, ships can use cheaper oil containing sulphur, and there are no restrictions on noise, which is known to damage organisms such as fish, dolphins and turtles.Kotor’s location – at the end of the Boka Kotorska bay, which is surrounded by large mountains – means gases emitted by cruise ships linger for longer, damaging local air quality. Fishermen and marine biologists also complain that the ships drag along the bottom of the bay, damaging the ecosystem, and that they discharge waste water, thus releasing foreign matter into the bay and further upsetting the natural balance. Flowering sea grass, clams and the rich seabed flora are said to have suffered as a result.“The biggest issue is due to the huge size of the cruisers, meaning only one can be directly attached to the port at one time, and the other two or three on any given day have to be anchored further away,” Mačič says.“This creates huge physical damage to organisms – sponges, coral, sea stars and others – inhabiting the muddy sea floor. On top of that you have the constant lifting and lowering of anchors and the movements of the ships, which affects light distribution and therefore the ability of plants to perform photosynthesis, endangering various types of algae and seaweed.” She wants to see cheap oil banned in line with EU legislation, the number of ships limited, buoys used instead of anchors, and tugboats turning the ships around.In a country where the average salary is around €453 a month, however, there is little appetite for any major restrictions on tourists, who spend an average of around €40 a day. In Kotor, at least, most locals are resigned to the idea that the cruise ships are unlikely to go away.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d14759d16ef8e2038335cccb4478b47e7b744b/0_174_2606_1563/master/2606.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e8c828093b9f31005885c98fa0d425a","title":"wework delays ipo investors flotation","story":"Office-sharing company’s value has been slashed since January but it says flotation will still take place this year WeWork, the US office-sharing company, has postponed its stock market flotation after receiving a lukewarm response from investors.WeWork’s parent, the We Company, had planned to launch an investor roadshow this week to drum up interest in its $20bn (£16bn) share sale, slashed from an initial valuation of $47bn. It hoped to price and list its shares next week, but has put the plans on ice amid operating losses and corporate governance issues.The We Company said it still aimed to complete the flotation before the end of the year.The company has been under pressure to push ahead with the flotation to secure funding for its operations. We Company secured a $6bn credit line from banks last month but can only access this if WeWork floats before the end of the year and raises at least $3bn.We Company reportedly realised on Monday that even with the support of WeWork’s biggest backer, Softbank, the IPO would have raised just more than $2bn, short of this target.Softbank, the Japanese telecoms and technology group, had urged the company to delay the float, after concerns mounted over big operating losses, pricey lease agreements and executive payouts. A recently released prospectus showed the company has lost about $3bn over the past three years.WeWork’s IPO underwriters at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have been testing investor appetite for shares with a valuation between $15bn and $20bn. The valuation could be as low as $10bn, according to reports.John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School and an expert on IPOs, said: “Following the recent collapse of Uber and Lyft shares after their initial price offerings, potential investors in WeWork will have some valid questions. How much is it really worth behind the slick marketing? And will it be successful in the long run?”He noted that the company is a long way from becoming profitable, and lost $1.9bn after making sales of $1.8bn last year. It has been losing $2 for every $1 of revenue it generates.“It is also relatively easy for new competitors to enter the market, perhaps in less costly parts of the city and because WeWork offers short-term contracts, it is easy for tenants to move elsewhere if a better deal comes along. There are no strong reasons to be loyal to WeWork,” Colley said.“WeWork is highly subsidised to attract its customers. This means the company will probably have to raise prices in the future to make money, particularly when investors want a return. Any collapse in demand will see them struggle to pay their landlords, particularly during an economic downturn or recession.”There are also concerns about the firm’s management and corporate governance standards. WeWork’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, has taken $700m out of the company before the IPO. He also owns properties that WeWork rents, a potential conflict of interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84e9ec55498d5979574555b92875609b051bda9b/0_2156_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6a6fb44cd82ae7c7a5679bc52ad84c5","title":"the guardian view on a liberal democrat revoke a promise that wont be redeemed","story":"Ms Swinson’s wager appears to be that she is right and the punters are wrong. In the Brexit referendum there was a tendency to underestimate the appeal of leave, and the Lib Dems think Westminster is now ignoring the latent remain vote. It is true that a petition supporting the revocation of article 50, which would stop Brexit in its tracks, attracted more than 6m signatures. It is also the case that Brexit is likely to feature as a big issue in the next general election, and the Lib Dems see an advantage in carving a niche out of make-it-stop politics.The winner-takes-all mentality behind Ms Swinson’s policy is troubling. The lack of a democratic mandate for revoke means it could entrench a permanent ide in British life that will be impossible to bridge. Politicians ought to think about their policy’s consequences. If the Lib Dems’ idea is accepted, then why couldn’t the SNP be permitted to hold a second independence vote if it won the next Holyrood election? Then there are the accusations of inconsistency. In 2008 Ms Swinson wanted a referendum on EU membership. Two years later she campaigned on a manifesto that committed the Lib Dems to an inout EU referendum. She was a minister in an austerity government that did so much to create the pain and ision behind the leave howl. In 2016 an EU referendum took place. The country voted out. Three years later, Ms Swinson won’t accept the outcome of a plebiscite she had said she wanted.The Lib Dems are positioning themselves to tap future popular revulsion against the major parties. Yet the politics of protest only works if there is something to protest about. If Boris Johnson strikes a Brexit deal with the EU, where does this leave Ms Swinson? The Lib Dem policy also gives Labour a clear run at a second referendum. Ms Swinson’s offer is just to permanently polarise the electorate around Brexit. The Lib Dems still have no distinctive pitch for issues beyond leaving the EU. This is the party of ideas, home to Keynes and Beveridge. But there’s no sign of a middle way being plotted by the party between the extremes. Unless Ms Swinson can do so, the odds will be stacked against the Lib Dems in a general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b0b4c66b19d797fda54500bfdc84f127f5e9e3e/0_220_3501_2102/master/3501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68cc18e92529c99f9cb4d3b5d7d0e61f","title":"palestinians israel election occupation netanyahu","story":"After 50 years of occupation, our freedom is shrinking every day. But even if Netanyahu loses, little will changeWhen Boris Johnson announced his plan to suspend parliament, I was visiting Orkney with my wife, Penny. It was the last week of a month-long stay in Scotland, and it took a day for the news to reach us. We were having tea with some English friends on 29 August when they heard what had happened. They began to fume: he’s done it again. They worried how this would undermine their country’s democracy. It was a curious twist: I am usually the one bearing bad news about the state of my country. For a brief moment, we traded anxieties – although mine were of a more existential nature. Even in Scotland, the bad news from home was constant: the expansion of Israeli settlements, the threat of annexation, and the steady tally of death and injury in Gaza, all eating away at what remained of my Palestine.A few days later, just after Johnson had expelled 21 MPs from his party, we flew home. The driver who picked us up from the airport took the usual circuitous route to get us to Ramallah, crossing three checkpoints on the way. At each one, we held our breath and hoped the soldiers were not in a bad mood. As always I felt the shock of returning home, seeing our parched hills at the end of summer and my noisy, crowded city I had a sudden and pervasive sense of precariousness.On the way our driver informed us without betraying any emotion that Israel was no longer allowing traffic from Jerusalem to pass through the notorious checkpoint at Qalandia into the West Bank, forcing drivers on to circuitous routes through other checkpoints and compounding the misery there. “They are digging and placing cables” on the road to the checkpoint, he said. Then with typical sardonic Palestinian humour he added: “Perhaps they are planning to present us with a gift.”His other news was about Benjamin Netanyahu’s triumphant stroll through the old city of Hebron, where he spoke in front of the Ibrahimi mosque, a holy site for Muslims and Jews, who know it as the Tomb of the Patriarchs. In 2000, Ariel Sharon’s provocative visit to al-Aqsa mosque sparked a second intifada. But this time Palestinian protest was muted. Some signs were held aloft and a murmur of anger was heard.Netanyahu acted triumphant. He assured the 800 Jewish settlers who dominate a city of more than 200,000 Palestinians that they will “remain here for ever”. By paying his first visit since 1998 to the most populated Palestinian city in the West Bank – without setting off a strong protest – the Israeli prime minister was highlighting his almost total control of the territory. It was a transparent stunt to boost his popularity before the upcoming elections. But it did demonstrate how thoroughly Israel has dominated and subdued the Palestinian population under its occupation.Every time I return to Ramallah after a few weeks away, I’m struck by how much my world has shrunk. Movement between Palestinian cities is restricted, and travel to Gaza impossible. Gaza is about 50 miles away from Ramallah I have not visited for 19 years. The Oslo accords ided Palestinian territory into three categories. “Area C” is under Israeli control, “Area B” is under joint security control by Israel and the Palestinians, and “Area A” – the smallest – is administered by the Palestinian authority.Since Donald Trump became US president, the Israeli settlers in the West Bank have hastened their takeover of more and more Palestinian territory in the areas under Israeli administration – including the land around Ramallah. No longer do the settlers justify this by the law of the land as Israel interprets it, nor by Israeli court decisions. It is now simply the Bible. They declare: “This land is ours even if the Palestinian can present proof of ownership, because God gave it to us.”Ramallah is now the de facto capital of the struggling Palestinian Authority. It suffers from overcrowding but enjoys none of the benefits of statehood. A few days before our return, the head of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, declared that it would cancel the ision of the land into three “areas” and put the whole West Bank under PA sovereignty. But this was a hollow declaration, and the PA will be forbidden from implementing it. In July, Israel demolished dozens of Palestinian apartments in an East Jerusalem neighbourhood where the PA is supposed to control planning – and the authority was powerless to stop it.Last week Netanyahu promised that if re-elected he would annex one-third of the West Bank, including the Jordan Valley, the West Bank’s most fertile area. This was another election stunt: in reality, annexing the land will change nothing. It is already under total Israeli control, and the settlers who live there enjoy all the rights and privileges of Israeli citizenship.I’ve returned carrying a large number of books because ordering one takes many months – if it ever arrives. But it isn’t only books that are delayed. The mail that has to go through Israel is barely functioning. Living conditions in my hometown under Israeli occupation are going from bad to worse with the economic exploitation by Israel proceeding unchallenged. Most vegetables and fruits that we used to buy from local greengrocers were local produce. Now they are mainly Israeli and often are grown on Palestinian land that the settlements now cultivate.Among Palestinians, despair is widespread. “The times are rotten,” my nephew Aziz told me upon my return, echoing Hamlet. There is growing awareness here that Israel’s international campaign to demonise criticism of its colonial policies as a form of antisemitism is succeeding. And there is no hope to be found in Israel: none of the parties contesting the elections on Tuesday are talking about the occupation or proposing how to end it. Instead they are competing to see who can promise the most to the settlers.This is the gloomy political atmosphere to which I have returned. I shall miss the walks in Edinburgh’s parks and the green hills around it. I had hoped that we could spare one of the hills around Ramallah and turn it into a park. But given the scarcity of the land left here to grow, this proved impossible. This congested city is left with no open areas to breathe, and with few of its traditional buildings and trees that gave the place its character.After a month away, I found my garden had lost much of its greenery except for the plumbago – which I found in full bloom. I will revive what can be saved, and in the future concentrate on planting only drought-resistant shrubs. And I must try to remember what I have learned during more than 50 years of occupation, about how to live here on my own terms without losing myself to hatred or anger. For whoever gets elected in Israel this week, it will make no difference to our future in this land.• Raja Shehadeh is a Palestinian writer and lawyer.

But the honest study of history is not about making you feel good. Take the case of the second world war and how, 80 years after the invasion of Poland, a dispute in Gdańsk over a museum about the war is playing out.The populists in Poland’s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party have meddled so much in redrafting the narrative conveyed both by the museum and its main exhibition that four Polish historians involved with the institution’s creation and launch have been left with little choice but to go to court.The courts are hardly the best place to adjudicate on the lessons of history. Universities, academies, libraries and museums are surely more suited to such debates. So let me explain how things got to this point.The Gdańsk Museum of the Second World War opened in 2017 to some fanfare its distinguishing and unconventional features were to be its special focus both on the global context of the war and on the fate of civilians in the bloody conflict. The main exhibition took eight years to put together. The American historian Timothy Snyder called the project a “civilisational achievement” and “perhaps the most ambitious museum devoted to the second world war in any country”.But the populists who had come to power in Poland’s elections two years earlier found this unbearable, preferring to promote a version of events that would airbrush real history and glorify the nation instead. Soon enough the minister of culture and national heritage, Piotr Gliński, dismissed the Gdańsk museum director, Paweł Machcewicz . A new director, Karol Nawrocki, was duly installed who set about altering the main exhibition – without consulting its authors. The revised approach was to tack closely to government guidelines giving emphasis to a glorification of Polish military actions and to cast Poland as a righteous nation: the museum would be a monument to national martyrology.Nawrocki, for example, replaced a filmed summary of civilians’ experiences in the war with another film altogether, in which the soundtrack includes claims that can only be described as propaganda, with phrases such as: “we saved Jews” “we give life in the name of dignity and freedom” “we were betrayed” “the pope gave hope of victory” “communists lose” “we won” and “we do not beg for freedom, we fight for it”. This is populist history. Populist historians tell people – especially those who have voted for them – what they want to hear about the past. Remembering the war is a zero-sum game to them: it’s about winners and losers. They care little about the complexities and even less about acknowledging dark chapters of Poland’s collective past. What have we really learned from the past? Old photos of a completely destroyed Warsaw reminded me of news images of other cities, such as Aleppo, that have in more recent times experienced the full brutality of a military onslaught. All the more reason to be reminded of what went before us and of those caught up in the horror.But for populist historians – and not only in Poland – history is not about learning lessons it is either a plaything to salve national complexes or a weapon to use in foreign policy (for example, in Polish-Ukrainian or Polish-Israeli relations).Machcewicz along with the museum’s other founding historians, Janusz Marszalec, Rafał Wnuk and Piotr M Majewski, responded to all this with a loud “no”. They have sued the new director of the museum over the infringement of their copyright for the exhibition’s content and managed to halt other changes to the museum. I totally agree with Machcewicz, who describes this saga as “Poland’s most important dispute about history in years”.The case, which the courts have yet to rule on, is the first of its kind in Poland and probably in Europe. I can’t think of another example of an exhibition mounted by a major museum being censored by a government because it pays too much attention to civilians and because it insufficiently glorifies the nation. It feels more like the standards that would be applied in Putin’s Russia than in a democratic member state of the European Union.The late Leszek Kołakowski, one of Poland’s greatest philosophers, wrote in his essay, Doctor Faustus: “We learn about the past to know how to recognise around us those faces touched by its worst legacy.” To me, a young Pole, this surely is the best definition of the point of studying history. It will hardly surprise you that communist censors didn’t let Kołakowski publish those words. And now, 30 years after the communist regime collapsed in Poland, history is again being manipulated for political motives. It’s as if only one version – that approved by a rightwing government that has overseen countless acts of democratic backsliding and is seeking re-election next month – is acceptable. Anyone who sees things differently is deemed a public enemy.When I started looking into the Gdańsk museum dispute as a news story, it felt like a good issue to report – especially as I had studied history at university and am passionate about it. But gradually it became something more deeply personal I realised that this was about our collective values. And it should be personal for anyone who cares about pluralism and free debate. This is a battle to safeguard history that’s not written in black and white, nor aimed at serving a political agenda, but history that inspires us to make connections between the past and today’s world. Big words, you might say. But those four historians who are taking on the government have picked a fight that goes far beyond the future of one museum. This has a European meaning. It concerns us all.• Estera Flieger is a journalist with Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509b59b2a2d27f483ebd41dcbef1f7b6dc5f5693/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddf8e55a9e369cae48347eb2f312afdf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of market","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘market’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘market’.Share your photos of what market means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 September at 10am.

No sooner has the autumn term begun than schools are recruiting the next cohort of students. If it sometimes seems that they all say the same things about their engaging curriculum, personalised pastoral care and professional ethos, how can you tell them apart?For some parents, it’s all about outcomes. Which school tops the league table for results? Which has been judged by Ofsted as outstanding? For others, it’s more about a culture that will suit their child. Is there a mobile phone ban? Does the school have the dreaded isolation booths?But there is also another consideration. In the same way that consumers are becoming more ethically driven when it comes to the working conditions of those making their clothes or harvesting their food, some are now wondering about how their child’s teachers are treated. So how can you tell whether a school is “toxic”?Just to reassure you, there are not many toxic schools out there. However, it is undeniable that a few have an ethos where staff are worked to the bone, made to complete unnecessary tasks, and are not treated with respect.Miserable and exhausted teachers are unlikely to be as effective as they could be. Teaching is tough but not every school seeks to improve conditions for staff. I wouldn’t want my children taught in such an environment, even if whipping their teachers leads to better GCSEs.I’ve known victims of toxic schools. If I could handpick a teacher for my children it would be my friend Sylvia every time. Sylvia ended up in a toxic school. Meetings were called for 7am as well as 7pm emails demanding immediate actions arrived at all hours, at weekends and during holidays. Her head of department came into her year 11 lesson and announced to the students that if they failed, it would be Sylvia she blamed. The principal never once spoke to her. When she spent hours putting up a beautiful display of student poetry, she was told she’d used the wrong colours and it had to be taken down immediately. Sylvia ended up having a breakdown and quit.It also happens to headteachers. When Rob’s mum died, within six hours of her death his chair of governors had emailed three times wanting to know when he’d be back and whether he could finish the report he was writing by the next day.By the time of his mum’s funeral a week later, the chair had phoned 17 times and sent 50 emails, not one offering condolences. It was the last straw after years in a toxic academy trust. Rob walked away from a school where he was dearly needed.Does this matter to you? And if it does, what are the signs?Look carefully when you visit. Are the senior leadership team visible? Are they talking to children and parents? Are they talking to teacher colleagues, or keeping to themselves in a huddle? How do the teachers interact with one another around the building – do they seem respectful, happy and positive? Don’t necessarily dismiss schools where teachers look tired – teachers are nearly always tired and the back-to-school bugs will have hit.I’ve heard that triple marking helps children. Do you do that here?Triple marking – or excessively remarking work – does not lead to better outcomes but is an indicator of excessive workload expectations.How often will I see marking in my child’s books? Although we are conditioned into thinking lots of marking will improve outcomes, it is not the case. Regular feedback, much of which is oral, makes a difference. Many schools trying to reduce workload and improve teacher wellbeing have ditched written marking altogether.How often will I find out how my child is doing? It is reasonable to expect updates a couple of times a year and one or two parents’ evenings any more is an indicator of excessive workload.Are there many new staff this year? Sometimes schools may need staff turnover to keep things fresh, and it is sometimes necessary to move on underperforming staff. However, a regular high turnover may indicate unhappy staff.What do you do on Inset days? This may provide an insight as to how valuable the staff find the professional development on offer. Are Inset days used to lecture them and berate them about results? Or do they get time simply to get themselves organised? With what kind of enthusiasm do they speak about their experiences?I work long hours so I might have to email you at about 8pm – when would you be able to respond? Don’t expect responses immediately – within 24 working hours is fine. Lots of schools are encouraging staff to remove work email from their devices and set time limits during evenings and weekends.What do you think about the head’s vision? Staff who feel involved in a shared mission tend to be happier. Teachers completely at odds with the direction of the school are unlikely to feel settled, involved and happy.How long have you worked here? Are you likely to stay for long? Whether a teacher has just joined or been employed for years, the way in which each inidual responds will give you an impression about whether they feel as if they belong and are looked after. The caveat is that even after 30 years of experience, I’m not sure I could walk through the door of a different school and be able to identify whether it was toxic or not. Adopting the air of a concerned but unknowledgable innocent can disarm those you speak to. Bear in mind, though, that even if their responses raise a red flag, the school may still be a happy place to work. You may never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f86e1d570f91a9494a487aedc7dff865a8bc8ce/0_236_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5ffafaf321421da5d6292ae081c68d5","title":"un climate summit 2019 why it matters","story":"With Trump expected to skip the UN climate summit, the question will be: what’s possible if the most powerful nation is pulling away from action?This story originally appeared in the Nation. It is republished here as part of the ’s partnership with Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.As world leaders converge on New York City for the United Nations climate action Summit on 23 September, they enter what may be the most consequential week in climate politics since Donald Trump’s surprise election as president of the United States in 2016. Trump, of course, announced soon after taking office that he was withdrawing the US from the Paris agreement, the landmark treaty signed at the last big UN climate summit in 2015. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, convened this week’s summit precisely because the US and most other countries remain far from honoring their Paris pledges to reduce heat-trapping emissions enough to prevent catastrophic climate disruption.The events of the coming days – including a global climate strike on 20 September by the activists whose protests in the past year have pushed the term “climate emergency” into news reports around the world – may help answer a question that has loomed over humanity since Trump’s election: can the rest of the world save itself from climate breakdown if the richest, most powerful nation on earth is pulling in the opposite direction?Adopted in December 2015, the Paris agreement stands as the strongest achievement of climate diplomacy since governments first debated the issue at the UN Earth Summit in 1992. In a shock to climate insiders, the agreement not only committed signatory governments to limit temperature rise to the relatively less dangerous level of 2C. It also obliged governments to keep temperature rise “well below” 2C and, in a major victory for the most vulnerable countries, to strive for 1.5C. That half-degree may not sound like much, but it spells the difference between life and death for low-lying coastal nations such as Bangladesh and island states such as the Males – two of many places that, science says, would literally disappear beneath the waves with more than 1.5C of warming.Trump is not expected to attend this week’s summit the US delegation will instead be led by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal company lobbyist who is now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. In keeping with Trump’s denial of climate science and his administration’s dismantling of environmental regulations and accelerating of fossil fuel development, Wheeler testified to the US Senate last January that he would not call climate change “the greatest crisis” facing humanity.Which highlights a question that may shape whether this summit turns out to be a success, a failure, or something in between. What role will the US play? Will it be a spoiler, actively seeking to disrupt progress? Will it be a braggart who, as Wheeler boasted (inaccurately) in that testimony, represents “the gold standard for environmental progress”? Or will it be more like the addled uncle at the family reunion whose babblings provoke eye-rolls and are ignored?“Don’t bring a speech, bring a plan!” For months now, that’s what Guterres has been telling heads of state and government. Instead of the endless blah-blah-blah heard at most UN meetings, Guterres wants this summit to be more like “show-and-tell”, a meeting where governments share concrete and replicable examples of how they are cutting emissions and boosting resilience to the climate impacts already unfolding. As such, the summit aims to address a glaring deficiency of the Paris agreement. In part, because the agreement made emissions cuts voluntary, global emissions have continued to increase since 2015. On current trends, the earth is heading towards 3-5C of temperature rise – enough, scientists warn, to destroy civilization as we know it.Asked how the world can meet the “well below 2C” target when the current US government is doing all it can to increase global warming, Alba, a career diplomat from Mexico, steered clear of criticizing the Trump administration. “We need higher political will not only in one country but in a number of them,” he said, before adding: “We’re very much impressed by what states, cities and businesses are doing in the US to move into renewables … We are quite confident that the US will contribute to solutions, even if the decision to withdraw by the current administration is maintained.”China, the other climate superpower along with the US, will therefore have to do better as well. China won plaudits in the lead-up to the Paris summit in 2015 by closing many of its coal-fired power plants. But coal burning in China has recently crept back up, and Beijing has also financed construction of coal plants in other countries, particularly in support of its massive “Belt and Road” initiative to construct ports, railways and other infrastructure across Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Alba commends China for promising to go beyond the emissions reductions it pledged in Paris, but he adds, “We are asking them to do much more and in particular to green the Belt and Road initiative. It’s quite important because of the scale of that initiative that they do not support coal plants but instead renewable energy.”When Guterres gavels the summit’s plenary session to order next Monday, the 12-year deadline outlined by the IPCC scientists will have shrunk closer to 11. Meanwhile, the burning of the Amazon, Hurricane Dorian’s devastation of the Bahamas, this summer’s heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, and countless less-heralded disasters illustrate that climate disruption is no longer a worrisome future specter but a punishing current reality.Alba nevertheless draws hope from the heightened public concern and activism against the climate threat. “Compared to 10 years ago, the level of public involvement is very different,” Alba said, “and that’s to a large extent because the news media is talking about it more and young activists are demanding action.”In the United States, activists with the Sunrise Movement and other groups have protested against Democratic and Republican politicians alike and demanded that the government implement a Green New Deal. Championed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, and modeled on the New Deal jobs and investment programs President Franklin Roosevelt implemented to pull the US out of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Green New Deal calls for the government to kickstart the transformations of energy and other sectors the IPCC says are needed. Such a massive investment program will also, the activists say, create millions of jobs and reduce economic inequality. Central to the plan is “climate justice”, the notion that poor and non-white iniduals and communities have suffered worst from climate change and therefore should get precedence for the jobs and opportunities flowing from a Green New Deal.Activist pressure has helped make the Green New Deal the de facto position of the Democratic party in the US, while also spreading the idea overseas. Each of the leading Democratic candidates in the race to replace Trump has endorsed one version or another of a Green New Deal. Bernie Sanders proposes a particularly robust program that will, he promises, “end unemployment” by creating 20m new jobs and also help developing nations dump fossil fuels in favor of renewables.Guterres has gone out of his way to boost the visibility of the climate youth, most notably Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who is the best-known face of the climate movement. Thunberg’s “School Strike For Climate”, begun a year ago in her home town of Stockholm, spread like wildfire around the world, inspiring hundreds of thousands of students to skip classes and take to the streets to demand that governments, in Thunberg’s words, “act like the house is on fire – because it is”. Guterres has invited Thunberg to keynote a special one-day youth climate summit on 21 September and also to address world leaders at the plenary session on 23 September.Alba recognizes that the public is sometimes skeptical of UN conferences, and he acknowledges that the UN “does not have the means to enforce” the commitments made by governments in the Paris agreement. Instead, he puts his faith, again, in the ability of public pressure to compel governments to do the right thing. “As in many other parts of international law,” he says, “the enforcement rests in the follow-up and the ‘name and shame’ role of civil society – to expose that a country is not complying with what they’ve committed to. The media plays an important role there, and so do activists.”Meanwhile, Alba’s own teenage son has given him advice on how to make the case for action: don’t talk so much about the future that youth will inherit but rather about the climate disasters happening now. “He had a point,” says Alba. “This is an emergency we need to deal with today, not tomorrow. Talking about 2030 and 2050 is important because science gives us those dates for achieving certain objectives, but there’s the danger that it tells people that we have time to make these changes. And that is a mistake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6e54031a2e76dfd4d8fe935d7c9c6221668bee1/0_288_4322_2594/master/4322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=048b29d9fb2fb6356d11fd9c55f0c135","title":"country diary ivys weird flowers exert a magnetic attraction on insects","story":"Claxton, Norfolk: You forgive ivy its smothering tendencies when you hear it humming to the drone of feeding beesTo say I have a love-hate relationship with ivy is too simplistic. Because one of the largest organisms in our garden is a much-valued ivy tod (bush), draped over the top of a decapitated 3m-tall cypress stump. Yet I have also had moments of despair, such as the day I realised ivy had choked out the canopy of one of our favourite holly trees, which has never truly recovered.Come September I forgive ivy its relentless self-promotion and when I walked up the lane today, where it has also smothered a whole section of oak hedge, I fell in love with its imperishable emerald all over again. The flowering bushes at this spot swooned in invertebrate drone. Here in one 4m stretch of Hedera helix were colour, complexity, music and drama – all of it driven by those weird and completely unprepossessing ivy flowers.Each globe of blooms begins as a spray of about 20 tiny lime balls on separate stalks arising from a terminal node. Later, these round buds elongate into a sort of cone topped by a nipple, from which peel back five green sepals. The whole structure, even before it opens, seems to be magnetic for feeding insects, which lick and chew the surfaces remorselessly. But finally the cone bursts open and out spring five crinkled stamens, smothered in pollen. That whole moment of vegetable sex is electrifying for insects and inspires the dense whine that now envelops me.Centre stage are the gorgeous little solitary ivy bees, Colletes hederae, which were not named for science until 1993 and which have spread across southern Britain since they were first recorded in this country in 2001. Now they are commonplace in my parish.Yet together with these beautiful vegetarian insects are a host of real killers. Philanthus triangulum is a very handsome solitary wasp, but it is noted as a predator that specialises in honeybees, on whose numbers it can have significant effect. It seems well named as the “beewolf”. Today, however, I notice for once the wolf lying down with the lamb, because the bee and beewolf are feeding on ivy side by side.

This house is not just a fashion label, but a barometer for Britishness. From the stiff upper lip all-weather reliability of the trench coat to the urban swagger of a Burberry check baseball cap, it has come to represent a national identity.British national identity being a fractious business right now, even Riccardo Tisci, a fiercely modernistic designer known for streetwear, indulged in a little nostalgia. His third Burberry collection celebrated the Victorian era as “a time when Britain was going through so much change but also a time when people in this country were really looking to the future,” Tisci said backstage after the show.If the Victorians had worn streetwear, this is how it might have looked. The stage set was stark and futuristic. A carnival-sized sound system of speaker stacks, Stonehenge in scale but sleek and gleaming in glossy Apple Inc white, stood in the centre of the stage of the Troubadour theatre in west London.“Music is as important to me as fashion,” Tisci said, “because it brings positivity and happiness to my life and to so many people’s lives.”Tisci’s Burberry is a compelling world. Bumbags, the accessory of choice for the millennials Tisci targets, were reinvented here as sleek, wide-leather corset belts. Trenchcoats had cinched waists and grand, floorsweeping hems. Evening dresses were layered and draped with lace and plumed feathers. Polo shirts and mini dresses came with tailcoat-styled hems.“The Victorian era is bold, but there is a fragility to it, said Tisci. He noted the aesthetic is very present in London’s Victorian architecture.Under Christopher Bailey’s long and successful stewardship, which ended in the spring of 2018, Burberry settled into national treasure status. The clothes on the catwalk were genteel and romantic, the models softly made-up, the soundtrack designed to tug the heartstrings.But in the year since he arrived at Burberry, Tisci has referenced punk and rave culture, Bambi and British passports, Carine Roitfeld and Peter Saville. Tisci’s Burberry is more urban, less rural. If the mood of Bailey’s Burberry was soft rain in the Peak district, Tisci’s is closer to Peaky Blinders. The Italian designer was a hire nobody in the industry saw coming when he was appointed Bailey’s successor in March 2018. That summer, the house was rocked by environmental outrage when it emerged that it had burnt £28.6m worth of clothes, perfume and accessories to protect its brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c38807eb44cf8eb9499c805fc706ee9ded1abe1d/0_0_5481_3289/master/5481.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d6531695eab9eb3f1e5b0d599f8457d","title":"muscadet lambrusco great 1970s wine revival","story":"Lambrusco, muscadet, Bull’s Blood: after years of neglect, some wines have returned as retro-vintage starsWhatever happened to the bestselling wines of the 1970s and 80s? Some, happily, are no longer with us or have been banished to the dustiest reaches of the corner shop, brands such as Hirondelle, Lutomer Laski Riesling, or Le Piat d’Or, that neither we nor the French adore any more.Others, remodelled, repackaged, occasionally even drinkable, are still slogging it out in the pitiless commercial battlefield of a supermarket near you: Mateus Rosé, Black Tower, Blue Nun.More interesting are the regional appellations that after years of neglect, critical disdain and flatlining sales, have returned as something else entirely. Regions that have gone from cult to own-label mainstream favourite to beyond the pale and back again. The paradigm of the retro-vintage comeback king is beaujolais. The vignerons of the gamay-producing area north of Lyon once sold millions of bottles of nouveau, that bubblegum-and-banana-scented young red bottled within a couple of months of vintage. But after the 1990s, sales collapsed, their reputation for quality in tatters. It’s taken plenty of angsty reflection and, in many cases, financial struggle, but thanks to its cluster of adventurous small producers and its ability to provide the sort of light, fresh red wines that work so well by the glass, beaujolais – even nouveau, from the right producer – has become a must-list for a certain kind of modern wine bar and small-plate restaurant.Muscadet, typecast as a cheap and cheerful partner for seafood, was washed away by the fruit-rich new wines of the New World, its complacent producers having cashed in with enormous quantities of sub-standard, brand-damaging acid water. Again, it’s taken a while, but a hardcore of small producers around the Loire estuary have been chiselling out a reputation for dry whites on a par with chablis.Other regions to have thrown off the 1970s kitsch include: Vinho Verde from northern Portugal, whose whites can be thrillingly peachy and pure where once they tended to the insipid but tart the Veneto, home of trattoria staples white soave and red valpolicella, now responsible for some of Italy’s most elegant wines and the Rheinhessen, once all but synonymous with liebfraumilch, now reestablished as the site of great dry rieslings.But for the full nostalgia-tinted house, nothing beats lambrusco. Not as the sweetly gassy, £2.99 initiation rite for generations of teenagers and pre-loading clubbers, but in its original, gorgeously gastronomic form from Emilia-Romagna: a vivid, finger-staining, antipasti-partnering sparkling red.From a modern master of muscadet, this is a typically luminous dry white, tight and nervy with a dash of salt and zesty citrus and a savoury palate. Perfect for shellfish, and at a price that puts comparable white burgundy to shame.If you grew up on the wince-making acid, prickly spritz and lemony sweetness of old-style supermarket own-label vinho verde, you’d scarcely believe this pristine, racy, floral, citrus and exotic-fruit-scented white came from the same region.There is still plenty of pallid soda-pop-like lambrusco (and, indeed, its perry-based imitator, lambrini) around. But this is the real thing: an intensely dark cherry-fruited sparkling red with salami-matching grip, and a moreish tangy dry finish.The 1980s was the beginning of the end of sherry’s imperial period as a bestselling wine. Now even the fustiest of styles, cream, such as the suavely sweet fruitcakey Solera 1847, is back on the smartest restaurant lists.Before Aussie shiraz and Argentinian malbec, the “bull’s blood” red wines of Eger in Hungary provided British drinkers of the 1970s and 80s with their big red needs. This modern version is a cut above: a deep, spicy, plummy partner for autumnal stews.Alexandre Burguad’s delightful young wine is a far cry from the banana-bubblegum beaujolais nouveau of folk memory: it’s exuberantly fresh, crunchy, currant-fruity and aromatic with a moreishly sappy, charcuterie-friendly freshness.

Not Jürgen Klopp. He sees a team that feels it still has something to prove to the outside world. On that basis the Stadio San Paolo is the perfect spot for the European champions to launch the defence of their title.The Liverpool manager believes victory over Tottenham in Madrid merely whetted his players’ appetite for silverware, not sated it. “If you go nuts and start drinking and taking drugs, driving different cars and leaving your missus at home because you are a Champions League winner then I can’t help you,” said Klopp. “We want to create more stories.”Napoli were a problem in last season’s group stage and but for Alisson’s stoppage-time save from Arkadiusz Milik at Anfield Liverpool would have been eliminated on the final matchday. Liverpool’s problems in the first encounter in Naples were of their own making. Klopp’s side did not have a shot on target as Lorenzo Insigne’s late goal condemned them to the first of three consecutive away defeats in the group phase. It was, by the Liverpool manager’s admission, their worst performance of a triumphant Champions League campaign. A failure to react to Carlo Ancelotti’s tactics was to blame.“We talk a lot about intensity,” Klopp explained. “The Napoli game last season was not intensity, Napoli was an organisation problem. It is all about intensity and how much we have to invest but before that it is all about information. And Napoli play a specific style. We played against them in our defending like they had one ‘six’ but they had two sixes, the cheeky bastards. We knew before we told them, that they had two sixes, but everyone came too late and that was when it started. We tried to change it in the game and nobody listened and nobody could change and in the end they were lucky they scored but we were lucky it was only 1-0.“It really was this kind of off-day. We will have to invest whatever we have in the game and then we have a chance but we don’t go there as a favourite. Yes, we won the competition last season but it is difficult against the runner-up in Italy for the last few seasons, who is really close to Juventus this year and a really strong team. They are different to last year, not too much, but enough to have a view on it.”Roberto Firmino will make his 200th Liverpool appearance on Tuesday and Klopp is expected to make changes to the team that maintained the flawless start to the Premier League season against Newcastle on Saturday.Andy Robertson is a doubt with a knee problem sustained on Saturday. On the opposite flank Trent Alexander-Arnold faces competition from Joe Gomez at right-back and, up against Insigne, a challenge he compares to dealing with Eden Hazard. “He’s that type of player who is tricky to get hold of and mark,” said the Liverpool defender. “Really strong, fast and quite agile.”Alexander-Arnold admits Liverpool have become a prized target for Champions League rivals this season and will relish the responsibility. He said: “A lot of the players we have are world-class players. They know what it takes to win things, what it takes to be successful, so I’m pretty sure we’ll be able to embrace that as a team. I think we have so far this season in the league.“A lot of teams will want to beat us and play different ways and we know that’s going to be the test for us. We need to be ready for all types of tests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/116bc835f658685643779d851471656071162c2b/0_59_2959_1776/master/2959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b315526e0854bd257360971b27971326","title":"manchester united arsenal wsl match report","story":"Manchester United’s Casey Stoney said she was “gutted” and her team “devastated” after a desperate late Daniëlle van de Donk goal, snatched on the rebound amid relentless Arsenal pressure, denied a stunningly resilient home team the first point of their maiden Women’s Super League campaign.“I’m gutted to be honest, not for myself but for the players because I don’t think they deserved it,” said Stoney. “I thought they deserved more out of the game.”It is rare for a promoted side to give any league’s champions a run for their money (though Norwich’s men’s team showed how on Saturday) but United’s climb into the Women’s Super League is no ordinary ascent. The home team spent all last season preparing for their chance to compete against the biggest clubs in the newly professional top tier and it showed here as they attempted to shake the established order.United’s 2-1 Continental League Cup defeat by Arsenal last season had given them a taste of what facing the champions would entail and they had clearly learned the lessons. Only an excellent goal by Caroline Weir was able to break their resolve in their opening fixture against Manchester City and they almost held out against Arsenal.“Relief,” said Joe Montemurro at full time. “A lot of teams are going to find it very difficult here because they are a very good side and we knew it was going to be difficult backing up the Champions League. There was probably a little bit of fatigue in the first half but second half I thought we were brilliant.”In the first half the home team came out looking determined and a raucous crowd, cheering and jeering aplenty, was buoyed by their team pressing the visiting side hard.Arsenal are having their first taste of Champions League football and their leggy start could possibly have been attributed to their 4-0 defeat of Fiorentina on Thursday night.“It’s a new experience for us and to be brutally honest we are still getting used to it it was a long week,” said Montemurro. There was cause for celebration for Arsenal, though, with Jordan Nobbs returning to the starting line up for the first time since rupturing an ACL in November 2018.In the 38th minute the away side found the pass they had been looking for and it characteristically came from Kim Little, who clipped a clever ball to Lisa Evans and the winger swung a cross towards Vivianne Miedema, whose smart header was fantastically saved by Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, at point-blank range. Miedema latched onto the rebound but it was from an acute angle and straight at Earps.In the second half Arsenal moved through the gears but still failed to find the threaded pass they so often rely on to crack teams open. It was the home team that looked to have made the breakthrough when Jane Ross was played through one on one but the Scottish forward hesitated, giving Manuela Zinsberger time to come out and smother the shot.Minutes later Arsenal had their best chance of the half but again Earps was equal to the test. Little weaved her way across the edge of the box, saw a sliver of an opening and struck but Earps pushed the ball away and then threw her body back across goal for the follow-up.With one minute left on the clock the substitute Van de Donk, on for Nobbs, prodded the ball home after Leah Williamson’s shot from distance rebounded off the massed United defenders, a crushingly difficult defeat for a bright home side.“To be fair I felt like it was coming. We had a lot of chances and I think it came after three shots on goal. Viv hit the post, I was like: ‘Come on guys, please put it in the goal.’ Happily it fell at my feet and it went in. It was a bit bouncy bouncy bouncy in, so it was a bit lucky as well.”“And that’s actually a really positive place to be, the fact that we’re talking about fine margins and we’re playing Arsenal and Man City, when we’ve effectively been with the new players for seven weeks and we got together 14 months ago. These teams are established.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67c6d05f0ede2ac746041c95fc887774f05d003/0_69_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fd5c2ed9b71cebea3dbde65ebc30886","title":"honey project brings sweet success for families in zambia mama buci","story":"Social enterprise creates employment and education opportunities by training local people in art of beekeepingA former hedge fund manager has become one of Africa’s most prolific single-source honey producers through a social enterprise that impacts thousands of families.The Zambia-based organisation, Mama Buci – meaning “Mother Honey” in Bemba, the local language – was started 10 years ago by former trader Martin Zuch and has since grown to provide more than 10,000 families with income. Having enjoyed a successful career as a trader in Switzerland, one that brought in “significant amounts of money”, Zuch accepted a chance invitation to church. A religious conversion followed that reoriented the 58-year-old’s life and left him looking for a different way of living.An initial attempt at large-scale farming in Zambia near Victoria Falls failed, but a friend then invited Zuch to collaborate in exploring the commercial potential of beekeeping. So Mama Buci was born, its aim to producing a high-quality honey in the virgin forests of Zambia.With his partner John Enright, Zuch installed top-bar beehives in trees across the bush, paying the families who owned the land to harvest the honey.Almost a decade on, they have placed about 90,000 beehives, impacting between 5,000 and 7,000 families.“It’s a social enterprise on a massive scale,” said Zuch.“John had started it off in a small way and I came in with the bigger investment to make things happen. We started by building beehives out of scrap wood, a top-bar hive, and at first the model didn’t work. But eventually we got it right by reducing the size of the hive and hanging them up in the trees.“We give 10 hives to each family in the bush through our network and then, twice a year, we harvest from the local people and we pay them per kilo for the honey.“We hang the hives high in the trees with a bamboo cane mechanism we wax the inside of the hive and, within a few weeks, it attracts a swarm, and the swarm then builds its home in there.“A family might make between $50 (£40) and $200 a year, some more and some less. But in the bush in Africa, the average earning can be as little as half a dollar a day, so this allows their children to go to school among many other things.”In the next 12 months they are expecting to harvest 550-560 tonnes of honey, the equivalent of roughly 1.2m jars.From there they will sell it, mainly in bulk, to retailers in South Africa and Britain, who then repackage it and sell it as their own high-quality honey.“Here lies the problem, at the moment the majority of the honey gets sold bulk for other people to put their labels on and add their premium. But we could impact so many more people in Africa if we could sell it ourselves retail,” said Zuch.“I don’t think this sort of social enterprise has been done in Africa on this scale before, and we’re looking for funding to build the next 100,000 bee hives. Zambia alone could take 1,000,000 hives at a minimum.“We’re looking for investors that catch the vision and want to help us grow the model and increase our impact.”They have also built a school that started with 60 pupils and now has 400, and they want to replicate that model as they continue to grow.Zuch said environmental concerns are also central to the project, explaining that lack of pesticides greatly increases the taste of the honey, enough of which is left in each hive to sustain production.They also hope to introduce blockchain technology so each jar of honey could be traced back to the exact hive where it had been produced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4025d6646decdda1fc6c18ca64a836da7d464af0/0_902_4016_2410/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c5b33c04f641d55ab6d29d859d7de9","title":"healing crystals wellness mining madagascar","story":"Demand for ‘healing’ crystals is soaring – but many are mined in deadly conditions in one of the world’s poorest countries. And there is little evidence that this billion-dollar industry is cleaning up its act. In February, crystals colonised Tucson. They spread out over carparks and gravel lots, motel courtyards and freeway footpaths, past strip malls and burger bars. Beneath tents and canopies, on block after block, rested every kind of stone imaginable: the opaque, soapy pastels of angeline dark, mossy-toned epidote tourmaline streaked with red and green. There were enormous, dining-table-sized pieces selling for tens of thousands of dollars, lumps of rose quartz for $100, crystal eggs for $1.50. Crystals were stacked upon crystals, filling plastic trays, carved into every possible shape: knives, penises, bathtubs, angels, birds of paradise.It was the month of the Tucson gem shows, a series of markets and exhibitions that collectively make up the largest crystal expo in the world. More than 4,000 crystal, mineral and gemstone vendors had come to sell their wares. They were expecting more than 50,000 customers to pass through, from new age enthusiasts with thick dreadlocks and tie-dye T-shirts, to gallery owners, suited businessmen and major wholesalers. Deals done here would determine the fate of tens of thousands of tonnes of crystals, dispatching them across the US and Europe into museums and galleries, crystal healing and yoga centres, wellness retailers and Etsy stores.Five years ago, crystals were not a big deal. Now, powered by the lucrative combination of social media-friendly aesthetics, cosmic spirituality and the apparently unstoppable wellness juggernaut, they have gone from a niche oddity associated with patchouli and crushed velvet to a global consumer phenomenon. On Instagram, hashtags for #crystals and #healingcrystals tick into the tens of millions. In 2017, the New York Times heralded “the great crystal boom” and in 2018 Hello! described them as the year’s biggest health and wellness trend. Sold as lamps, sex toys, facial massagers or “vaginal eggs” hawked by Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle empire Goop, there is now a crystal for every possible occasion. As Kim Kardashian was recovering from her robbery at gunpoint in 2016, she embraced healing crystals. The model Miranda Kerr has said that she filters all her skincare products through rose quartz “to give the vibration of self-love”.In the US, demand for overseas crystals and gemstones has doubled over the past three years, and quartz imports have doubled since 2014. (Those numbers capture raw stone, but not the crystals imported under many other categories: jewellery, home goods, decorations.) Daniel Trinchillo, owner of Fine Minerals International, a high-end crystal dealership, told me that his business makes between $30m and $40m in sales each year. Trinchillo caters to a growing cohort of celebrities, collectors and investment buyers who want rare and valuable crystals. The most expensive single piece he has sold went for $6m, but he knows of some that have sold for $10m. Trinchillo estimates that high-end dealers now account for about $500m in annual sales. Include the lower end, he said, and you are talking about a highly profitable, multi-billion dollar industry.Despite that explosive growth, the way the crystal industry operates has largely avoided close scrutiny. There is little in the way of fair-trade certification for crystals, and none of the industry-wide transparency schemes developed for commodities such as gold and diamonds. Tracing a crystal from the time it is dragged, dusty and cracked, from the earth, to the polished moment of final sale requires a journey backward down the supply chain: from shop, to exporter, to middleman, to mine, and finally to the men and women who work below the ground, on whose labour a billion-dollar industry has been built.If you want to know where the rose quartz on your shelves comes from, Anjoma Ramartina is a good place to begin. A collection of villages that sits atop some of Madagascar’s largest rose quartz deposits, it is a day’s drive from the capital city of Antananarivo. The further you travel from the capital, the greater the security risks. Large swathes of territory are described as “red zones”, considered unpoliceable by state forces. Rural villages often face raids from armed gangs known as dahalo, who steal cattle, sometimes killing, robbing or raping villagers. In January, the week we arrived in Anjoma Ramartina, three men armed with machetes were killed in a clash with village police. Do not travel or go out at night, people warned. Drive in convoy. Stay off the roads after 5pm.In a cool, dark room in the town council hall, Many Jean Rahandrinimaro, the deputy mayor of Anjoma Ramartina, sunk into a black vinyl couch. “Crystal, amethyst, rose quartz,” he said. “Everything except sapphires and rubies, we mine here.” He placed a few stones on the wooden table in front of him: polished clear quartz and purple amethyst. He estimated that from a population of about 10,000 people, up to a quarter of locals now depended on the mines for some income. Between two and four men died each year in the crystal pits surrounding this village, he said – only two last year, but often it was three or four. “Sometimes it’s very dangerous but they still mine, because they want money,” he said. “There’s the possibility of landslide, that happens a lot here. The soil falls on them and they die.”Landslides are not the only danger for miners. Smashed rocks create fine dust and quartz particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There, they fester, inflaming surrounding cells, increasing the risk of lung cancer and silicosis. Child labour is also widespread: the US Department of Labor and the International Labour Organization estimate that about 85,000 children work in Madagascar’s mines.A few days after our first meeting, I returned to the town hall. In a ruled exercise book, Many Jean traced a finger over the town’s registry of deaths, tapping entries on the page: here and here, the two men who died in the mines last year, recorded in neat cursive handwriting. And here, Benoit Razafimahatratra, who had died two years earlier when he was looking for quartz at a quarry to the east. Many Jean knew where Benoit’s family lived, and offered to show the way on his motorbike.Bomber jacket flapping behind him, Many Jean took us to the next village. Sitting in a small shop that sold fritters and dried fish was Jean Gregoire Randrianarisoa. He looked tired. Yes, his older brother had died, he said. “What killed him was digging for stones, about 15 metres deep. He went into a tunnel and it collapsed from above and he was buried – someone called for help: ‘Help! Zafimahatratra is buried down there!’ That’s when I went with his children to dig him up,” he said.Benoit was about 55 when he died, said his widow, Josephine Rasondrina, a tiny woman, less than 5 feet tall, with hair neatly ided into braids. She brought out a photograph of him. His features had faded. Josephine gestured at her two granddaughters, about six or seven years old, sitting on the steps. “Since my husband died, they stopped going to school. Since my husband died I got really tired.” She raised her fingers to her temple. “I am really tired. Emotionally and physically – because I have to work the field to feed my children.”Common crystals, such as quartz, can form almost anywhere around the world, when water and steam carry mineral particles into fractures in the earth. Drawn together by the mutual attraction of their electrical charges, their molecules stack in orderly sequences, forming defined planes and repeating facets that can create the pleasing shapes – geodes, prisms – that they’re sought for. In the mineral-rich earth of central Madagascar, villagers often find quartz and citrine deposits by chance, when they are revealed by landslide or washed down to nearby riverbeds. The mines dug to meet growing demand are often improvised, operated off the books and without permits.One of these makeshift mines lies about an 18-mile hike from Anjoma Ramartina’s nearest road. Rakotondrasolo, the man who villagers called the mine owner, found the site about 20 years ago, and continues to work there, along with his family, to this day. One morning, he agreed to show me the mine. Rakotondrasolo is tall and very thin. His worn flannel shirt was buttoned over a T-shirt with the face of Andry Rajoelina, Madagascar’s newly elected president. (The T-shirts were everywhere, after being thrown from trucks and doled out at political rallies across the country during the 2018 election campaign.) The red dust of the landscape had worked its way into the weave of his clothing until every garment was infused with terracotta orange.As we made our way along the red dirt track to the mine, the sun was directly above, shimmeringly hot. Here and there was a sparkle among the scrubby grass: hunks of pink crystal, scattered at the path’s edge. Walking behind Rakotondrasolo, his wife pointed: “The stones are beautiful,” she said quietly, “but the work is very hard.” Then the grass of the track ended sharply and the deep red cavern of the mine fell away in front of us. “Keep away from the edge,” said Rakotondrasolo, gesturing to where the ground was cracked and unstable. The pit dropped 15 metres deep, narrowing as it deepened. On the sheer face of rock were cross-hatched marks of spades and pickaxes. At the far side of the cavern, a huge pile of rose-coloured stones caught the sunlight. At the bottom, a passage disappeared, curving out of the light.“Be careful,” he said, as we trod over the edge of the crater, “the rocks are sharp.” Rose quartz cracked underfoot: jagged, gleaming, a little translucent, shining like the flesh of a fresh-filleted tuna. Later, he lifted a worn trouser leg to show the scars he had acquired from a lifetime of mining: on the right leg, where falling stones crushed his shin, and on the left where a sharp edge split the skin, requiring six stitches.At other times, this crater would have been busy with the sound of men at work – his sons and nephews, who would come to dig and then split the cost of stone they sold – but today it was silent except for Rakotondrasolo’s careful footsteps. They had stopped work: rains had been heavy, and they worried that the water made the cavern less stable. “I was afraid, and was afraid for my children because of this soil. It can collapse on them. I asked them to stop working here,” Rakotondrasolo said.He threw in a handful of gravel and it tumbled to the bottom. Of his 10 children, seven worked with him in the mine. The boys started at the age of about 14. When they find a thick seam of quartz they smash it out of the rock, then chain the pieces together. Some blocks are small, but others are 100kg or even 200kg. The miners drag the boulders out of the hole, sometimes five people hauling together, up on to the grass embankment and toward the hill where lorries come to load them.I asked where the crystals went from there. “To the ports,” Rakotondrasolo shrugged. He did not know. Somewhere overseas. A long time ago a client brought him a rose orb, cut and polished into a sphere, to show him what eventually became of some of the stones he had mined. But the buyers mostly say little about what the crystals are used for or where they end up. They pay him and leave – about 800 ariary, or 23¢ a kilo, he said – 17¢ for lower quality. It is not much when the money is split between the men at work: 800 ariary buys a cup of rice at the village market.As Rakotondrasolo stepped away from the crater, a low hiss sounded behind him. We turned back to see a thin layer of red gravel, loosened from the wall, slide down into the hole.While some mines are large, open pits, others are claustrophobically small: networks of tunnels piercing the earth. About 120 miles east of Anjoma Ramartina lies Ibity, a small village surrounded by tourmaline mines, where you have to dig deep to find stones.“The deeper you go, the more difficult it is to breathe,” said Italy Miliama, a shopkeeper at the centre of the village, scooping coffee into enamel cups.“Once you see a stone, you follow it to find the other stones,” said one of his friends. “We dig, dig, dig. We call it the stone way, the way of stones.”The mines at Ibity spread out like an ochre moonscape. On the morning I visited, about 20 people were above ground sifting through the soil. Among them, a local miner named Jean Baptiste Rakotondravelo and his son stood barefoot, turning a large, improvised pulley. Their backs strained against the weight. A moment later, up came a large yellow jerrycan, full of red earth from below. Jean Baptiste’s son carried it to his mother and young siblings and dumped it on a pile of dirt that they sifted with their fingers. The day was hot, the sun nearing its peak. “It’s extremely hard work,” Jean Baptiste said. “It can’t be done by a few people. It has to be done by many.”At his feet was a hole about a metre in diameter, with sheer sides like a well. Shining my torch down the hole, I couldn’t see to the bottom. Every so often a faint shout echoed up from the darkness, and Jean Baptiste and his son put their backs again to pulling up the bucket. His other sons were working down there, Jean Baptiste told me, digging for tourmaline. He shrugged: “Go down if you like.”Near the top of the hole, it was possible to make out mosquitoes catching the light. As they turned the pulley and I descended, gripping the rope with both hands, the light retreated. The passage down was tight, the damp earth walls grazing my back, elbows and knees. Reaching the bottom, the air felt thin and it was a little harder to draw a full breath. On one side, there was a small horizontal tunnel with room only to crawl.I crouched and shouted into the darkness. “Salama!” two young voices called back, and deep in the tunnel, pair of dim headlamps turned to face me. Two boys blinked into the torchlight. The smallest wore a yellow cloth baseball cap, and his eyes were wide, mouth slightly open with surprise. Their names were Roland and Tavita: Jean Baptiste’s sons, who he says are about 14 and 17. They started working down here two years ago, spending hours digging underground, crouching in the dark, backs curved, calves aching.Deep underground, we looked mutely at each other for a moment. Ducking into the crawl-space, I was conscious of the weight of dirt resting above us: about 19 tonnes of soil and rock, suspended only by its own natural cohesion. Roland and Tavita squatted, jamming a spade or crowbar into the soil to dislodge it and pack it into the jerrycan. When it was full they would crawl back toward the light, shoving the heavy dirt bucket ahead of them, to be dragged up top.“When it’s too long they can have difficulty breathing, so they come out,” Jean Baptiste said, back at the top of the well. Above ground, the boys’ mother, Odette, sat working alongside two generations of children, the youngest a fat-cheeked six-month-old girl. Odette sifted through the dirt, searching for a rock shaped differently from the rest: the small, wine-red and green crystal, tourmaline. “Sometimes we go months without finding any,” she said. They had found just one today, about the size of a knuckle.Odette held it out to me, streaked with red dust, in the middle of her palm. At that moment, it was worth just a few cents. But in the months to come, it would slide along the global supply chain, its value multiplying with each stage of the journey.For the crystals mined in Anjoma Ramartina, the path out of the country is through a company called Madagascar Specimens, which exports about 65 tonnes of carved crystals a year. At its premises, a converted house in the outer suburbs of Antananarivo, boxes of crystals were stacked against the wall. A row of shining SUVs were parked outside the house. Samples stood on the disused fireplace: carved angels, pyramids, geodes, wands. The rose quartz had been trucked in rough from Anjoma Ramartina by a local middleman, the village’s former mayor, who bought large quantities from Rakotondrasolo’s mine.The owner of Madagascar Specimens, Liva Marc Rahdriaharisoa, a tall man in dark jeans, wire-rimmed glasses and a navy T-shirt, gestured to the stack of boxes to his left, packed for shipping. “This, for example, is going to Canada. This to Netherlands. This to the United States,” he said.He lifted the lid on a box of quartz massage wands. “These are very popular.” Then another box of rose quartz hearts: “Some of our best sellers,” he said. “Crystals are the most popular stones now – many customers are looking for it, because – I’m not sure of the English – the medicine with crystals is very popular now. Like therapy, the belief crystals have healing power, you know? It’s very – how do you say? – trendy.”The gem and mineral expo in Tucson was a key point in Liva Marc’s year. “That is where you’re looking for customers,” he said. “You see all customers from around the world: Chinese, Japanese, New Zealand, Australian. It is the biggest market in the world. We go there to exhibit, to sell, but most important is to find customers there.”Between the buyers in the US and the mines in Madagascar was a gulf of experience, which, sitting in the courtyard of Liva Marc’s small factory, he found hard to express. “It’s like two galaxies,” he said, grinning and shaking his head. “It’s a big difference. If I say to people at the mine what Tuscon is like, they will never understand. And if I say to the Tucson people to come here, they will never understand. It’s very different worlds.”Madagascar Specimens exports some crystals rough, but its workshop in Antananarivo also works the stones, cutting them into shapes, grinding and polishing the faces. From Liva Marc’s perspective, refining the stone in Madagascar means creating steady jobs and keeping more of the value of the crystals in the country. With stone that was exported rough and then carved in China or the US, almost none of the profit stayed in Madagascar.The plunder of Madagascar’s resources for profit is nothing new. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the country was a source of slaves, bought by Europeans and sent to work in brutal conditions, often on sugar plantations on the islands of Mauritius, Réunion and Rodrigues. When the French colonised Madagascar in 1895, they outlawed slavery, but ushered in a new era of forced labour and extraction, with tens of thousands of tonnes of rosewood and millions of francs’ worth of gold shipped offshore each year. More than a century later, the country’s riches still rarely benefit the Malagasy people, says Zo Andriamaro, a sociologist and human rights analyst. Gold, cobalt, sapphires, crystals: she sees them all as part of the same old story, resources siphoned out of the country for the benefit of foreign companies. “There has to be some more systematic way of controlling and regulating the market for all types of minerals coming from here,” she says. “It is totally unjust.”Mining also threatens Madagascar’s rainforest. When new mining sites are discovered, sometimes thousands of men migrate to mine, encroaching on protected environmental areas and threatening the survival of endangered species. Embracing mining on a larger scale is “intrinsically, fundamentally unsustainable and destructive”, Andriamaro says. “You can never pretend that you will restore the environment to its initial state.”The month after we spoke in Madagascar, Liva Marc and a shipping container full of his stones landed in Arizona, bound for the Tucson shows. I met him in a hotel lobby, one of three retail spots he had in the city. Business was good, he said. Buyers from all over the world had come.The stalls around him showcased towering display pieces: rose quartz boulders, massive amethyst geodes. They had been cleaned, polished and set on display, but he still looked at them and thought of their origins. “All these big pieces – imagine how they must dig it. How difficult it must be,” he said. “Imagine how it starts.”While the crystal business is booming, and largely among consumers who tend to be concerned with environmental impact, fair trade and good intentions, there is little sign of the kind of regulation that might improve conditions for those who mine them.Julia Schoen, co-founder of the crystal drink bottle company Glacce (tagline “Luxury Spiritual”) told me that ethical sourcing is “the No 1 priority” for her company. Schoen was speaking on the phone from her office in New Orleans, where she told me she was surrounded by crystals that had been unboxed and laid out, waiting to be blessed by staff, who would burn sage smudge sticks and pray to cleanse them before use.Glacce sells water bottles and metal straws embedded with rose quartz, amethyst and other crystals, which are supposed to transform ordinary water into a “crystal elixir”, where the water takes on the healing properties of the crystal. The bottles were touted by Vanity Fair as “2018’s Status Symbol” and are sold by bohemian-themed fashion retailer Free People, as well as Goop. Schoen said sales of the bottles, which retail for $60-$100, had increased exponentially since they started the business, and demand often outstripped supply.But even with a booming market, she said, the company didn’t yet have a budget to track their crystals to their source at the mines. Instead, Glacce depended on Chinese middlemen to select crystals, including those from Madagascar. Schoen told me that Glacce’s suppliers “know that we do not want to be having our money go towards a mine that’s using child labour. They know all these things.” At present, she said, they considered transparency a high priority and hoped to develop relationships with inidual mines by 2020, but could offer no concrete reassurances about the current conditions of their miners.“In an industry that has not been so regulated and maybe hasn’t had so many eyeballs on it, there are obviously practices that most people who are purchasing crystals would not want to know about,” Schoen acknowledged. “You know, at the end of the day it’s like, our intentions are – ” she paused. “I think we’re clear what our intentions are.”The challenge of sourcing crystals ethically is one faced by the industry as a whole: Glacce, Goop or any given Etsy vendor are no more culpable than the next crystal dealer. Every retailer I spoke to raised the question of price. Would crystal consumers really be willing to pay more to guarantee safer, child labour-free mines, or a fair wage for miners? Schoen compared it to the organic food movement: if enough people wanted assurance of their products’ provenance, the supply systems would develop.Bajoras visited Madagascar often, but rarely made it out to the mines, opting instead to deal with middlemen in the cities. But he knew the villages of Anjoma Ramartina and Ibity: “Yeah. All our rose quartz comes from that area. All the tourmaline comes from there,” he said.And if some of the conditions are truly awful? “Awful is relative, remember,” he shot back. The volume of his voice rose slightly, but he was still smiling. “Your job looks horrible to me. I feel for you. I’m glad that you’re willing to do it, because we need people like you to do it, but I ain’t fuckin’ doing it, no way. I would rather die in a mine, any day, no doubt. Holy shit. No. Not happening. Spell check? You’re out of your fucking mind.”Meanwhile, the $4.2tn wellness industry rolls on, bolstered by profits from cheap crystals and a generation looking for alternative modes of healing. Bajoras was confident his stones had healing power. After all, he said, if uranium could kill you, why shouldn’t lithium quartz be able to help cure your depression? And when you broke it down to an elemental level, he said, people are mostly minerals and water anyway. “You’re hydrated mineral powder,” he told me. “You are! You’re like Kool-Aid.”Beneath a tented canopy beside the Tucson freeway, his colleague Alexa Stamison was selling an array of Madagascan rose quartz, carnelian and amethyst. Stamison had a warm, open manner and an encyclopedic knowledge of their stones.A woman dressed all in white – crocheted shirt, maxi skirt and headscarf draped over her top-knot – approached the stall. “How much is this carnelian?” she asked. The stone was $30. A stone of empowerment, Stamison told me, great for women going out on their own or moving into a new home.“I think I need it, it was just calling to me and I couldn’t walk away,” the woman said. “I don’t need a bag, I’ll just carry it.” She walked away, cradling the stone.If anything, Stamison wonders if the circumstances of miners in Madagascar, “makes the pieces a lot more special. Because I know some person in a little baby hut was actually polishing it by hand, and they’re setting their intentions into it, too,” she said. “People’s intentions and people’s energy are put into the stones as they’re producing it.”“So the circumstances they’re mined in, they are embedded into the stone somehow?” I asked.“I think so. A little bit, it has to be. It has to be.”Additional research by Holifeno Hantanrinoro and Teddy Rahenintsoa• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5a8600abd1bda1b74a28bee75b5f95cd3f80f9/0_0_3376_2262/master/3376.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09629712a643474bbdbaf54883cb35b0 700w","title":"the long view whats next for your money","story":" From savings and investments to debt clearance, we ask UK residents what goals they have for their money.

Others buy property as an investment, which can generate a rental income and may grow in value. But we’ve also seen property prices fluctuate, which can affect short-term liquidity, so this needs to be carefully considered from every perspective.We hit the streets to find out about people’s financial goals and whether or not they had put in place plans to make those goals happen.Providing for family was a big priority for many. With the rising costs of obtaining a university degree, and less secure work prospects for the next generation, some are feeling less certain about their children’s futures. “My goal is to put my daughter through university and to pay for her education. She wants to study fine art and to do a foundation course initially, so that’s the biggest thing I’m funding at the moment. I do have a financial adviser who I see now and then, who has given me advice on the best way to invest. I have a plan in place – although I’m not sure how much it will cost exactly. As a self-employed worker, finances and pensions can be complicated, but I’ve been investing into a pension since my 20s. In hindsight I probably should have invested in property!”“As a nurse who has worked in A\u0026ampE for a long time, I’m all about living for the moment and spending time with loved ones. Financially, I am stable and have put money aside for my children if they need it. I also have a few months’ wages saved up, in case something breaks in the house. But that’s it – I don’t believe in making big goals and saving up for very expensive things I don’t need.”For more information about saving for your children, go to HSBC’s saving for children guideThe majority of the people we spoke to mentioned buying property and owning a flat or house as their primary goal. For many it seems to offer the security of housing, as well as a form of investment.“I’m about to move to Sweden and I’d like to buy a property there with my partner, which might be fairly expensive. My partner and I are savers, definitely. We already have the money saved up for the purchase and I don’t have any debt. I have only ever used my credit card for things like flights and tend to use cash a lot, to avoid spending unnecessarily. I used to shop a lot but that’s changed – I don’t want to be in debt and overpaying for things I don’t need.”“My goal is to get a mortgage, so I can finally get on the property ladder – but I was recently made redundant, which wasn’t on the cards. It wasn’t great, but the plus side is that I was given a good redundancy package and I already had some savings. My uncle is an independent financial adviser, so he has given me help to get the ball rolling, but my main task is to find a new job.”For more information about securing your first home, go to HSBC’s first-time buyer’s guideOther respondents want to put money away to set up their own businesses – from marketing agencies to pizza joints. According to them, the freedom and independence that comes with running their own venture is the primary draw.“I want to run my own marketing company in Spain – where I’m from – once I graduate, so I’d say that’s my financial goal. Once I’ve done my master’s, I’ll start to save up money for the business. I’ve been asking my parents for money a lot lately, so I do need to have a proper plan in place – it’s just difficult when you’re studying and don’t have much free time. I’m really looking forward to the independence working for yourself brings, and I really like the idea of being challenged creatively.”For more information about finding the right finance for your business, go to HSBC’s guide to business borrowingSome respondents had very specific goals in mind as well as specific measures to help to fund them.“My aim this year is to finish paying for my extension and landscape gardener! I’m retired, so I spend a lot of time at home and in the garden. Last year, I downsized from a larger house to a smaller one, so I have the money to pay for it, which is lucky. I don’t have a mortgage or any huge outgoings and I’m pretty good at staying on top of my finances, but obviously these things cost money. My old house had a stream running alongside it, so I’d like a water feature in my new home, too – that’s the plan, anyway.”Another challenge for millions of people across the nation is dealing with accumulated debts. Getting on an even keel financially is the obvious springboard to building a more secure future, so getting out of the red and into the black is a common goal.“I’m determined to clear my debts. I’m already putting plans in place to do that over the next few years, including the four-month project management course I’m currently enrolled on. It can be difficult working and studying at the same time, but my goal is to land a job in the project management sector, and hopefully start to earn more. That should mean I’m able to find my way out of debt by making regular payments.”For more information about repaying your debts efficiently, go to HSBC’s guide to repaying your debts.Bear in mind, the value of investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back what you invest.Whatever your goals and no matter your level of confidence with investing, HSBC could help you make better-informed decisions and could help you plan better.

Jo Richings, 50, a business coach, author and speaker from Bristol, says she’s keen to invest but is flummoxed by the options available, and she admits she doesn’t have the time to spend researching the alternatives.“At the moment, half of my savings are in the bank and the other half is held in premium bonds, so there’s no interest being made,” she says. “I’m quite risk-averse when it comes to stocks and shares, and don’t know much about what to invest in. I know I need to do more but I haven’t got the patience for it.”However, the current economic climate means it’s more important than ever to take a long-term view on our financial futures, whether it’s saving for – and then living through – retirement, or simply making sure loved ones are taken care of, argues James Hewitson, Head of Wealth and Advice at HSBC. But, he notes, many people think investing is not for them because they believe they are not wealthy enough.“This comes from a common misconception that you need a lot of spare cash to start investing,” he says. “Others simply don’t know where to begin and even if they look into investing themselves they encounter technical jargon – which is a major turn off.”HSBC is taking steps to help its 38 million customers worldwide manage their day-to-day finances and save for the future. The bank aims to break down those barriers stopping people from investing and instead provide a wide range of modern and accessible tools with 247 help whenever customers want and need it. These include My Investment, where customers can create and access tailored investment advice starting with £1,000, in just a few minutes, and InvestDirect, an easy-to-use system with access to a range of shares and tools to help the selection process. For those not sure if they are ready to invest, the bank has a try-before-you-buy function, allowing consumers to gain confidence by road testing the stocks and shares market as a virtual investor before deciding to go ahead.These financial planning and investment services are available to many millions of customers, from those who are starting out with a few hundred pounds to put away for a rainy day, right up to people who are ready to retire and want to know how best to invest their pension pots.“As our services are one part of a customer’s broader banking relationship, we can provide help and support on all aspects of a customer’s financial life – not just savings and investments,” says Hewitson.Plan for the futureInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.

You spend a sleepless night angsting about how you’ll make ends meet when you eventually retire. You keep putting off making an appointment with a financial adviser. Exhibiting these behaviours might mean you share a guilty secret with many adults: we’re in denial about our finances.“There’s so much baggage attached to money,” says Simonne Gnessen, founder of Wise Monkey Financial Coaching. “It’s one of the last taboo subjects. We’re more likely to talk about our sex lives than money.”This is where having a financial life plan comes into its own. “A plan of action can give you a sense of control,” says Glenda Marchant, an accredited coach and mentor with The Spark Initiative. “It’s when we feel life is just pushing us around and we have no say that we start to feel stressed and anxious.”Goals before financesHowever, creating a financial life plan doesn’t actually start with your finances. To start, you need to examine your ambitions for your work and home life. “First and foremost it’s important to know what your true values are, then consider the goals that are significant to you,” says Marchant. “It could be that it’s important to you to feel settled, so you want to buy your own place. Or you might love to explore, so you need the time and money to go travelling. What would a new life look like for you and what plans do you need to put in place to achieve that dream?”James Hewitson, Head of Wealth \u0026amp Advice at HSBC UK, says: “Most people’s budgeting and planning focuses on the short term – for instance, a holiday or a new car. A life plan, by contrast, is about the everyday version of you in the future.”Inflows and outflowsThe first step towards achieving your goals is to face up to the true state of your finances. Spending time understanding the monthly flow of money going in and out allows you to recalibrate your day-to-day living – if, for example, you want to get married in a couple of years.However, Hewitson debunks the oft-spouted advice that young people could save money for a deposit on a house if only they’d cut back on flat whites or avocado on toast.“The most important thing for people when it comes to getting over the fear of setting a life plan is to start small and in a way that works for them. The concept of ‘not buying a coffee and investing the money instead’ frankly doesn’t work for many people – they simply don’t make the link between planning for their future and their daily coffee consumption.”Instead, you should look to invest a small amount of cash little and often by setting up a weekly or monthly direct debit into a savings or investment account. This can help you start the habit of taking steps towards achieving a bigger goal.Take actionHaggle for a better deal on your home insurance. Check your credit card repayment rate. Pay into that company pension plan. And consider investing your money instead of just leaving it in a savings account. After all, long-term investments are an obvious way to align your finances with your long-term goals.“To make the choice between consuming or investing, you need to know the life you want in the future,” says Hewitson. “Otherwise it becomes easier to reverse those decisions and give up your long-term ambitions.”However, he stresses the importance of starting the process early – ideally in your thirties: “The less time you give yourself, the less options you’ll have. The same goes for doing it at your own pace rather than when you’re under pressure because of events such as redundancy.”Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC UK could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

There was no communication for a week, so I complained again and another engineer came and told me the same thing.On 23 August, with no progress, I demanded to speak to a manager. When I told him I had received a bill for my line rental, he said it would be waived, but it has been taken out of my account by direct debit. He transferred calls to my mobile, but it is pay-as-you-go, so is very expensive, and it has variable reception. I received an email to say the fault would be repaired by 29 August. But on the evening of 28 August BT apologised, saying it would take another five working days. It said it was doing all it could, but it was all up to Openreach (part of BT). This has caused me much distress.SS, Maidstone, KentThe way you were treated was clearly unacceptable. As soon as we reported your case to BT, all the delays seemed to stop.

It was bad enough getting owned on Twitter by the actor who played the Incredible Hulk – comparing yourself to a comic book hero with anger management issues was always asking for trouble when you’ve got form with the Camberwell police. Classic Dom.But Boris Johnson’s day just got a whole lot worse when he was completely owned by about 50 unthreatening protesters – this was Luxembourg, where crime waves are measured in the number of people not paying parking fines – and Xavier Bettel, the country’s prime minister.Faced with a handful of people shouting: “We don’t like you very much,” Johnson imploded under the weight of his own narcissism. The Incredible Bulk morphed from green to yellow and fled sobbing indoors. He’d been in some tricky situations before where the future of the world had been at risk from super-soldiers powered by gamma radiation. But nothing as dangerous as this.He begged Bettel to move their joint press conference somewhere less noisy. Preferably somewhere no one would ask him any difficult questions. Bettel demurred. The lecterns were set up, the journalists were in place and he’d go ahead without him. Johnson was about to be humiliated by the second smallest country in the EU. Taking back control by losing control. Classic Dom.To be fair, the Luxembourg trip had already turned sour in the lunchtime showdown with his arch-enemy, Jean-Claude “Thanos” Juncker. Thanos had tried to trick him into revealing his top secret Brexit plan. He’d even asked him to put it down in writing. In writing! What kind of fool did Thanos take him for? He might be green, but he wasn’t that green. So instead, the Bulk had palmed him off with some pifflepafflewifflewaffle. If he didn’t know what he was talking about then there was no way Thanos would.It had been near mortal combat. The Bulk could tell he had landed some crushing blows by the disdain and irritation with which Thanos had described their meeting as almost entirely pointless because no new proposals had been put forward. And the killer blow had been the Bulk’s own statement saying he was aware time was running out and that the negotiators would soon be meeting on a daily basis.Soon – there was no rush. He might be on day 26 of the 30 in which he had promised his other nemesis, Angela “the Leader” Merkel, an alternative to the Northern Ireland backstop, but his superpowers meant he wasn’t constrained by the quantum physics of the space-time continuum.But even the Bulk had to admit he had been wrongfooted by Xavier “the Abomination” Bettel. No one could have expected a villain of the Abomination’s tiny stature to face down a few people – some even wearing sandals – waving placards that read: “Bog Off Boris” and shouting nasty things such as: “Go home liar.” Rather than cowering under a table – discretion was sometimes the better part of valour even for a superhero – the Abomination had taken his life in his hands and gone outside to talk to the media.The Abomination had begun in measured terms, sounding reasonable as he gestured to where Boris should have been. The Bulk had become the Sulk and been “empty-lecterned” on the world stage. He’d never live it down at the next Marvel Comics reunion. Then the Abomination began to turn really nasty as his exasperation channeled Brenda from Bristol. AKA Galactus. The Abomination had had enough. He was at his wits’ end. He was sick to death of the Sulk getting all worked up, going green and splitting his suits.Hell, no one had ever expected the Sulk to keep to his diet and if he lost his temper and spilled the odd glass of wine then that was his own business. But what the Abomination couldn’t stand any more was the Sulk’s bullshit. Boris was the superhero without any superpowers. A figment of Dom’s imagination. A man without qualities. Someone so delusional, he actually imagined that people believed he had a workable Brexit plan.So this was the Abomination’s moment to break the politician’s code. To quit the pretence and tell the truth. The Sulk was a charlatan. An impostor who had never really believed in Brexit anyway. The Joker whose music-hall act had long since stopped being funny. Brexit was an unmitigated disaster for everyone and the Sulk was wilfully playing with people’s futures to prolong his career. No one trusted him and when the shit hit the fan, the Sulk would have no one to blame but himself.The Abomination looked like he had plenty more to say, but one of his minders dragged him away. The world looked on in amazement. No one had ever seen the Sulk humiliated in this way before. And what had been seen could never be unseen. Back in Westminster, Dom rubbed his hands. Now no one would be talking about David Cameron any more. “But no one really cares about Dave,” whimpered the Sulk. Dom smiled. That’s what had made today’s fiasco even more brilliant. He had the bases covered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6bd8ad64b7e30f71b4bbe73daafa3c23d8c648/0_0_3900_2341/master/3900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b5cdf6d954cfbce0d1d20094f399fd8","title":"eu citizens feel safer in scotland than in england report says","story":"EU citizens experienced a ‘less hostile’ atmosphere in Scotland during referendumEU citizens feel more welcome and safer in Scotland than they do in England, university researchers have found.Interviewees from 13 different EU states living in Scotland acknowledged that the atmosphere was different in the run up to the referendum and was “not, or less hostile” than their experience of the aftermath in England.“While frustration, anxiety, and disappointment are shared by all participants, we found a stark difference on how EU nationals feel about post-referendum Britain whether they live in England or Scotland,” said Nando Sigona, a professor at the University of Birmingham’s Institute for Research into Superersity which conducted the study.The vote to remain, combined with reassurance from Nicola Sturgeon in a letter directly addressed to EU nationals were considered major factors between the experience of EU citizens in Scotland and England.“I don’t remember what the letter said but I remember that we got that, me and Fernando and it was so nice to receive this,” said a Portuguese-Brazilian woman.The report, EU families and Eurochildren in Brexiting Britain, found there was still unease over future life.One UK national married to an EU national who have five UK-born children said they feel Brexit is “saying to me the way I live my life is no longer acceptable because I married a foreigner”.Another interviewee spoke of fears they could not bring their elderly parents to the country to look after them even though they had lived here more than 20 years.Others said their self confidence in their identity had been undermined and they had been forced into taking British citizenship.One interviewee from Romania said: “Frankly before Brexit I don’t think I would have gone for something like this. I would have been just happy as a I am. I don’t need to be a British citizen. I don’t feel I want to be a British citizen. Now I feel I should be.”They also felt less disenfranchised because the discussion of Scottish identity including EU families during the 2014 independence referendum, in which they had a right to vote.“EU citizens in Scotland are worried about Brexit and what it will mean to them and the future of their children. But they also feel at home in Scotland, more than elsewhere in the UK. They feel valued for their contribution. More importantly, they feel they can belong to the Scottish nation because this is not in opposition with being also French, Italian, Polish and European,” said Sigona.In families of mixed parentage, Polish was the top nationality, followed by German and Irish.Nazek Ramadan, the director of Migrant Voice and partner of the Eurochildren project, has called on policymakers across the UK to take note of the research to ensure that all migrants in the UK “feel safe and comfortable, and have a chance at a good and prosperous life”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa51ded82668bba01eb615ff13ee79c79895f45c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8087b21cf45991c1f682adaa92855831","title":"england maro itoje tonga rugby world cup","story":"• Squad are bonding well but looking forward to action• Itoje: Sunday’s game in Sapporo cannot be taken lightlyMonday was a national holiday in Japan to honour the elderly. It was fitting, then, that when Billy Vunipola appeared on stage at England’s World Cup welcome ceremony he declared his World Cup wish to be that he and his teammates grow old and grey and still fondly reflect on this tournament. “I wish that whatever we do in the next few weeks will live with us for the rest of our lives.”If it was a surprise that Vunipola did not opt for what everyone in the audience expected – that England win the World Cup – it was clearly rehearsed and undoubtedly on message. It was a soundbite that points to team unity, or “social cohesion” as Eddie Jones calls it, which has been among the head coach’s top priorities in the buildup to this World Cup.Vunipola was making a wish because part of the welcome ceremony required a player to paint one eye of a traditional Japanese daruma doll and England’s No 8 got the nod. As and when it comes true, the other eye is to be painted. That it caused much amusement among his teammates certainly suggests there is unity among these players and it must be said they do seem to be enjoying each other’s company in Miyazaki.Maro Itoje reeled off a few sentences in Japanese at the start of his speech and Ben Youngs also took a turn on stage to receive a tengu mask – considered to frighten away bad spirits and therefore seen as good luck – while the event began with a bang, or lots of them during 10 relentless minutes of taiko martial arts drums. All of the squad received their World Cup welcome medals and caps from one of their former captains and now World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who delivered a brief speech though hardly Churchillian in tone. Truth be told he was outshone by the governor of Miyazaki, Shunji Kono, who in no uncertain terms urged England to go forth and conquer.On the whole it was a low-key event, or certainly compared with Wales’s open training session 200 miles to the north, but it served its purpose for the local dignitaries and, more than that, it heightened the sense of anticipation. England have been in Japan since Monday but still do not begin their campaign for days and the coaching staff have explained how the players have been straining at the leash. Itoje more than once told of how he “can’t wait to get going”, while Jonny May is similarly eager for the match against Tonga in Sapporo on Sunday to arrive. “I’ve felt ready for a little while now but it’s just been a case of keeping to the process.”It is a match England are expected to win comfortably – for they will have far too much firepower for the Pacific Islanders, who are expected to be physical if ultimately inferior. Itoje said England are on red alert, however, pointing to the prowess of Billy and Mako Vunipola, who have strong Tongan heritage. “I’ve seen what those two have done to people! It can be dangerous if you allow it to be,” Itoje said. “We know how physical they are and how much Tonga as a country love rugby. They’ll definitely be up for it. We know that they’re an incredibly physical side. From one to 31 they have big boys who are physical and aggressive. They have huge athleticism as well.”England have harder tasks further down the line, though May believes this squad contains the most potent attacking threats of all the contenders. It is some statement that may raise a few eyebrows in the New Zealand camp but May is convinced the variety of back-three options England have alongside him in Joe Cokanasiga, Elliot Daly, Anthony Watson, Ruaridh McConnochie and Jack Nowell is unrivalled.“It is like nothing I have ever been a part of,” he said. “I look around the room and the teammates and the talent we have, and depth as well, for me the belief is that we can beat anybody if we are at our best and I genuinely believe we will peak at this World Cup.”Asked if any other team has such a variety of firepower to compare with England’s, May said: “I would say not. Do teams have great players? Of course they do. It is going to be fine margins. It is a tight tournament in terms of how competitive it is going to be, more than any other World Cup I have seen. It will come down to who produces it on the day and who is ready for it and mentally who can handle it. It is going to be a huge Test but I believe this team is ready for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/795f618f88fb9b10409bb2d86e9c70ffa677d591/167_531_5301_3181/master/5301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d0a77bbbfe2f912a5ebc28079cf474","title":"england sacrificing ashes for world cup win appears worthwhile","story":"It was not a perfect summer and the Test side requires work but Trevor Bayliss delivered the prize England coveted the mostAfter it was all over there were smiles rather than jubilation at the Oval and a few sighs of relief – from both sides. Australia were content, having retained the Ashes England could take comfort from what was almost a copybook victory in the final Test, which allowed them to square the series. The England side might have crumpled after the defeat at Old Trafford but they came back strongly with Joe Root overseeing everything adroitly in the field the Australians needed more than 103 runs in the match from Steve Smith.Amid the post-match ceremonies the Specsavers hoarding was a wee bit one-eyed, highlighting the drawn series rather than the destiny of the Ashes. Then the players, many of whom had every reason to be exhausted after a wonderful, relentless summer, shook hands warmly and mingled in the dressing rooms – just as they should after 23 days of raw, flawed, riveting Test cricket.There must be plenty of mutual respect there. How could one not admire the ugly brilliance of Smith, who scored all those runs on surfaces that nearly all the other batsmen found so treacherous? Or Pat Cummins, the leading wicket-taker, who pounded in match after match, never flagging, always fast and on target, for his 29 wickets? Or Marnus Labuschagne, bouncing back to his feet after a knock on the head, to score crucial runs in a series where he had seemed destined to be a bystander? Or Ben Stokes, now the ultimate team man, who delivered the most stunning inidual performance of the series, or any series? Or the glittering impact of Jofra Archer, the bloody-mindedness and resolution of Stuart Broad, Josh Hazlewood and Rory Burns? Or the recall of Jack Leach – for all the hype it is the quality of his bowling that bodes well for the future.For some, primarily all the opening batsmen except Burns, it will seem like a car-crash series. Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Jason Roy might wonder whether they will ever reappear in this format David Warner will, though when he does he will be relieved if he finds someone other than Broad running towards him. The curmudgeons can complain about the quality of the play throughout – though this could never legitimately apply to the bowling – but the simple fact is that those who had access to this series revelled in the contest and characters.Leach may be the only England player with an active role left this season. He would like to play in Somerset’s last match of the season “if selected” against Essex at Taunton, which may well decide the destination of the Championship pennant. The rest of them can put their feet up and ponder an amazing summer.A stunning, fortuitous World Cup victory and a drawn Ashes series is not the perfect outcome – that might have warranted an honorary knighthood for Trevor Bayliss and we do not want any more wrangling of that sort. But it is not a bad result. Among those at the top of the ECB your correspondent may be regarded as a bit of a curmudgeon for his curious lack of enthusiasm for a 2020 summer, in which two short-form competitions dominate in June, July and August. Yet any sacrifices for a World Cup win, even if they included a diminished Ashes campaign, were worthwhile.Of course it was never a straightforward, binary choice between the World Cup and the Ashes. But nothing was spared in pursuit of that victory in July the Australians, five-times World Cup winners, were a bit cagier. England’s World Cup winners were not at their best at the start of the Ashes series and the team played their best cricket at the Oval. But the stark fact is that England have a far stronger, more settled ODI team than Test side, which still possesses several frailties (most obviously they do not score enough runs). Advancing that Test side will now be the challenge for Bayliss’s successor. Whoever it may be has a big hat to fill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c884dfca1736e4c62772df6448752a10194c3ba4/770_2340_1072_643/master/1072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6ad0c90e19d876dfb4c5ef492b0d939","title":"raf injury rugby league army","story":"• Scott Stevenson hurt in inter-services game against the army• ‘This is tragic and heartbreaking news,’ says RFL chiefAn RAF senior aircraftman has died after being injured playing in an inter-services rugby league match against the army.Scott Stevenson was hurt playing in the game at Aldershot last Friday night and news of his death was announced by his family in a Facebook post on Monday evening.

They will not be everybody’s, if anybody’s, favourites to win the World Cup. Their poor track record in recent years will not inspire much confidence. And, of course, they have lost one of their highest-profile players, Israel Folau, whose sacking over homophobic social media comments and subsequent legal action remain an enormous distraction. New Zealand, England, Wales, Ireland and South Africa are all rated ahead of the men in gold, but if history is any guide, the Wallabies will be contenders, and serious ones at that. The Wallabies have a rich history at the World Cup. They have won the tournament twice, played in the final four times, appeared in the semi-finals six times and failed to advance beyond the quarter-finals on only two occasions. Along with New Zealand and France, Australia have competed in the knockout stages of every World Cup since its inception in 1987. The wide open nature of this year’s tournament suits a team who are always there or thereabouts. Their coach, Michael Cheika, will be looking to enhance his reputation as a World Cup specialist. He took Australia from sixth in the world to the World Cup final in 2015, losing to the All Blacks. But after those unexpected heights they crashed back down to earth. The 2018 season was their worst since 1958 and there were calls for Cheika to go. Rugby Australia kept faith with him, if only because they thought it was impractical to change the head coach so late in the World Cup cycle. Cheika will believe, having done it once, he can do it again. With the departure of the attack coach Stephen Larkham, Cheika recreated the Wallabies’ style in his own abrasive, confrontational image. He has devised a gameplan based around brutality and brilliance. The linchpin of the strategy is the powerful inside-centre Samu Kerevi, whose primary role is to get the Wallabies across the advantage line. Every top team in the world – with the notable exception of Australia – is employing a rush defence. The use of the strong-running Kerevi, coupled with big ball-carrying forwards, is designed to negate that defensive tactic. Once across the advantage line, they play the old Randwick flat-line attack to put maximum pressure on the defence. The Wallabies executed their new strategy with mixed results in the Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup series. Their 47-26 win over the All Blacks in Perth and their 36-0 loss to the Kiwis in Auckland a week later showed what they are capable of – and what they are not. They have the size and strength to carry out their plan, but not always the skill and the discipline. Importantly though, Australia’s new approach is suitable to the attritional nature of World Cup rugby. If they can get past Fiji and Wales in the pool stage, they will secure a more favourable passage in the knockout stages. You may or may not expect the Wallabies to win the World Cup, but you should expect them to be among the contenders when the big games are played at the end of the tournament – they almost always are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f3eb3c8735ffe02feab21384e6db345481ff7f6/0_844_3643_2185/master/3643.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3cd4daa1175d245fbdd1a717c08ab2e","title":"how count arthur strong conquered comedy interview steve delaney tour","story":"As the dyspeptic old-school entertainer embarks on a tour, his creator Steve Delaney reflects on dedicating his life to one characterComedy has its careerists: thrusting tyros zeroing in on the fame, the TV gigs, the movie roles. But there are other, more circuitous routes to the top. The fictional Count Arthur Strong certainly took one, via the dog days of vaudeville and bit parts in Hammer horrors. His creator Steve Delaney took one too, meandering from drama school to a carpentry career to the slow gestation of his alter ego, away from the circuit’s bright lights.The Count is a star now his sitcom – co-written with Graham Linehan – ran for three series to 2017. But he was once an oddity on the Edinburgh fringe, where I started watching him at the turn of the century – an experience never to be forgotten, for various reasons. Yes, this blithering, dyspeptic old-school entertainer was a creation of near-genius, and Delaney’s blood vessel-busting performance a spectacle to behold. But – wow! – those early shows could be gruelling. The joke was in Arthur’s frustration and confusion, as his own waning powers (of memory, movement, syntax) thwarted this or that overreaching set piece. Often, Delaney took that joke to painful, patience-fraying extremes.I laughed, I winced – and I watched as other audience members walked out. (“Three quarters getting it and a quarter not,” says Delaney now: “That works for me!”) I certainly didn’t peg Count Arthur as a national treasure in waiting – his BBC One sitcom twice Bafta-nominated, his radio show multi-award-winning, his national tours a fun-for-all-the-family hot ticket. “I always thought Arthur would work in a sitcom,” Delaney tells me. “I never had any question about the various things he would work in. I believe in the character.”And so he should: it’s his life’s work. Delaney is 64 now, and – chatting at his publicist’s HQ before another UK tour – he’s looking good on it. A gentle chap with a naive air about him, he’s grown into Arthur, whom he dreamed up in the 80s. Delaney was studying at Central School of Speech and Drama, and needed an act for a circus-themed cabaret. Arthur was a sort-of strongman competing with Dracula to take bites out of a Bible. “It was very embryonic,” Delaney recalls. “He had the voice I used to lapse into anyway when I was arsing about. With this act, I was arsing about in a circus, so I just used that voice.”And what a voice it is. Northern (Delaney’s from Leeds, the son of a foundryman and a seamstress), wheedling, malaprops a-go-go. “I didn’t get wherever I am by not knowing where I am.” “If this turns into a full bowl of cashews, it could chiropidise the whole show. With my feet!” (I could go on. I’d love to go on.) He is hair-trigger touchy – a trait Delaney claims to share. “I often overreact to innocent questions, immediately thinking it’s to do with something I haven’t done. That defence mechanism is big up north. It was prolific in my family.” It makes for great comedy. “Everyone likes that Arthur says what he thinks. Immediately. It goes through no filter.”But beyond the cantankerousness, the Count is indomitable. “He’s a great optimist. He’s always on the lookout for the next thing. ‘We’ll get three of those, and I’ll set a market stall up.’ I love that about him,” says Delaney, “perhaps because it’s unlike me.”And yet, it took initiative for Delaney to make a success of the Count. He was a bit-part actor in the 80s (Juliet Bravo, All Creatures Great and Small), and a joiner on the side. The jobs overlapped: he was sitcom star Geoffrey Palmer’s carpenter of choice. Not until 15 years after drama school did he revive the Count for the comedy stage – after which instant success, he quit acting immediately. “At drama college,” he says now, “I learned that I wasn’t versatile. I didn’t have the application you need to change what you do every time you do something. If I had a performance in me, it was about homing in on something in a very meticulous way.”And that’s what Delaney did – far from well-trodden comedy paths. “I would hire venues. I’d put my own evenings on. I’d virtually print the tickets myself.” After six years, he quit carpentry too, and Arthur “became my living. I come from a generation where you have to have a job. And Arthur’s my job that’s very much how I treat it.” Even today, he professes no interest in taking on other roles. “I’m not interested in being an actor” – unlike Steve Coogan, say, to whose Alan Partridge the Count is often compared. But really, there’s no analogy to be drawn, no other comic who’s dedicated a lifetime to just one character.But why this character? “There are no others that could have come out of me,” says Delaney. “They say write about what you know. Well, when I was a kid in the 60s, a lot of stuff on TV was transitioning from the collapse of variety theatre. Light entertainment was fantastic: The Arthur Haynes Show, The Army Game, Bootsie and Snudge. And I place Arthur right on that transition period.” It’s a moment laced with melancholy Count Arthur has a dark side. “When music hall was breathing its last gasp is when Arthur started getting into it. Beautifully mistimed. So he’s always been chasing it.”Delaney won’t be drawn on whether the forgetful Count is a portrait in senility rather than mere dottiness. “I steer clear of it. For me, there’s nothing funny in coming up with a character with dementia. The best way I can describe Arthur is, he’s a nutty old bloke. In the way people were allowed to be nutty when I was a kid. ‘Don’t go near him, he’s mad.’ People don’t grow old in the same way any more. Mind you,” he says, “even when he was young, Arthur was like that.”At any rate, the character’s variety roots show in his stage work, where routine after routine (the ventriloquist’s Egyptian dummy his lederhosen-clad Sound of Music tribute or the silent comedy set-piece in which his stooges dress him as Sherlock Holmes) would grace the end of any pier. Then there are the moments that splice hilarity with agony – like the Count’s caterwauling rendition of Bill Withers’ Lovely Day in his last show The Sound of Mucus. Playing Arthur for two-and-a-half hours on stage – clenched, inflexible, barking – looks like a physical endurance test. Is it?“I never feel that, no. I know it’s hard: I was dizzy at the end of Lovely Day, wobbling around. But if Arthur would be on his knees at the end of it, then I want to be on my knees as a performer. It might hurt in the moment, but not after the show. And besides,” he says, “those moments people call excruciating, I love them.”There may be fewer of them these days – although Delaney insists he never toned down the character. “Some fans of the radio show didn’t like the TV show, and thought it was a watered-down version. But to me, they’re just different stories, different sides of Arthur – but the same approach from me.” Whatever the approach, it’s secured for Delaney an audience far wider than he expected. “When I was at the London Palladium, doing pantomime,” he tells me, “I was having a chat with Bobby Davro. And he said to me, ‘You are mainstream. You sell venues out’.” Delaney was puzzled by this then, and still is. “I like doing things on my own terms too much. I don’t regard what I do as mainstream at all.”But what’s thrilling about Count Arthur’s success is it proves you can be both. Experimental and popular. Eccentric and mainstream. Successful, and diffident about success. In the Count’s case, that success shows no signs of waning, with new TV projects in development (on which he is sworn to secrecy), a foray into publishing (with semi-coherent thriller Codename Rattlesnake) and a new tour (Is There Anybody Out There?, about stargazing) all in the pipeline. Of the latter, Delaney tells me: “I’m itching to perform again as Arthur now. I’ve spent enough time writing as him, I need to get out there and do it. You always think, ‘I wonder if I can still do it?’ – and I know the answer to that question, of course I do. But I enjoy having to prove it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b232ccd860be4d628bd0d702d427eaead66d04/0_131_2301_1380/master/2301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5266a02130f8824d25f954638748c84e","title":"via ferrata tour the dolomites northern italy","story":"Northern Italy’s iron paths give hikers the chance to feel like mountaineers but without rope, anchors or knots. Our writer straps in for the high-altitude thrill of his lifeI am standing on an enormous limestone plateau almost 3km up, peering over the edge of a cliff that seems to plunge all the way to the centre of the Earth. Behind me in the distance are stratified towers of rock, their tips gleaming through wisps of cloud in the morning sun. And in front of me is this breathtaking drop, the gateway to what our guide Alessio calls “the danger zone”.Alessio stands on the edge, beckons us nearer, then says: “We’re going to have fun in here.” And over we go, white-faced and silent, feeling like we’re leaping out of a plane. But instead our boots crunch down onto a concealed ledge that rapidly leads to a heart-pounding procession of cables, rungs and ladders banged into the sheer sides of the rock, all of which have turned this soaring, rippling cliff into one giant vertical adventure park. The white faces soon turn red and sweaty, the silence gives way to gasps and loud exclamations.This descent, the most exhilarating of my life, was a whole new way of experiencing the Dolomites, that magnificent mountain range in northern Italy. We had walked right through this spellbinding landscape the year before, from north to south. But now, instead of heading for the passes, we were tackling the lofty peaks – an endeavour only made possible by what may well be Italy’s greatest gift to the planet: its extraordinarily numerous and utterly electrifying via ferrata routes.Via ferrata translates as “the way of iron”, which is what these climbing aids were made of when they were first fixed to rock faces during the first world war, when Italian and Austrian troops fought ferocious battles on these mountains. Today they’re made of steel – and superbly maintained. On this spectacular stretch, known as the Francesco Berti, the via ferrata opened up what would otherwise have been a preposterously treacherous descent down, through, under and across smooth slabs, notched ridges, spiky outcrops and tottering ledges that can quickly thin to nothing. The drop was about 1km. The thrill was immeasurable.Via ferrata works like this: you wear a harness with two leashes, each bearing a sturdy quick-release clip at the end. These you attach to the cable, always keeping at least one latched on. And that’s just about all there is to learn. There are no ropes to lug around no nuts, hexes or other fiddly anchors to fasten to the rock no elaborate knots to master. If you fall, the cable will catch you before you drop too far, and there’s a built-in shock absorber to stop you snapping in half, just in case.At the start, I was seeking out holds, thinking this would provide a more authentic experience, letting me feel at one with the mountain. But after about 10 minutes, I was completely at one with the cable, gripping it with both fists and even my knees – particularly when, after one ill-judged stretch, I slowly spun through 180 degrees and found myself facing outwards, feet dangling in thin air, gazing at nothing but blue skies and distant summits. The cable, I realised, is there to be grabbed.When people gasp at your photographs, at those giddying images of you nonchalantly hanging off a pinnacle nosing up into the stratosphere, you have to fight the urge to blurt out: “It’s actually not that hard!” We’re not even climbers. We’re hillwalkers. And we’re pretty rubbish. The four of us have got lost on every big peak in the Scottish Highlands, and plenty of small ones too.But there we were on the Giro del Sorapiss – a grade three route, according to Cicerone’s guidebook, on a scale that rises to six – each feeling like Spider-Man as we scaled up, down and along its via ferrata sections. You just get a huge amount of high-altitude bang for your buck: the chance to feel like a real mountaineer while soaking up those stunning views. From isolated peaks to sprawling saw-toothed ranges, everywhere you look there’s yet another cross-hatched, vertical colossus – all formed of fossilised coral reef thrust up from the seabed 50 million years ago when Italy battered into Europe. Corbusier called the Dolomites the greatest architecture on Earth and we were right in the heart of it.The rock formed by this tumult is perfect for climbing, which is one of the reasons why the Dolomites have the world’s highest concentration of via ferrata routes, roughly 170. But there is a downside: the routes are understandably popular, especially in summer when crowds and queues can detract from their wild character. That’s why it was great to make our debut on Sorapiss, a longer, more out-of-the-way route. The epic circuit (or giro) takes two days and includes a lengthy pair of practically sheer via ferratas: the Alfonso Vandelli lifts you up high on the first day the Francesco Berti spins you back down on the second. “We won’t see many people today,” said Alessio as we set off. “This route is wild.”The Giro del Sorapiss is also a terrific introduction to the world of refuges, those magical hostels that pepper the trails and are a vital part of any Dolomites trip, allowing you to venture far into the mountains, hiking from hut to splendidly located hut. Some are well-equipped, others more cramped and basic, but all are unfailingly welcoming, right down to the window-boxes spilling over with alpine blooms.You may get the odd remote refuge that lacks showers and hot water, but they’ll still manage to bring you mounds of freshly grated parmesan with every hot and hearty meal, and a pair of fancy slippers or Crocs to change into the moment you arrive and wearily pull off your boots.We arrived in Venice, drove two hours north into the Dolomites, parked in a layby, then hiked up for an hour or so to stay first at Rifugio Vandelli, one of the more spartan refuges but very friendly. It is here that the Giro del Sorapiss begins, by a turquoise lake ringed by dwarf pine. There was a mood of trepidation in the tavern that night: maps and tips were nervously exchanged, but people kept largely to themselves, quietly playing cards and nipping out to catch the glorious sunset before turning in early.The next night at Rifugio San Marco – a gorgeous cuckoo clock of a refuge swaddled by mountains – it was party time. “How did you get on?” yelled Ed, a 65-year-old New Yorker who was walking the circuit with his son. “Did you get caught in the hail?” As we sank our beers in the garden’s fading light, we told Ed we’d dodged the brief burst of afternoon hail by sheltering under a ledge, but had then got trapped there by a flash flood cascading down the mountainside. Alessio had to rope us together and lead us through the gap behind the torrent, which would have swept away anyone in its path.“No!” said Ed, eyes popping. He ran off to tell his son before dashing back to add: “Hey, have you guys tried the solar-powered showers? They’re outdoor and unisex – very European! And the water’s warm enough to be pleasant.”He was right. Besides the hail, we’d had nothing but searing sun all day. But when my turn came to shower, a snap electrical storm suddenly descended, lighting up the peaks all around me in flash after flash. It might not have been the wisest idea, to stand under water pouring from a metal faucet on a tree-lined mountainside as lightning blazed, but I wouldn’t have missed that shower, or lovely family-run San Marco, for anything.In the bar later, the refuge’s guitar was passed around and, as an enthusiastic cross-language singsong developed, a group of Italian hikers began doing magic tricks and asking us for Scottish tunes. Platefuls of steaming goulash and bolognese soon followed, rounded off with sublime strudel, grappa by the ladleful, and louder singing.Alessio had been wary when I first floated the idea of finishing our via ferrata odyssey with a Dolomites classic: the mighty Punta Anna, a hair-raising grade five route right up the face of Tofana di Mezzo, which rises ridiculously steeply to a whopping 3,244 metres. But having been with us on Sorapiss, he relented and, after a short drive and a hike, we found ourselves strolling into Rifugio Pomedes, near the Punta Anna starting point.A much larger refuge, Pomedes couldn’t match San Marco for charm, but it did have compensations: en suite rooms a menu boasting beetroot gnocchi brushed with poppy-seed butter and a stuffed squirrel doing via ferrata up its foyer walls. “Your face looks familiar,” we overheard one climber say to another out on the terrace. “Didn’t we meet on the Matterhorn?” Clearly, we had entered another level.In the morning, the route – exposed, airy and a good deal more technical – shot us straight up the cliffside, with big reaches, crazy drops, sketchy footholds, and quite a few heart-stopping sticking points. After the five most adrenaline-fuelled hours of our lives, we reached the top of Punta Anna and broke out the whisky for a celebratory nip in the rarefied air.Accommodation Dorm beds at Rifugio Vandelli start at €52, Rifugio San Marco €53, Rifugio Pomedes €60 (all half-board).Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She added that some of the roads “don’t have the tarmac on,” while a number of homes had “major problems” that needed to be put right. Several are still covered in scaffolding.Porter added that many of the benefits HAB promised to the community, including allotments, an orchard, a cycle path and two electric cars with charging points, had yet to be delivered.“There’s a building site where the orchard and allotments should be,” said Porter, a county and city councillor who lives less than two miles from the site. She added she did not want “the public purse” to have to pay for “HAB’s mess-up”.HAB has not denied there have been problems but added it had been carrying out work on the houses and providing frequent progress updates.The claims relating to the development in Kings Worthy, near Winchester in Hampshire, deal a fresh blow to the Channel 4 presenter, whose property empire has been hit by financial problems.On 10 September it emerged that attempts to restructure the HAB Land bonds had failed, despite the investors having been effectively warned that if they did not back the proposals, HAB Land was at risk of being wound up or falling into insolvency. The directors of the company said they were considering their “next steps”.McCloud set up HAB Housing – the “HAB” stands for “Happiness Architecture Beauty” – in 2007, and then HAB Land in 2014.Lovedon Fields is a 50-home development with prices originally starting at £467,500. It received planning permission in 2015 and, according to Porter, it was originally due to be completed in 2017, though this was later pushed back to the following year.It is understood the first residents moved on to the site in mid-2017. But in March 2019, following a newspaper article that highlighted problems at the development, McCloud acknowledged residents had received a “poor service,” adding: “I’m personally very sorry for the delays and problems caused… and I am putting a plan in place to fix them.”More than six months on, locals claim there is still a catalogue of problems to deal with. A nearby resident said: “The financial scandal for bondholders is only one half of the story – the other is the more human and as awful: the poor house owners left with totally unfinished roadssiteamenities.”He added that the biggest worry was that locals could be left with “a bomb site of a legacy to gaze upon, let alone all the snaggingrepairs that need doing on the houses themselves”.“It’s very disappointing and could cost the community a lot to put the dreadful state of the site to rights, but I’m determined it should not be a public expense,” added Porter.In a statement, a HAB Land spokesperson said: “With regard to our Lovedon Fields development, understandably, we have been prioritising works on the houses of our homebuyers which we have been diligently undertaking. Throughout this process we have been in continual dialogue with our homebuyers, the parish and city councils, and other stakeholders, with frequent updates on progress and planned activities.”The spokesperson added that the directors were continuing to explore and evaluate all options after the vote put to bondholders did not pass."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e711cbec2d8f5eca0d9b4fa16b2f07d2c4683d4c/0_0_3279_1968/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b64c816fe1b217e7ab630e3aeb81439","title":"tv tonight a tumble in the hay with love in the countryside","story":"Sara Cox helps seven singles find romance in the midst of running busy farms.

It was due to visit Mangonui, in the North Island, but the stop was cancelled by the ministry of culture and heritage after complaints from indigenous figures.“He didn’t discover anything down here, and we object to Tuia 250 using euphemisms like ‘encounters’ and ‘meetings’ to disguise what were actually invasions.”In Gisborne, nearly 800km from Mangonui down the east coast and the starting point for the flotilla’s months-long voyage, iwi said they would refuse to hold pōwhiri, or welcoming ceremonies, for those ships linked to colonisation.Tamsin Evans, the ministry for culture and heritage’s deputy chief executive, said the government had heeded iwi concerns, and the flotilla would stop only at communities “where a welcome is clear”.“We know there are groups of people that have strong feelings. Tuia 250 is a commemoration in which we can have honest conversations about our history,” she said.Tensions have been rising for more than a year before the planned celebrations. In Gisborne, the council decided to remove a statue of Cook after it was repeatedly vandalised.Cook and the crew of the Endeavour landed in Gisborne’s Poverty Bay in 1769 and the first significant meetings of Europeans and Māori took place nearby. The name Poverty Bay has in itself caused controversy – its original name was Tūranganui-a-Kiwa before being renamed by Cook.In March, the Cook Islands considered changing its name to respect its indigenous heritage, with Avaiki Nui an early frontrunner. The name “must have a taste of our Christian faith, and a big say on our Māori heritage. And it must instil a sense of pride in our people, and unite our people,” Danny Mataroa, chair of the name change committee, told RNZ Pacific.“If you read through his own journals and the journals of the crew members, it was not uncommon for him to shoot at us, to steal from us, for abductions to happen, and in fact whole communities were wiped out through sexually transmitted diseases.”Herbert-Graves said the ministry had not consulted the iwi before placing Mangonui on the Tuia 250 itinerary.Tamsin Evans, the ministry’s deputy chief executive, said talks had been with a single iwi representative at the Doubtless Bay Promotions Trust and hoped most people still wanted to take part.On Tuesday, a traditional double-hulled sailing canoe arrived in Tauranga from Tahiti after a trip lasting nearly four weeks. Traditional navigation methods were used to guide the Fa’afaite to the North Island in honour of navigator Tupaia, who mediated between Māori communities and the crew of the Endeavour.Bernadette Cavanagh at the culture ministry said: “The Tuia 250 national commemoration highlights the stories of Tupaia which have often been overshadowed in our history by the feats of James Cook.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f0185a0c95ecfda1a45b6c430a4651d297ab9b1/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=155f6926bd5d275db3cfa594fc9b09ec","title":"israel election voters head to the polls for second time this year","story":"Netanyahu campaign has demonised Israel’s Arab minority and vowed to annex much of Palestinian territoriesIsrael elections: everything you need to knowIsraelis have begun voting in the country’s second election this year, following a campaign dominated by Benjamin Netanyahu and his vows to implement a far-right, ultranationalist agenda in exchange for a record fifth term as leader.Facing the prospect of criminal corruption indictments and hoping to extend his unmatched stint in the prime minister’s office, Netanyahu has promised to declare up to a third of the occupied Palestinian territories as part of Israel if he is re-elected.His campaign also demonised Israel’s large Arab minority as a fifth column that endangers the country, allied itself with the extremist Jewish Power faction, and warned that the election could be stolen by fraud in Arab areas. And Netanyahu last week reportedly considered a major military operation against Gaza.“Citizens of Israel, we find ourselves at the high point of a historic change in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel,” the 69-year-old prime minister wrote in the Maariv newspaper on Monday.He claimed he had spent the past three decades fighting to keep Israel’s military presence in the Palestinian territories despite “the pressures of the Clinton and Obama administration”.“I am now asking for your confidence so as to complete this historic task and to fortify the State of Israel’s borders and security forever.”Asked if that included the hundreds of Jews who live under heavy military guard amid tens of thousands of Palestinians in Hebron, Netanyahu responded: “Of course.”More than 6.3 million people are eligible to vote at polling stations that will close at 10pm (8pm BST) on Tuesday, after which exit polls will be reported.With a razor-thin margin expected between Netanyahu and his main rival, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, an inconclusive result where neither has a clear path to forming a coalition government is a potential outcome. That deadlock could plunge Israel into another political crisis, with the prospect of weeks of tense deal-making or even a third election.Gantz, a security hawk who focused his campaign on Netanyahu’s alleged corruption and anti-democratic moves, also wrote in Monday’s edition of Maariv, slamming the prime minister for “spins and telling lies”.The former head of the army, who describes himself as a centrist but also supports annexing Palestinian land, promised he would employ “disproportionate force” to fight off frequent rocket attacks from Gaza.“Blue and White under my leadership will change the direction of the ship of state of Israeli democracy,” he said.As with every Israeli election, security has been a key issue, with Netanyahu’s opponents attempting to paint him as indecisive and conflict-averse. When the prime minister was whisked away by his security team at a campaign event during a Palestinian militant rocket attack from Gaza, Netanyahu’s political foes jumped on the incident to portray him as weak.The local Haaretz newspaper reported on Monday that later that night, Netanyahu had considered launching a significant military operation in Gaza, one that may have delayed the election, but was advised against it. The government denied the report.Israel is holding a repeat election just five months after the last one. This time, all eyes will be on Avigdor Lieberman, Netanyahu’s former right-hand man, whose refusal to join a coalition government with Jewish ultra-Orthodox parties in May led to a cascade of events that resulted in the second vote.His staunchly secular stance against religious politicians appears to have drawn support from the nonreligious right wing, and he could come out as the kingmaker who decides Israel’s next prime minister.Lieberman wants Netanyahu to form a unity government with the opposition, but Gantz has ruled out serving with him. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history, is also very unlikely to sit in a government headed by anyone but himself.In preparation for election day, the military will close crossings with the occupied West Bank, where more than 2.5 million Palestinians live under Israeli rule but cannot vote, and Gaza, where 2 million more live under a blockade.As in previous elections, Netanyahu has warned of defeat at the hands of politicians from Israel’s Arab minority and “leftists” in an attempt to boost rightwing turnout. Last week, Facebook temporarily shut down a chatbot on his official page for breaching the company’s hate speech policy after it warned of Arabs who “want to destroy us all”.Israel’s Arab parties could win significant votes after reunifying into a single alliance, similar to 2015 when they became the third-largest force in the Knesset. It is possible they could gather enough seats to block Netanyahu’s premiership."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc6706ca9d2b91cb676db8d1e76d51e3db36fb5b/0_195_6140_3685/master/6140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2279cb996d400bfadbd98c64a814887f","title":"metoo conference hopes to relegate harassment to history","story":"Three-day gathering will explore why movement gained traction and effect it has hadThe first major international conference exploring the #MeToo movement is taking place in Reykjavik on Tuesday, hosted by the Icelandic prime minister, who said she hoped it would contribute to “relegating sexual harassment to history”.The three-day gathering will explore why the movement first gained traction, and the effect it has had across different countries and sectors. Women with disabilities, care workers and migrant women whose voices have not typically been heard since the movement began as a hashtag in October 2017 will be among the participants from around the world to share their stories, and discuss how to keep up the momentum to tackle sexual abuse and assault.The prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, told the  that the conference was intended to “create a platform for an international and in-depth conversation about the impact and the future of #MeToo”.She added: “The movement revealed epidemic levels of sexual and gender-based harassment and abuse that women across society and the world are exposed to. We owe it to all those women, to the women who couldn’t speak up and to future generations, to create policies and push for transformative change, so that the realities unveiled by #MeToo will soon belong to the history books.”Eighty panelists are scheduled to appear, including Purna Sen, the UN’s spokeswoman on addressing sexual harassment, the American political activist Angela Davis, Catherine Mayer, co-founder of the UK’s Women’s Equality party, the playwright Justina Kehinde and the positive masculinity campaigner Gary Barker.Halla Gunnarsdóttir, the Icelandic government’s adviser on gender equality, and one of the main organisers of the conference, said #MeToo Moving Forward would analyse what it revealed about different countries, including the USA and Britain, where it has been explosive since the emergence of sexual abuse allegations against the film producer Harvey Weinstein, which he denies, as well as in the Nordic countries where it has dominated headlines.The conference organisers hoped to produce a communique of concrete proposals “if and when we come up with them,” she said.“We want to expand the conversation, to listen to the voices we haven’t yet heard, including those with more insecure employment whose status might have affected their ability to file a complaint, including women in low-skilled, low-paid professions, care workers, domestic workers, migrant workers, disabled women, who have often not been able to organise themselves in the same way that others have.“We want to look at the themes that run across these groups, including consent, justice and the backlash.”The idea for the conference started 18 months ago as “a tiny idea in my head,” Halla said. Invitations were sent out to a range of potential speakers with 50 originally expected to attend. “But almost everyone we asked said yes, so it’s much bigger than we expected with people telling us they welcomed the possibility to discuss this, and just this, in a concentrated way over three days.”More than 800 participants have registered to attend – almost twice as many as expected. It is free of charge, and panel discussions will be livestreamed.#MeToo Moving Forward is taking place under the auspices of the Nordic Council of Ministers, the presidency of which Iceland currently holds. Women’s rights have long been at the heart of the politics of Katrín, who became Iceland’s second female prime minister almost two years ago. It is also core part of the Left-Green movement to which she belongs.Halla said surprise had been expressed that Iceland, like all Nordic countries often viewed as exemplary for its social welfare policies, was choosing to host the event, after the most publicised #MeToo scandals had taken place in the USA and Britain.“We felt that we’re obliged to hold it. Iceland is often seen as the number one in the world, receiving constant recognition for its strong welfare system and equal rights and held up as a gender equality utopia. But we thought: ‘If this is as good as it gets it’s not good, is it?’” she said.#MeToo had revealed many cases of systemic harassment in non-unionised jobs in Iceland, she said, and thousands of women had taken to Facebook to share their stories. “We had hoped it did not happen here, until we started talking about it and found out it did,” she said.In Sweden the focus has mainly been on the Swedish Academy, home to the Nobel prize, which was beset with sexual harassment claims involving its former head. Sex workers in Sweden have also been among those to speak out. In Norway, the #MeToo revelations have largely played out in the political world.“What #MeToo did was to bring the conversation into every lunch-break in every office, where everyone started talking about what happened to them and sharing their stories, it suddenly opened a Pandora’s box,” Halla said.“But we’re still looking into what #MeToo actually is. Is it a revolution? A subversion? Just a small window of opportunity, or something bigger? What I’m hoping is that this conference helps to keep the momentum going, and if there’s a backlash that it helps us to challenge that backlash.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020086.1568664739!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catholic school backs homework pass for attending religious event","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe mother of the boy said she was advised by the school that if she was not happy she had other “options”.

I run a business.’  Photograph: Patrick BrowneMany parents are finding it “impossible” to opt-out their children from religion classes despite their legal right to do so, according to campaigners.Under both the Constitution and the Education Act (1998), parents have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes if they wish. A spokesman for the Department of Education confirmed this was the case and said practical arrangements to accommodate children whose parents have chosen this option is a matter for each inidual school. However, the campaign group Atheist Ireland claims it is aware of dozens of cases where parents have been told the subject is a core subject and the right to opt-out should not arise. “It’s like the public services card – it’s mandatory, but not compulsory,” said Jane Donnelly of Atheist Ireland. “If you do manage to opt your child out, they’re given no other subject and you’re asked why do you want to do this. Parents are questioned as to their reason. It’s like a form of coercion.”Ciara Roosli from Tramore, Co Waterford, said she requested in writing on two occasions that her son be exempt from religion at Ardscoil na Mara.CompulsoryHowever, she says she was told verbally that religion was compulsory at the school and the only solution was to remove him from the premises or to go to another school. There is no other secondary school in the town. “I had to go and take my child out of the school during religion class as I’ve been told that he has no choice but to take the subject,” she said.“I fully respect the school and its ethos. But pupils should not have to relinquish their human and constitutional rights.“I can’t continue to take him out of the school. I run a business. I can’t do that three times a week.”Ardscoil na Mara’s religious policy describes the school as being “immersed in the Edmund Rice (ERST) and the Religious Sisters of Charity traditions” and being “committed to developing the full potential of each student, within a welcoming Christian atmosphere”.It says its official policy is that religious education is regarded as “an integral part of our programme and a very important subject throughout school”. The policy adds that it respects the rights of parents who require that their child be excluded from religious education.One option is that a parent should remove their child from the school premises for the duration of religious education.Another option, according to its policy, is staying within the classroom following an “educationally appropriate activity” but cannot include study or homework.The school principal, Pádraig Cawley, declined to comment on the inidual case, but said the school promoted inclusivity and was always available to meet with parents to resolve any issues.He said the school policy on religious education was being reviewed and updated to reflect the new Junior Cycle specification for religion. This new religion course, which teaches about religions and beliefs, is not regarded as faith formation.‘Disrespects’According to the department, this subject is concerned with “understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and are designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none”. However, groups such as Atheist Ireland claim it “disrespects” the rights of parents who seek secular education for their children based on human rights. Principals in a number of Catholic schools insist they are highly inclusive and seek to integrate students from all faith traditions and none.They have pointed to ESRI and Department of Education inspectors’ reports, which have found an “ overwhelming majority of parents and students find their schools to be well-managed and welcoming”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Company says further 182 jobs could also in be danger before end of weekSecond day of disruption following a failed tram on Suir RoadDes Long says he sat opposite Adams at meetings of the IRA\u0026rsquos Army CouncilAtheist parent alleges son discriminated against for not attending Communion choirDepartment has written to Data Protection Commissioner outlining \u0026lsquoinconsistencies\u0026rsquoFire safety shortcomings estimated to cost \u0026euro11,000-\u0026euro14,000 per apartment to remedyWarning comes as Northern Secretary holds talks aimed at restarting Stormont assemblyApartments on sale for \u0026euro260,000, close to what they originally made at top of marketCompleted reconstruction of Dublin estate set to top five times original estimateLimits allow for budget-day package of \u0026euro2.8 billion, with \u0026euro2.1 billion already committedConstitution gives parents a right to withdraw their child from religion classesMinister for Children referred case to garda\u0026iacute in 2018 following whistleblower disclosureMore than 60 per cent of the population of Ireland live within 10 kilometres of the coastDepartment of Social Protection claims Dixon\u0026rsquos report has several \u0026lsquoinconsistencies\u0026rsquoVote was to be held in November but likely to be squeezed out by Brexit and by-electionsNigel Dodds says \u0026lsquobehind the soundbites\u0026rsquo it was clear work has been going onFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD criticises \u0026lsquopolicy of inertia\u0026rsquo on issue and believes link to Ictu should be exploredMan in his 50s is due in court on Tuesday after being arrested in the Artane areaProcessors says thousands of job losses are now inevitable due to blockadesNI judge hopes ruling on handling of Brexit process will be ready by end of month"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020623.1568705568!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"355 workers temporarily laid off from larry goodman plant","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tABP food group has confirmed that 355 of its workers have been temporarily let go from its plant at Cahir, Co Tipperary with a further 182 jobs threatened before the end of the week.ABP food group has confirmed that 355 of its workers have been temporarily let go from its plant at Cahir, Co Tipperary with a further 182 jobs threatened before the end of the week.The lay-offs are a result of ongoing blockades at the site, the company has said.“The protestors have stopped any product going in to or leaving the site.

Photograph: PA Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams’ assertion that he was never a member of the IRA is a “lie”, a former IRA leader has claimed in a new BBC TV series on the Troubles. Mr Adams has consistently denied that he was a member of the IRA. Des Long, who was on the IRA’s army executive for 17 years, says Mr Adams was the chairman of the IRA’s Army Council and sat opposite him at executive meetings. His interview is to be screened tonight as part of the second episode of Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History, a seven-part BBC Northern Ireland documentary investigating the Troubles. When presenter, Darragh MacIntyre, puts it to Mr Long that Mr Adams “wasn’t in the IRA”, Mr Long laughs. “You can’t be on the army council unless you’re a volunteer, and you can’t be chairman of the army council unless you’re a member of the army council, and I sat opposite him in meetings,” he responds. “That lie he comes out with that he was never in the IRA, that’s a lie, and I’m saying that now as having sat opposite him in meetings. I’ll probably get shot for it, but I’m saying it,” he adds. Earlier this year, Mr Adams told the inquest into the British army’s killing of 10 people in Ballymurphy in west Belfast in 1971 that: “I was not a member of the IRA, I have never disassociated myself with the IRA, and I never will, until the day I die.” In the programme, Mr McIntyre explains Mr Adams declined to take part in the series. He also says Mr Long fell out with Mr Adams in 1986 during a wider republican split. “I was aware that he was a highly intelligent man and that he had never used a pistol or thrown a bomb,” says Lord Ramsbotham, “but he was definitely a strategic planner of the highest order and I thought certainly he was directing the political direction of the IRA.” The episode begins in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, which the IRA anticipated would be its “year of victory”. It includes rediscovered footage which was filmed for an American documentary, The Secret Army, which shows a bomb attack being planned and carried out in Belfast, gunmen in Derry, and weapons classes for IRA recruits. It includes images of the planning and execution of a bomb attack on the Queen’s University Sports Hall in Belfast in May 1972, in which several people were hurt. The programme also reveals new details about the IRA ceasefire of 1975 which include the claim that Britain had agreed to discuss its withdrawal from Northern Ireland. But a document written by the most senior official in the Northern Ireland Office and uncovered by the BBC reveals the British plan was to weaken the IRA by “stringing them along”. The former commander of the IRA in Belfast, Billy McKee - who died earlier this year - said that “on the table was British withdrawal. They came to us, they sent for us at that time, we didn’t go to them,” he says. The IRA met with the British “over a dozen times”,” he explained. “I was convinced they were very serious.” The programme also reveals a secret British army report from 1978 on “Northern Ireland Future Terrorist Trends”, which concluded in 1978 that the IRA was “well equipped, more professional and capable of waging war for the foreseeable future.” The first programme in the series, which was broadcast last week, included claims that the former DUP leader Ian Paisley supplied money to the UVF to carry out a number of bombings in 1969. It also contains rare footage of the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, allegedly preparing a car bomb for an attack on Derry’s Guildhall in 1972.

Photograph: Nick BradshawBuilding defects at a large south Dublin apartment complex could cost up to €10 million to repair, according to an official fire safety audit.Bills of €11,000-€14,000 per apartment are estimated in the report, which examined 632 units at Simonsridge, Sandyford, which was built in 2006 by developer Shannon Homes.The management company passed its findings to Dublin Fire Brigade, and residents were asked to volunteer as fire wardens.A fire-safety audit prepared by Logical Real Estate Consulting was issued to owners in September. It details shortcomings found during two inspections of a sample of 10 apartments and common areas by chartered building surveyor Cathal Maher.He reported “a significant number of fire-safety deficiencies with workmanship and building materials”.The report estimates it will cost € 11,000-€ 14,000 (excluding VAT and professional fees) per apartment to carry out the remedial works, and another €25,000-€30,000 for each of the 32 stairwells. This equates to € 9.8 million for the entire block.In an email, the owners’ management company said that although it intends to raise funds to cover any remedial work in the common areas, it is “not in a position to compel people to undertake expensive works to their private property”.The report details “a number of fire-safety deficiencies” relating to means of escape and internal fire spread.The report states that “a fire could spread and breach the protected hallways within the apartments in less than 30 minutes”, which is the required length of time under the granted fire certificate.Inadequate fire-stoppingPipes passing through the compartment levels of apartments were not fitted with fire-rated collars, and “internal protected hallways do not extend to the underside of the concrete slab above”, according to the report.Services passing above the front door of the apartment units into the common area hallways were also not appropriately fire-stopped, nor were the ceilings of these hallways.There were no fire extinguishers found in any of the common areas that were surveyed. However, the emergency lighting, fire doors and smoke detection system in common areas were found to be in good condition in general.A spokeswoman for Dublin Fire Brigade said it had received a copy of the report and was “working with the management company to ensure compliance of fire safety issues”.“Dublin Fire Brigade will continue to monitor the situation,” the spokeswoman said.Managing agent KPM declined to comment, while Shannon Homes did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020089.1568665269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"spending increases beyond budget limits not possible departments told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will tell the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee it is “critical that the expenditure position for Budget 2020 is managed within the parameters set out in the mid-year expenditure report”. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Government departments have been warned there will be no extra money available in the budget over and above what has already been pledged. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has repeatedly criticised the recent pattern of the Government increasing spending despite budgetary restrictions.This has been mostly done to plug overruns in the Department of Health but officials have been warned that this is “not possible” for the forthcoming budget, due to be delivered on October 8th. Robert Watt, the secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has issued other secretaries general with the firm directive as preparations for the budget intensify. A key element of the approach, he says, is the management of 2019 spending and negotiations for the 2020 budget following spending limits already set out.His warnings will also be echoed by Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe at the Oireachtas Budgetary Oversight Committee today. Mr Watt’s letter said “it is not possible or appropriate to implement a budgetary package in excess” of that set out already in the mid-year expenditure report and the summer economic statement. Budget-day packageThey allow for a budget-day package of €2.8 billion, of which €2.1 billion has already been committed. These figures were reconfirmed by Mr Donohoe last week when he chose to prepare the budget for a no-deal Brexit. The comments from Mr Donohoe and Mr Watt will be seen as a warning to Minister for Health Simon Harris, in particular.Mr Donohoe’s opening statement to the Oireachtas budgetary committee says it is “critical that the expenditure position for Budget 2020 is managed within the parameters set out in the mid-year expenditure report”.Departments will be required to “re-prioritise spending” to deal with pressure for extra money and new policy initiatives, Mr Donohoe said. Health spending must be “proactively managed” to reduce the risk to the “risk to the public finances” of another spending overrun, he adds. Mr Watt also said “significant overruns” in what was budgeted for 2019 “would necessarily reduce the scope” for Budget 2020. “Where departments have pressures for additional expenditure, they must look to offset these pressures through re-prioritisation.Both Mr Watt and Mr Donohoe say that spending for this year is managed within the allocations agreed by the Government and the Dáil.If the UK leaves the European Union in an orderly fashion, the Government will run a small surplus of 0.4 per cent but this will swing to a deficit in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 per cent if there is no deal. Sectors of the economy seen as at risk from a no-deal Brexit at the end of October will be supported through greater Government borrowing.Mr Donohoe has said the €2.8 billion spend could increase if he decides to borrow more and sources said the €700 million available for new spending will be allocated on budget day. The vast majority of no-deal supports will then be funded through borrowing, it is understood, with Mr Donohoe providing a rough outline of such plans on budget day, rather than spending specifics.Mr Donohoe says “the scope for budgetary measures, outside the Brexit support package, is extremely constrained”.Mr Harris has already said there will be a supplementary estimate in the health sector, but said it will not be as high as 2018, when an additional €700 million had to be allocated. This was mostly funded through higher-than-expected corporation tax receipts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020072.1568663525!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public services card watchdog s full report to be published today","story":"The Department of Social Protection will on Tuesday afternoon publish the full investigation by the State’s data protection watchdog into the controversial public services card project.Until now, the department has held off on publishing the full report, but the Government has already signalled that it will be challenging the findings of the investigation, which was concluded and the findings sent to the department last month.The Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon found that several aspects of the card were unlawful.These included the retention of documents with personal data on 3.2 million citizens, which the commissioner said must be destroyed, as well as the basis for which the State demanded the card be used for a variety of services. A total of seven adverse findings were recorded by the report.Relations between the department and the data watchdog have soured arising from the report, with secretary general John McKeon last week writing to Ms Dixon to outline a series of alleged inconsistencies, as well as criticising the manner in which the investigation and its report were completed and publicised.The letter, which has been seen by The , was delivered by hand to Ms Dixon last week.It argues that there are inconsistencies between the report and a letter sent to the department alongside the report, as well as “internal inconsistencies”.One such alleged inconsistency relates to the ongoing processing of applications from outside the department. Another relates to the circumstances in which data gathered for the project should be deleted.Regarding this second point, the letter states: “These inconsistencies between the report and the letter make it unclear as to what actions are required of the department and calls into question whether or not the DPC itself has a clear understanding of the import of its own findings.”‘New finding’It also takes issue with the deletion of some findings from the draft report, which was sent to the department last year, as well as what Mr McKeon says is “at least one completely new finding”.“Altering the report in such a manner without giving the department an opportunity to comment is a breach of fair procedures,” Mr McKeon wrote.The letter also criticises the requirement issued by the commission that the department take certain actions within 21 days of being furnished with the report, which it says has “no particular legal force”.The secretary general also questions the “precise legal basis” for any forthcoming enforcement actions, given the fact that the Acts under which the report was conducted are no longer in place, having been superseded by the introduction of the GDPR regime in 2018.Mr McKeon is also critical of the commission’s rejection of a request made by Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty to meet to discuss the report. “Your characterisation of the Minister’s request for a meeting as seeking to negotiate in some manner with the DPC is a misunderstanding of the nature of the request.”The manner in which the commission handled the submission of the report also comes in for criticism. The watchdog has no powers to publish the report, but the department alleges that it “nevertheless published the core elements of the report” via a press release, media briefings and interviews.The Government insists the processing of personal data has a strong legal basis, the retention of data is lawful and the information provided to users does satisfy the requirements of transparency."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020069.1568663555!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"watchdog accused of procedures breach on public services card","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA report by Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon found that several aspects of how the public services card was used were unlawful.

If I don\u0027t earn the money, I won\u0027t be investing.“If I\u0027m not investing, that has a cumulative impact on jobs, on buying parts from suppliers, on the success of the company, on taxes we pay on everything.”Mr Flewitt also said he “hates the idea of a no-deal Brexit” due to the lack of clarity anyone can offer, describing it as “no-deal with no understanding of the consequences of no-deal”.He also said: “The politicians need to lead us.“Fine, if the country has mandated that we leave, and that\u0027s what we decide to do, but then their job is to make sure the rules, the guidelines, the processes are in place to manage that exit in an orderly way - not to damage, not to undermine the country because we didn\u0027t manage it well.“If the outcome isn\u0027t a great one that\u0027s a consequence of the fact we had a referendum and we voted to leave.“But for the consequence to be a damaging one because we don\u0027t manage it properly, that\u0027s downright irresponsible - and it won\u0027t just be supercars.“Your headlines won\u0027t be \u0027McLaren can\u0027t build supercars on 4 November.“It\u0027ll be we can\u0027t get medicines, we can\u0027t get food, we can\u0027t get clothes, the chaos that could ensue - because there won\u0027t be a differentiation between this component and that component coming in, cross-border trade - that\u0027s the bit I think is irresponsible, to lead us into that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Sheeran continued: “I’ve said yes to 90 per cent\u0026nbspof the features I’ve been personally asked for, unless I’ve been on a break or I haven’t known the artist personally.Sheeran added that he has a deep\u0026nbsprespect for the scene as well as for Wiley.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSheeran’s collaborations album features Eminem, Cardi B and Chance The Rapper. Drake was recently in London for the premiere of Top Boy\u0027s third series, which he produced.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, Libra differs from many cryptocurrencies as it is centralised in its nature against the founding member companies, in a similar way that fiat currencies are centralised against a central bank,” Ana\u0026nbspBencic, president of digital exchange\u0026nbspNexthash, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“Due to the ... circle of multi-billion dollar companies essentially managing their own currency, it is not surprising that central banks are cautious of money moving in this direction. It will be interesting to see the result of these talks and whether governments or Libra will make any adjustments to accommodate it within the online global economy.”The meeting in Basel, Switzerland, will involve representatives from the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve, according to officials who spoke with the\u0026nbspFinancial Times.Facebook previously said that it welcomes feedback from global regulators, claiming that it announced Libra long before its intended release date in order to address any potential issues.“In the nearly three months since the intent to launch the Libra project was announced, we have become the world’s most scrutinised fintech effort,” a spokesperson for Libra told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast week.“We welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations, educate stakeholders and incorporate their feedback in our design.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

More than 130 applications have been made to the US Commerce Department by companies hoping to sell goods and services to Huawei, but none have yet been granted.One billion Google calendar users exposed to fake invite scamThe ban on trading with the Chinese firm comes after concerns were raised by US government agencies that its devices could be used as spy tools by the Chinese state. Huawei has consistently denied these claims, and an escalating trade war between the US and China has not helped matters.Huawei has relied heavily in the past on US companies, particularly for software used in devices sold in US and European markets.Mr Yu previously said it was Huawei’s preference to continue working with US firms like Google in order to build its products.The Mate 30 will be launched on 19 September in Munich, with rumours suggesting it will feature more camera lenses and support 5G connectivity.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21.

I\u0027m not sure I\u0027d take bets on it right now - I really have no idea.”Mr Flewitt said it “isn\u0027t going to fundamentally undermine” McLaren if there are tariffs on cars into Europe as he outlined his lack of concern about what happens six to 12 months after a no-deal Brexit.He added: “But on day two and day three if we\u0027re struggling importing parts, if we\u0027re struggling exporting cars, if our employees are really concerned because they don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on, that kind of uncertainty could cause disruption for some weeks - and that\u0027s really not good.“For an independent company like us, you disturb our cash flow, you disturb our employee base, it\u0027ll have very, very serious ramifications.“What we really need is some certainty, some thinking.

What a waste of public money, and ours.”Mr Wright issued a Public Interest Intervention Notice in June following the purchase by Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel and Wondrous Investment Holdings of a 30 per cent shareholding in IDNM and a 30 per cent shareholding in LHL. IDNM is the publisher of The Independent, while LHL is the majority shareholder in publishers Evening Standard Ltd, and the two companies operate under the name ESI Media.In its report to the culture secretary, Ofcom said it could not rule out\u0026nbspthere may be “incentives and ability for the buyers to alter the accuracy or editorial stances of the publications”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have carried out a detailed analysis of a sample of the content of both publications before and after the transactions, and there has been no evidence or substantial claims of any influence in practice to date.\u0026nbsp“We cannot, of course, rule out any suggestion that the buyers might in future, perhaps with the other shareholders’ consent, seek to present more positive coverage of Saudi matters. However, this is a possibility in relation to other newspapers as well, for example\u0026nbspto any newspaper potentially seeking to expand overseas.”Although Ofcom noted that newspapers are not generally required to be transparent about their ownership, Ms Morgan voiced disappointment that neither company was willing to take further steps to address gaps in transparency and mitigate the risk of future inappropriate influence on editorial matters.\u0026nbspThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement: “Overall, the secretary of state’s conclusion is that Ofcom’s report goes a considerable way to satisfying her in relation to the public interest concerns relevant to this case, and based on Ofcom’s conclusions she would not have referred the case to a phase two\u0026nbspinvestigation.”In a statement, a spokesperson for ESI Media said: “We are pleased, but not at all surprised, that the secretary of state has agreed with the conclusions of the CMA and Ofcom. They both found that there were no grounds for the government to take further action in relation to the investments in The Independent and Evening Standard.“Ofcom said there was no evidence whatsoever of interference by the investors in our editorial operations. This was after a thorough investigation, including the analysis of thousands of published articles and a public consultation.\u0026nbsp“Ofcom considers the safeguards already in place to protect editorial freedom to be appropriate. Similarly, the CMA concluded that there was no need to pursue a further investigation on competition grounds.\u0026nbsp“We said at the outset that this enquiry was disproportionate and unwarranted and our position hasn’t changed. We continue to take the editorial independence of both our titles very seriously.”Competition and Markets Authority\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This phenomenon – known as “Shapiro Delay” – is because the gravity from the white dwarf star slightly warps the space surrounding it.\u0026nbspThis warping means the pulses from the rotating neutron star have to travel a little bit further. Astronomers measure that delay to calculate the mass of the white dwarf, which in turn provides a measurement of the neutron star. \u0026nbspOnce the mass of one of the co-orbiting bodies is known they can accurately determine the mass of the other.\u0026nbsp“The orientation of this binary star system created a fantastic cosmic laboratory,” said Scott Ransom, an astronomer at National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and co-author on the paper.Black hole may have swallowed neutron star, astronomers believeHuge neutron star sent blasts of material at EarthNasa detects ‘unusual’ infrared light from mysterious neutron star“Neutron stars have this tipping point where their interior densities get so extreme that the force of gravity overwhelms even the ability of neutrons to resist further collapse.\u0026nbsp“Each ‘most massive’ neutron star we find brings us closer to identifying that tipping point and helping us to understand the physics of matter at these mind boggling densities.”Pulsars spin with such speed and regularity that astronomers can use them to study the nature of space-time, the mass of stellar objects and our understanding of general relativity.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.Projections for the film’s opening weekend sat at the $5m-$8m (£4.5m-£6.4m), which it failed to meet.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The day before, in a video message also posted\u0026nbspon Twitter he said:\u0026nbspIt\u0027s up to you! The (Likud) lead is very small.His chief rival Benny Gantz, the country’s former army chief, meanwhile spoke to boisterous crowds in Kfar Ahmin, in the centre of the country after announcing he would make two former generals in his Blue and White party minister of defence and minister of education.The last polls published by Israeli TV channel 11 and 12 show Mr Netanyahu neck and neck with chief rival Gantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats. They also predict neither Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing block nor Gantz’s centre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to win the overall 61 seat majority needed to form a ruling government, prompting fears of a third election.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Government has to push for change, otherwise it will only be a matter of time until someone  dies.”New statistics published by NHS Digital have shown a dramatic increase in the number of young children admitted to hospital with anaphylactic shock - a reaction so severe it can be fatal.A worrying  children aged  and under were treated for anaphylaxis from  to , compared to  from  to  - a rise of over a third.Clare, , who lives in Canterbury, Kent, with husband Stewart, , a tennis coach, and her two remaining daughters Charlotte, , and April, one, knew Sadie had issues from when she was a baby.Her reactions were severe, with her lips quickly swellingshe came into contact with milk, but it took six months of doctors trips before they got help.Eventually tests showed she was allergic to dairy and nuts.There are no official Government guidelines on allergy testing, and Clare calls care haphazard - Sadie was in and out of hospital for the first four years of her le as she kept having reactions.Eventually her family paid for private tests, with Clare claiming kids with allergies should be checked regularly as things change so quickly with them.“I cant tell you what kind of stress we suffered,” Clare says.“I battled severe anxiety for the first four years of Sadies le. Its so scary, you get conflicting information, I didnt know what was safe.But things didnt get easier.“The first time she had an anaphylactic shock she was five, Clare recalls. “We put that down to a contaminated spoon in an ice cream parlour.“The second time it happened shed accidentally eaten a brioche bun and had a delayed anaphylactic shock two hours later.“She had another one after a plain burger. There was no dairy listed in the ingredients but she reacted.“Still there was no follow up appointment.It was at a family picnic in Whistable, Kent, in August , that Sadie suffered a fatal anaphylactic reaction after eating a ham sandwich - even though Clare had checked the packaging to be sure she could have it.Although the family gave her medication and quickly got her to a nearby medical centre, Sadie was unresponsive.She went into cardiac arrest, and nothing could be done to save her.Lynne Regent, chief executive of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity said modern diets could be to blame.One child in  now has a serious nut allergy which means every school across Britain is affected, she says.Allergies can be hereditary.If there is asthma in the family, sometimes you get children developing food allergies but it also happens in families where there is no history of anything.Our eating habits have changed exponentially over the past few years. We all eat more processed food and there is less cooking from scratch. We eat dferent sorts of food from all over the world.We dont know why this might cause allergies but its a change in behaviour that might explain why allergies are increasing. Its something we need to research.A Swedish study of over one million children found that babies born via Caesarean section are five times more likely to develop food allergies in later le.Presumably this is due to the dferent bacteria a child is first exposed to, Dr Brough says. Whether they go through the birth canal or not and the impact this has on their gut bacteria.Babies fed formula milk are also more likely to suffer skin allergies such as eczema and dermatitis, though evidence is thin on the ground.It is probably the lack of breastfeeding rather than formula that is the issue, Dr Brough explains.There is only one proper study due to ethical issues but children in the control group with low breastfeeding rates had double the risk of eczema up until one year of age.Many parents say their childs allergies appear to have been present from birth.One of those is Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, whose daughter Natasha died aged  after eating a Pret a Manger baguette containing sesame seeds on a BA flight to France.Natasha was severely allergic to sesame seeds but they weren’t listed in the ingredients.Tanya , from Fulham, South London, struggled to access the right support in Natasha’s younger years.“I gave Natasha a tiny bit of banana when she was six months old and she had an anaphylactic reaction,” Tanya recalls.“I became terried about what might cause a reaction. I went to my GP and asked about allergies and I asked whether Natasha should have a test, but he said No, its really rare, nothing to worry about.“He told me to wean her on to a dairy milk formula. I did, and she had a full anaphylactic reaction. Her lips and face swelled, she was struggling to breathe. Still, we were offered no tests.”Until Natasha was two, she survived on chicken and vegetable soup made at home by her mum as the family tried to avoid potential allergens. She was also diagnosed with asthma.“Aged two and a half, she grabbed a bread stick with sesame seeds on it and she reacted, Tanya explains. It was then she was finally given a blood test.“Sometimes just walking into a coffee shop would make her react, we put it down to milk proteins in the airthey were making frothy coffee.Tanya believes the rate of allergies has increased so fast that professionals are struggling to cope.We are facing a time bomb when it comes to allergies – and it’s going to explode, she says.After Natasha’s death in , her parents set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, a charity which aims to raise awareness of allergies as well as pushing for change.Their biggest success is with Natasha’s Law, legislation which will force businesses to list the full ingredients on prepackaged foods from the summer of .Mum Emma Amoscato has two children - James, six, and Amalia, three - with allergies and hopes the law will make things easier for her.“A lot of places now will have a disclaimer and say they cant guarantee any of their food is free from anything,” explains Emma, , a writer from Bedfordshire.“At the moment, restaurants only have to list the top  allergens and both of mine have quite rare allergies.Swollen lips and or eyes, itchy skin or a rash like hives, wheezing and finding it hard to breathe or speak, feeling faint, dizzy or confused, vomiting or having diarrhoea are just some of the symptoms of severe allergy and need immediate action.This is by no means a full list of symptoms, so always speak to your doctor about what you should watch out for.Sometimes there are other factors that on the day can increase the severity of your reaction. These are called co-factors and these can include exercise, feeling unwell with a viral illness, alcohol and tablets, such as some painkillers.For some people with allergies, more serious reactions such as anaphylaxis may only occurthey have eaten a specic food, or taken the medication to which they are allergic, then they exercise.People with asthma and allergies are known to be more at risk of severe reactions than those without.Just like Sadie’s family, Emma struggled to get testing for James. He was a grizzly baby and by the time he was  weeks old he had severe eczema.His reactions grew steadily stronger and around his first birthday he was referred to a specialist and diagnosed with allergies to milk, garlic, egg, sesame, some nuts and sumac.He was admitted to hospital with anaphylaxis after taking a sip from another child’s milk cup while on holiday. Dad Carl, , had to inject him with adrenaline.“After that it kicked in for us how serious it was,” Emma says. “We kept asking ourselves what wed doit happened again, wondering what would happenwe werent with him.“We read news stories about children like ours who have died, it’s a huge worry every day of our lives.People say its because we are too clean but my children have had allergies since birth. That doesnt explain what has happened to them - we need answers.Sadie’s parents Clare and Stewart believe the UK has a lot more work to do when it comes to providing care and awareness for allergy sufferers.“No one  should have to die for things to improve,” says Clare.“Sadies little sister is also battling allergies. I live every day terried that I will have to say goodbye to another little girl.I cant do that - something must be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have Farage’s no-deal Brexiteers pulling one way.And those who want no Brexit at all pulling in the other direction.Neither are true democrats, because during the referendum the Leave camp promised to get a good deal from the EU, while Remain politicians said that they’d respect the result.And while those isive groups may shout the loudest, neither represent the majority of the British public who just want politicians to get on with it and work together to deliver a sensible Brexit.That’s why we’ve this week formed our cross-party MPs For A Deal group, to remind the public that there is still a majority of politicians who would prefer a deal-based Brexit to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or an undemocratic no Brexit at all.Founding members include Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and Labour’s Caroline Flint.We all come from very dferent political backgrounds, and even on Brexit we’ve had our dferences. Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final.

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They dont like HIV being compared to obesity or smoking. Yes it is unfortunate and treatable but so is obesity and smoking. #GarethThomas.One Twitter user replied: “I’d love to knowyou know the circumstances under which Gareth actually contracted HIV  Was it a choice  Like putting food and fags in your mouth are “I highly f***ing doubt it.”Another added: “Its a disease you can get even while taking all precautions. Obesity and smoking are ppl failing to control themselves, over and over again. Hardly the same you moron.”Responding to outraged Twitter users, he added: My last comment on Gareth Thomas. I dont give a damn what he does in his private le thats his business.I do however think we should treat HIV the same way we treat smoking, obesity and drinking. It is a public health issue. We need to help but also educate.Brookstein, who also blasted real camp guys in his rant, was slammed for his uneducated and shocking interpretation of the virus.Since , anyone with HIV on effective treatment has the same le expectancy as anyone of their age in the general population, and cannot pass the virus on.Twitter user John Walsh slammed Brooksteins ignorance, writing: Proving yourself to be extremely homophobic... that is a weekend on Twitter that will severely impact your future career!Another Twitter user added: Such an uneducated reaction to @gareththomas being brave and telling the world something which is really a very private matter to him.

It’s sick and I’ve been through hell,” Gareth, , told the Sunday Mirror.“I was being blackmailed and in my mind I thought you only get blackmailed for something really bad, which compounded the feeling of shame.“When someone  knows a secret as big as that they can determine your happiness or sadness every morning and use it as a weapon against you and your family.”He and his husband of four years Stephen, , have won the support of Prince Harry, who praised him on Twitter.The Duke of Sussex wrote: “Gareth, you are an absolute legend! In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV.We should all be appalled by the way you were forced to speak your truth, it is yours and yours alone to share on your terms and I and millions stand with you.”Matthew Hodson, executive director of NAM, a British HIV Aids information charity, said declaring an HIV status remained a dficult decision for many.It can often be met with hostility and fear and this can, in extreme circumstances, result in violence, Hodson said.According to UNAIDS, almost  million people globally are living with HIV Aids.

It came as leader Jo Swinson was branded a hypocrite after a video emerged of her speaking in  calling for an In Out referendum on Britains EU membership.Mr Lamb also slammed the Lib Dems’ refusal to compromise over Brexit and said the party held some of the responsibility for “opening the door to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson to prosper.”Lib Dem peer Paul Scriven joined the growing internal backlash against the partys new policy, tweeting: “I agree totally with Norman Lamb that our new policy on Article  is wrong and we are boarding on becoming extreme on Brexit.We will not help to bring the Country togetherwe unilaterally act in this way. And former Lib Dem MP Andrew George said the policy risks alienating our Leave voting supporters.He warned: I fear adopting an implausible Revoke A policy will prove counterproductive. Alienate Brexit extremists not those who were misled by them.It comes after new Lib Dem MP Sam Gyimah broke ranks with his new party over the policy just hours after joining.He said an election “muddies Brexit with lots of other domestic issues,” adding: “If you want to resolve Brexit the best way to do is to have a People’s Vote now that we all know what is negotiable.”Yesterday leader Jo Swinson was forced to deny she was “an iteration of Nigel Farage” at the other end of the Brexit spectrum after the party officially adopted the new policy to reverse Brexit.She told Sky News: “I fundamentally disagree. We are clear on our position on EU membership, but I respect the views of people who take a dferent view.”But today she will risk further controversy as she uses her keynote speech to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth to compare No Deal preparations to “planning to burn your house down”.She will add: “You might have insurance, but you’re still going to lose all your stuff.”Meanwhile Ms Swinson ruled out working with either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn in the event of a hung Parliament after the next election.She told Sky News: “Neither of those men are fit to be prime minister. I will not vote to make either of those men prime minister.” Instead she insisted she was standing as a candidate for Prime Minister.Yesterday new Lib Dem Chuka Umunna said as many as  seats were in the partys reach.Setting the bar very high the ex-Labour MP said: I would hope that we get more than  seats at a general election but we know from the internal polling thatwe move from the position that were in and say there is a . per cent to  per cent swing we can get up to  seats andtheres a  per cent swing towards the Liberal Democrats through the course of the campaign  seats are in contention - but who knows what will happen We are not complacent, we are not drunk on our success, we want to continue to expand the bandwidth, draw people into the party.Leader Jo Swinson campaigned for a referendum. Now, having lost, she would simply annul it. That is not a credible position for a serious politician.The Libs blundered in electing her. So did ex-Tory and Labour MPs joining her.The party’s positions are incoherent. Treasury spokesman Ed Davey says Leave voters would “have a central place in a Lib Dem economy” — but only after Swinson has stripped them of their democratic rights.The big eco announcement, a deterrent tax on flights, would exempt people flying “for family and things”. That’s not a considered policy. That’s wibble.What a choice Swinson has given Remainers who aim to vote on Brexit lines: Corbyn’s anti-Semitic Marxists reducing our economy to rubble . . .Or her own reckless extremism setting fire to our democracy. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Such proposals have not yet been made.“The Commission will remain available to work  .“The October European Council will be an important milestone in the process.Before the summit Boris said he felt passionately that we will get a Brexit deal by October  - despite the efforts of Remainer MPs to “crush” Britain’s hopes.He wrote in the : If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit on October  and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the Channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland.I believe passionately that we can do it, and I believe that such an agreement is in the interests not just of the UK but also of our European friends.Boris wanded a boost today after the DUP showed signs they were softening on the idea of an “all-Ireland” farming market after our orce from the bloc.Jeffrey Donaldson, the party’s chief whip, said the idea of an agri-food sector to avoid a hard border was being considered.He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland said: “Where there is political will, there is certainly a way.

Edie Radbourne was so tiny when she was born three months early that her parents could see through her skin. She weighed less than a bag of sugar when she came into the world at Royal Derby Hospital on April ,  - months before her due date of July . Now her father, Ben Radbourne, who is head of Brackensdale Primary school in Mackworth, Derby, has opened up about how hard it was as surgeons in Sheffield fought to save his daughter. Birth complications forced the miracle tot to have four brain surgeries, one heart surgery and even have part of her stomach removed.    Mr Radbourne, , said: You donapost realise until you have had a premature baby how dficult it is. She came into the world at  weeks and now she has a chance to have a full le. She came home in October for two weeks and she was on  [types of] medication a day. The surgeons were scared she was not going to survive. For the first month or so there were concerns she might not make it. And then each surgery has been a time when we have been made aware things could go wrong but thankfully havenapost. When Edie was born, she was so premature that Royal Derby didnapost have the facilities to look after her so she was taken to Sheffield Teaching Hospital. Edie, now aged one, was only two days old when specialist doctors there discovered a bleed on her brain and put her on oxygen. That led to her contracting chronic lung disease - something that regularly happens in situations like this.    A few days later she had an heart operation to help her pump blood to the rest of the body. Then her stomach ruptured, turned black, and an emergency operation had to take place to have part of it removed. Doctors said the increased pressure on her brain could lead to permanent damage so she had a needle put in her brain to remove liquids. She now lives with a shunt which she will need to have for the rest of her le to allow fluid to move from her brain to the rest of her body. The youngster was cared for at the hospital for the first few months of her le while her parents travelled to and from Sheffield to be by her side. She was finally able to go home in November  and continues to get stronger every day, her family say. Father-of-four Mr Radbourne thanked the staff at Sheffield Teaching Hospital for their amazing work. He said: When she was born, we werenapost allowed to hold her for a few days. Her skin was see through. I think she will always be tiny. I would travel to Sheffield and back twice a day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A disabled man who weights almost st has blasted his housing association after it refused to make his back door big enough so he could get out.Darren Burns, who is in a wheelchair, is too big to get through the standard size door to his garden and fears he could become trappedthere is a fire.The -year-old is obese due to a le-long hip disorder that affects mobility and has suffered from arthritis since the age of , Grimsby Live reports.His condition worsened when he was involved in a car crash two-and-a-half years ago, leaving him wheelchair-bound and his weight gain subsequently snowballed to over st. He ed to Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, after being made homeless and moved into his current property in March last year.    Lincolnshire Housing Partnership , which owns the property, widened the front and interior doors to help make the house more accessible, as well as making other adjustments to bring the bungalow up-to-date. The back door, however, remains inaccessible because it hasn’t been adjusted with the result that Darren cant get out to sit in his garden. It has sent him into a deep state of anxiety and depression and he is worried that,there’s a fire, he’ll be trapped inside his own home. But LHP say they carried out their own formal independent investigation and came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to make adjustments to the rear of the property. It turns out that the authority says they’re only responsible to provide one exit. However, some people get two. It’s like a lottery, he said. If there’s a fire at the front of the house and that is blocked, the fire service said they’d have dficulty getting me out because I’m a big guy. “All I wanted was to get settled and sorted out. “They made the house  per cent perfect but what they didn’t do was a door entry system and I’m doubly incontinent soI need to let someone in of a night I might not be in the best state.  “I don’t want everyone having keys and having a key box frightens the le out of me because they’re not impenetrable. I have anxiety so I would never sleep again. Darren is trying to desperately lose weight and says he’s lost  pounds since taking medication to treat his diabetes after he was diagnosed last year. He says all he wants to do is to be able to enjoy his own back garden and not be a prisoner in his own home as he tries to get his social le back on track. “I’ve been anxious about this on top of my usual anxiety and depression,” he said. “Anywhere I’ve ever lived I’ve been able to get out into the yard and when you’re not very able it’s nice to get outside. I could even put a coat on in winter and go outside and sit with a cup of coffee while watching the birdsI wanted to. “I’ve been denied that privilege,you want to call it that, for the last two years. “As a disabled person I’ve lived for two years with this level of distress in this property and I wouldn’t have taken it had I known that this was the case.” He feels he’s being discriminated because of his weight and admits that,he had another disability, he may be given a higher priority.  His anxiety makes it dficult to leave the house but Darren, who is unemployed, says his depression isn’t being helped by not being able to get fresh air. “Too many organisations want to fat shame me when it’s not my disability,” he said. “It’s a causal effect, not a primary. “There’s no doubt that losing weight will help me be healthier and it impacts every facet of my le. “You can’t click your fingers and say ‘I’m thin’ because it takes a lot of time to get overweight so you’re not going to get thin overnight. “With depression it’s a very circular issue. A lot of people run to the drug dealer for their fix but I roll on to the refrigerator. I’m trying to do something about that.” A spokesperson from LHP said: Since being made aware of the customer’s concerns, the Lincolnshire Housing Partnershipteam, which was Shoreline Housing Partnership initially, has worked extensively to meet their needs, something that we would do for any inidual with specic housing requirements. Once a suitable property was identied, a process was followed to ensure the necessary work was identied and carried out – this involves recommendations from an Occupational Therapist, who is not employed by LHP, and the awarding of a North East Lincolnshire Disabilities Facilities Grant, .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe nation looked on in horror as Manchester Dogs’ Home burnt to the ground five years ago, claiming the lives of  of its canine inhabitants. Staff and residents risked their lives as they desperately tried to free dogs trapped in the inferno, but they were unable to save them all. Grief-stricken dog lovers dug deep and donated more than £million – including a £, donation from X-Factor boss Simon Cowell, pictured inset – to help rebuild the kennels which rescue and re-home hundreds of stray and abandoned dogs each year. It has been a long and slow process, but – thanks to the generosity of the public – the home now boasts five state-of-the-art kennel blocks, and a newly-built adoption centre where families can come and meet the dogs.    And the icing on the cake will be a memorial garden on the site of the fire-ravaged kennel block paying tribute to the dogs who tragically lost their lives. Dogs’ home manager Steve Mapley says: “The words thank you just aren’t enough. In the days after the fire we were just totally overwhelmed by the generosity of the public who gave their hard-earned cash so we would have the funds to re-build and continue to help. “The first couple of weeks after the fire were just like being in a bubble. We were concentrating on the dogs and the staff and trying to make sure we were operating the best we could. Now to have come out of the other side of it we realise the support was amazing.    “It is funny how over time, both myself and Colin who was the first responder on the night, choke up more about it now than we did then. Now we have had time to sit back and think about it, it gets you a bit more the emotion of it.” As he proudly shows us around the newly-rebuilt kennels, it is no wonder Steve and his staff feel indebted to the people who gave so generously. Gone are the burnt-out shells of the old Victorian-style kennels, and in their place are modern new kennel blocks which can house more than  stray or abandoned dogs.    Each dog has its own kennel with a dedicated sleeping area and play area – complete with under-floor heating to keep the pooches cosy and warm. The kennels now have their own in-house kitchen so staff can prepare and make food on-site, along with a dedicated grooming area to keep the dogs looking their best for visitors. The donations have also helped staff beef up security on the site in a bid to ensure there isn’t a repeat of the blaze with CCTV cameras, improved fencing and a night-time security guard on duty. But the centrepiece of the complex is the brand new purpose-built doggy adoption centre, where the dogs who are ready for re-homing are kept ready to meet their new families. Each dog has its own glass-fronted kennel so they can show off their best tricks to visitors, and in the middle of the building is a play area where prospective owners can meet their new friend.    Steve says: “None of this would have been possible without the donations from the public. “The renovations have cost upwards of the £million that was raised, and while what we have done is amazing, we have still got more work to do.” And this means despite the flood of donations that came in after the fire, the centre still needs help, not only to complete the rebuild but also to fund the day-to-day running costs. Steve explains: “It costs between £.million to £million a year to keep the centre running – our vet bills alone are astronomical. Our drug bill is at least £, per month, andwe have dogs here with complex medical issues like cancer or broken limbs that can be much higher.” Fortunately the number of stray dogs the charity encounters is less than it was a few years ago, partly due to the success of microchipping laws and neutering programmes. Several charities in the Manchester area are also working with stray and abandoned dogs.    Changes in housing in the area means that more people live in flats or apartments where they can’t keep dogs, meaning that fewer dogs are roaming the streets. But sadly the home is seeing an increase in the numbers of stray dogs with serious health conditions, which Steve suspects may be down to the fact that owners can no longer afford pet insurance or expensive vet bills. “Dogs with health problems is always a big issue,” says Steve. “We never know what is going to come through the door. Recently we have seen several dogs with cases of mange, with broken bones. “We see a lot of stray dogs that have long-term medical problems that we wouldn’t have seen five years ago, and this is probably because people can’t afford medical insurance or vet care any more. Usually the dogs come in as strays, we get people bringing dogs in that they say they have found as strays, but we can tell by the way the dog interacts with them that it is theirs.”  But no problem is too big for Steve and his staff at the dogs’ home, and they can spend weeks and months nurturing dogs back to health and giving the care and training they need to find their perfect forever home. “There is no time limit for the dogs here -they have health problems we will work with them to get them healthy and regain trust,” he says. “It ies from dog to dog on how long it takes for them to be re-homed – some can be here for three years.” Breeds like pugs, French bulldogs or Jack Russells are really popular for re-homing, whereas dogs like Staffordshire bull terriers can take longer. Recently the home has seen an increase in husky-type dogs coming through the door – which Steve believes is down to Game of Thrones. Dogs like Timber who has been waiting for a new home for six months.  Kennel hand Maria Brookes explains: “He is a Siberian husky and they need a lot of exercise and an awful lot of grooming – people don’t realise how much care they need.” Also waiting for a new home is two-year-old Lurcher-cross Conker. She came into the home as a stray seven months ago and sadly two attempts at re-homing her have failed. Maria says: “Conker is quite nervous. She would be fine with her immediate family but wouldn’t like lots of visitors. When she knows you well enough she will love you.” Patterdale terrier-cross Reggie is  months old and currently undergoing a training programme at the home to prepare him for adoption.

The most common glaucomastarts slowly, and to begin with there are no symptoms so some don’t realise they have the condition until it is fairly advanced. Karen Osborn, chief executive of the International Glaucoma ­Association, says: “We regularly hear from people who have permanently lost sight to glaucoma because of late diagnosis. People are often angry and upset when they learn that simple regular visits to an ­optometrist could have detected the condition. The earlier treatment starts, the more likely that someone will retain useful sight for le.” Dr Nigel Best, Specsavers clinical spokesman, adds: “There are several factors which can increase your risk of developing glaucoma. As in Sophie’s case, a family history of the disease increases the chances, but other risk factors include those who have black-African or Asian heritage, as well as those who have higher levels of short sightedness. “Of course, age also needs to be considered, as two in  people over the age of  are affected with the condition.” Due to the genetic link, Sophie’s motherwas advised to have her own eyes checked after Megsie’s diagnosis. She was told her eye ­pressure was at the upper limits of normal and prescribed drops to keep it down.    “I’m so happy that Ma got in there early and has these amazing eye drops three times a day, which have stood her in really good stead and stopped the problem getting worse for almost  years now,” says Sophie. The treatment includes two sets of drops, a beta-blocker which suppresses production of aqueous humourand latanoprost, which helps keep drainage channels clear. Sophie and her family are now all vigilant about monitoring their own sight. “Had Ma’s glaucoma not been caught when it was, it could have been a very dferent story,” says Sophie.  “That’s why my sister Emma and I made sure we have had our eyes checked regularly throughout our lives, even though I didn’t even need glasses until eight years ago when I became long sighted. “If you haven’t got any symptoms we just naturally assume we are fine but getting your eyes tested is such an easy thing to get done and just one of those things people should do every couple of years to keep the show on the road.

The Met Office predicts that temperatures will rise to C in London on Saturday afternoon, making it as hot as Barcelona. The mercury will gradually creep up over the next few days, from C today, to C tomorrow and C on Thursday and Friday, according to Weather Online. The majority of the country will enjoy unseasonably sunny weather, although there could still be flooding in some areas as well as mist and fog.    The warm weather is a welcome relief from last nightaposs rather chilly conditions, with temperatures dropping to -.C in Hexham, Northumberland, yesterday . However, the weather will not be perfect for the whole country today, as the Environment Agency has warned of possible flooding along East Yorkshireaposs North Sea coast and the Humber estuary. Fog and mist is also expected on Friday morning in Northern Ireland, west Scotland, north Wales and north-east, north-west, central and East England.  A spokesman for netweather.tv said: By Thursday, instead of the high teens being the max, some parts at least will head up into the low-twenties. Not too bad for the second half of September. One thing weaposll have to watch out for all week, and particularly from Wednesday night onwards is the threat of some mist and fog patches developing. A few of these may be slow to clear into the mornings too. One exception to the fine, dry rule will be the far north and north-west of Scotland, as fronts just brush in at times bringing some extra cloud and mostly patchy rain. Even here the picture should improve after midweek though.  A Met Office spokesman said: High pressure will dominate this week bringing warm days but chilly nights. Through midweek some rain will affect Scotland but later in the week the high drts eastwards dragging in warmer air in time for the weekend. Temperatures peaked at .C in Cambridge last September, according to the Met Office. Met Office five-day weather forecast  Today: After a chilly start, most of the UK will have a dry day with light winds and a lot of sunny spells. The only showers will be in the Northern Isles, though even here the overnight wind will die down. Tonight: Much of the country will have another dry and clear night though low temperatures will cause a few mist patches to form. Cloud and rain will move into northern Scotland.

Catherine Hellyer, , never thought twice about her daily order of a sausage roll, a multi-pack of brownie bites and a milky coffee laden with sugar. She ate the same lunchtime order every weekday for almost two years. Catherine, from Nottingham, said: The only time it really ied wasI added a chicken tikka baguette on top. “Honestly, my diet was so bad it was ridiculous, I must have been eating a week’s worth of calories in a couple of days. I even used to go to Greggs to get a pain au chocolat for breakfast most mornings because it was on my walk in to work. “I reckonGreggs had a points system I could have bought my own house with what I must have spent in there!.    As the pastries piled up, the weight piled on and by Christmas  Catherine tipped the scales at almost  stone. It was then, after a miserable shopping trip to find an outfit for a Christmas party, that she decided she had to do something. Catherine added: “I just wanted something cheap and cheerful to wear, but I’d gone up to a size   and I couldn’t find anything to fit in the high street shops. “I thought at least I could get something in Primark but even there, trying on tops I thought would be fine, I was struggling to squeeze into a size . “I thought, how has this happened  I’d gone from being someone who was always the big jolly curvy girl, really full of confidence, to feeling so unhappy in myself. “After that Christmas, I had a week’s holiday. It’d be a really busy, tough time, my first Christmas as a store manager, and the first three days of my leave I don’t think I even got dressed.    I didn’t leave the house, I just lay on the sofa watching telly and binge eating to fill some kind of void which only made me feel worse. “And then all the photos from the Christmas parties started to appear. I’d done my make-up and my hair really nice and then I saw the photos and all I could think was, woah, that doesn’t even look like me.” Noticing how unhappy she was, Catherine’s partner Joe suggested she join her local Slimming World group. “He was worried about me because something in me had just given up and he knew my best friend Belle was going to a group near her and loved it,” she says. Catherine joined Slimming World in January , weighing  stones lb, and by Christmas  she’d lost more than six stones and managed to overhaul the eating habits which she admits had spiralled out of control. She added: I’ve always been bigger but that was part of my personality and it never bothered me.  “As a teenager I was very bubbly and outgoing, I had no problems making friends and I’d always be the first to put my hand up and volunteer for anything. “I met my boyfriend at university and we stayed in Nottingham after graduation, but a lot of my friends left so suddenly I wasn’t in a group anymore and that’s when my eating started going downhill. “I became a bit of a secret eater, hiding what I was doing from my other half and lying about the food I’d eaten. If I’d eaten a whole family bar of chocolate I’d pretend I’d put half away for later,I ate chocolate in the car I’d hide the wrappers behind the seat andI had a whole packet of biscuits I’d say I’d taken them into work. It was bizarre because I had no reason to lie but I think I was lying to myself as much as him.” Even when she moved to a new job, her diet still didn’t improve and Catherine would go to the Pound Shop and buy a three-pack of Kinder Buenos. But Catherine says from her first Slimming World meeting she’s never looked back, adding: I cried when I got weighed, it was such a shock, and I was really close to tears the whole time, but it was honestly the best evening ever. It was a proper move forward moment for me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ww2 hero 96 marries man","story":"NewsWW hero, , marries man, , after hiding true sexuality for his entire leGeorge Montague, , who lives in Brighton, aims to be the \"oldest gay man\" in the UK after being married to a woman for more than  years and having three kidsShareCommentsByDan ColesWilliam Lailey:,  SEP NewsHe considers himself the oldest gay man of the village \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Keeper Hamilton, though, made a top save ing to his left to deny Trouten from the spot.MacDonald denied McDaid on  minutes as he pushed the winger#s header out before Cammy Kerr was denied what looked an obvious penalty by referee Alan Newlands with  minutes to go.Robert Thomson then had the chance to grab a point for Alloa late on but fluffed his lines.Dundee: Hamilton, Kerr, McGhee, Forster, Marshall, Byrne, Robertson, McGowan , McDaid, McPake , Johnson .Subs not used: Sharp, Mackie, Moore, Anderson.Alloa: MacDonald, Taggart, Graham, Deas, Dick, Cawley , Flannigan, Hetherington, O#Hara, Trouten, Thomson.Subs not used: Henry, Robertson, Brown, Gilhooley, O#Donnell, Gillespie.Attendance: ,"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d382714055389.83294295-e1564477706176.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake to shake things up for alloa clash following recent losses","story":"Dundee boss James McPake will ring the changes for tomorrow’s Championship clash with Alloa Athletic.On the back of a disastrous derby display in their - defeat at Tannadice, the Dark Blues were dumped out of the Challenge Cup by League Two Elgin.Manager James McPake will certainly make one change but is likely to make more after two disappointing results.Goalkeeper Calum Ferrie was sent off last Sunday and will serve a suspension this weekend.

He came in for pre-season looking sharp and really fit and he’s carried that right through into the league campaign,” said McMullan.“He’s been really good but that’s probably gone under the radar a wee bit with Shanks scoring however many goals he has, but Louis has been great.“I’m sure Shanks will say the same thing because Louis has been really good for him and they seem to work together very well.“It’s made things a bit more dficult for defences because there is two of them up there to worry about and that’s good for us.“The two of them complement each other very well and that’s what you want from your strikers. It’s good for the team.”As they look to continue what’s been a perfect start in the Championship with, four wins from four outings so far, tomorrow sees United head for Ayr United and potentially one of their toughest tests to date.McMullan is well aware last season Somerset Park was not a happy hunting ground.It saw United suffer two defeats that were signicant blows to their automatic promotion challenge.While he is determined to take three points this time, he expects to have to work hard for them.“They were dficult to play against last year and it will be the same again,” McMullan added.“They are direct and make the game really physical. You don’t really get a minute on the ball.“So you have to be ready to go against them andyou are not at it % then you will get beat.”Of course, one big plus this time round is that man Shankland being in tangerine instead of black and white.McMullan’s viewing that as a double bonus.“I think he scored six goals against us so it will be great that he is not up against us this time.“Having him in your team is brilliant. You just need to get it into the vicinity of the -yard box and the ball usually hits him and then goes in!”For the Terrors, the main priority is another win to keep the early season momentum going.While he admits his preference would have been for the league games to be coming thick and fast right now, he’s not too concerned about last week’s break for the Challenge Cup possibly interrupting the team’s flow.“The cup has kind of broken it up a bit for us. It was a bit inconvenient, to be honest, and it’s not the greatest cup as it is.“It kind of broke up our momentum but we are determined to pick up where we left off after the derby against Dundee.”“The positive side of the couple of breaks we’ve had since the league started is that they can give time for boys who’ve picked up knocks to recover properly and we’ll all be feeling fresh for this game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite. I was drinking to knock myself out.”Ian, , of Earn Crescent, said his le was so low he had suicidal thoughts of slitting his wrists and jumping off the Tay Road Bridge.He said: “I kept a diary. I wrote in it every day the amount of times I was sick, bleeding, diarrhoea, then wrote that I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up.”Ian desperately wanted out of the le of alcoholism but he did not know how he could escape it without dying.He said: “I was hospitalised dozens of times.“I wasn’t the master of my le anymore, alcohol was the master of me, everything I did revolved around it.“I lived in a slum.“There was blood everywhere, spewing everywhere, mouldy drink cans, pee all over the place – I knew it was a slum but I didn’t care.”It got so bad that Ian could not walk or talk and was checked into former psychiatric hospital Sunnyside in Montrose three times for detoxication by his family.But it was only following the third time Ian made the conscious decision to stay sober – a feat he’s managed for  years now.He said: “I’m not proud of myself.“I don’t look at the past, I just take each day at a time.“I tell myself I’m sober today and the rest slowly takes care of itself.”Ian now keeps himself busy with activities such as drawing and creative projects at Just Bee Productions.The community group offers people a safe space to be creative and connect with others at vulnerable times in their lives.Ian said: “Getting involved with Just Bee is one of the best things that’s ever happened to me.“It keeps my mind busy and gives me something positive to focus on and it’s good to be around people again, instead of sitting in the house on my own all day with just my thoughts.”Ian and about  other participants in the group are gearing up to start working on a musical theatre show called This is a Mental Musical.Claire Bee, founder of Just Bee Productions, said: “The show is about mental health and everything that goes along with that.“It’s also about giving people a  to have a voice to say what they want to say.”The show will be performed in Dundee and the group hopes to take it to Edinburgh Fringe Festival next year.Former plays performed by Just Bee include Drink, The Musical which toured community venues in Dundee, including nearby prisons, and another musical called Next Stop Please.Former heroin addict Cheryl Ferguson, , said: “Doing the musicals has helped to build up my confidence, self worth and a feeling that I belong.“It’s opened up opportunities which I wouldn’t have thought were possible and I’ve met loads of brilliant people who are like family now.“I love it.

defeat of Ross County.Instead they delivered the blunt lack of creativity that had resulted in shooting blanks in four of five games before beating County.Striker Stevie May, at £, the most expensive signing during McInnes’ six years at the club, made a quickto Pittodrie.May had the final two years of his Pittodrie contract cancelled three weeks ago to pave the way for a move to St Johnston having netted just eight times in  games for the Dons.May had not scored this year with his last goal coming in Aberdeen’s - loss to Celtic on Boxing Day – and that was a penalty.As was the case in his time at Pittodrie there was plenty of effort and desire from May but at no point did he threaten to end that long scoring drought.The woodwork denied Aberdeen in the th minute when Sam Cosgrove met a cross from Greg Leigh but his header hit the base of the far post.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when Leigh burst forward at pace. He was tackled with the ball cannoning off Lewis Ferguson into the path of Ryan HEDGES who clinically fired a left-foot drive beyond keeper Zander Clark from  yards.Aberdeen hit the self-destruct button in the rd minute through a combination of poor defending and a rare slip-up from keeper Joe Lewis.From the left Tanser found Michael O#Halloran unmarked outside the box and he was given too much time to strike a low shot which squirmed between the ing Lewis’ hands.Early after the break Saints’ Davidson twice threatened when heading wide and then having a vicious -yard drive well saved by Lewis at the near post.Saints were enraged in the th minute when they were given a penalty – then had the spot-kick rightly taken away from them.Referee McLean pointed to the spot after Kennedy went down when running across Andy Considine. If there was any contact it was minimal and it was Kennedy who clipped Considine.So rare in Scottish football, the referee was open to the notion that he could be wrong and used common sense. There were no flying pigs among the seagulls swooping over Pittodrie.Following consultation with assistant Graeme Stewart on the touchline, McLean overruled his initial decision.Aberdeen were denied by a superb save from Clark in injury time when Ferguson’s powerful -yard free kick took a defection off the defensive wall but the keeper adjusted."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d7a379f9a70a8.35215925-375x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet clive kenzie ava and lola all need a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home Handsome Clive is around four to five years old and is looking for a home with a secure garden so he can enjoy the sunshine.We sadly don’t have any history on Clive but we do know he needs a home with no cats as he will chase them!He would make an ideal companion for another dog or for someone on their own looking for a companion to get them out and about.Can you offer Clive his forever home  vw, px\"  This cheeky girl is full of fun and has lots of energy to keep you on your toes.She needs a home where she is the only pet – she isn’t good with other dogs and is not used to cats.Kenzie, who is around two years of age, is a playful girl and loves to play with her toys and romp around in the garden.Can you offer Kenzie her forever home  vw, px\"  This adorable pair are looking for a home together.They can be a little shy to begin with but curiosity soon gets the better of them.Ava and Lola, who are three years old, would be suited to a quiet home where they can be pampered and enjoy the good le.They are Indoor cats and not used to getting out.Can you offer Ava and Lola the new home they need Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee oor wullie auction raises almost 240000 for charity and aberdeens auction is tonight","story":"There was bucketloads of fun as the auction of the Oor Wullie statues got off to a flying start.Sculptures from Tayside went under the hammer raising £, for charity last night at the Dundee Rep Theatre.The highest grossing statue was Full o’Beans, which was housed at Discovery Point over the summer.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

The roof over this extension will be a green roof.ldquoThe proposal seeks to restore this category A listed building, rehabilitating it as a contemporary three-bedroom dwelling.ldquoOverall, the proposed architectural moves retain the external appearance and the local identity of the buildings and their surroundings while reconstructing existing dilapidated outbuildings.ldquoThe alterations respect the character, materials and scale of the existing fabric and enable it to meet st century standards for contemporary family living by replacing all windows and doors and including new internal wall linings throughout the lodge and outbuildings where materials and internal finishes have been carefully considered and selected to enhance its historical features."},{"url":null,"title":"council-bit-environment","story":"BORDERS Council officials hope to join a new environment consultation.On September th, Scottish Government revealed it wants the public sector to spearhead efforts to combat carbon emissions in Scotland.We asked the Scottish Border Council what its plans for meeting government standards were and how they planned to go about achieving them.A spokesperson for the council told us: \"It is proposed that a first action for the Sustainable Development Group would be to review the recent decisions and actions of the UK and Scottish Governments and UK local authorities with a view to making recommendations as to how the council can play lsquoour partrsquo in tackling climate change.\"We will review the Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to achieve net-zero emissions of all greenhouse gases by  at the latest, consider how to respond to this objective, and, specically, any Scottish Borders targets and actions to which the Council should commit to.\"We have already carried out a number of positive projects including: installation of electric vehicle charge points and development of our electric vehicle fleet, delivering local home energy efficiency programmes supporting home insulation and launch of the Affordable Warmth and Energy Efficiency Strategy and local habitat enhancement projects.\"In  multiple city councils announced climate emergencies and were followed by UK governments soon after.Roseanna Cunningham, Climate Change Secretary for Scottish Government said: ldquoSeveral public bodies, including the City of Edinburgh Council, have already made firm commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

To date most of this work has focused on oceanic islands like Hawaii or the Canaries.However, oceanic islands are only present at the surface of the Earth for a few million years before they themselves subside and are subducted back into the mantle. So it can only provide a tiny snapshot of crustal recycling over the four billion years of Earth history.:Europes heatwave moves to Greenland, threatening ice sheetThe St Andrews team investigated a suite of alkaline magmas erupted in continental rts similar to the modern day East African rt.The Scottish scientists say that although these magmas have very unusual chemistries, they show many similarities with those oceanic lavas and, crucially, are found throughout Earthrsquos geological record.The team focused on an alkaline province in south-west Greenland using cutting-edge isotope techniques to chemically fingerprint ancient crustal material in the source of these magmas.Through a combination of remote field work - by boat and helicopter - and careful chemical analysis the team was able to show that these magmas were tapping into ancient crust subducted into the mantle  million years before the volcanoes started erupting.Once the team understood these processes in Greenland they compiled a global data on alkaline magma chemistry and were surprised to find that the vast majority contained a recycled crustal component in their magma source.Lead author Dr Will Hutchison, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University, said: ldquoOur key result is that the isotopes of alkaline magmas are highly iable and this suggests that their recycled crustal sources have changed through geological time.ldquoThe beauty of our global dataset is that it extends back over two billion years and so these unique alkaline rocks represent an extremely powerful record for understanding crustal recycling over Earth history.ldquoBy carefully bringing together the igneous and sedimentary isotope records, this might allow us to understand how changing crustal input is tied to volcanic output, and ultimately build a much better understanding of what happens to tectonic plates once they get transported into the deep Earth."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-ask-public-making-period-products-free","story":"Holyroodrsquos local government committee is seeking views on making the provision of period products a legal duty.The committee is currently considering a bill introduced by Labour MSP Monica Lennon aimed at ending ldquoperiod poverty by providing free sanitary products, a move which prompted Scottish government funding.After a rollout of a voluntary scheme in schools, colleges and universities last year, some railway stations, football stadiums and shopping centres have followed suit.If passed, the Bill would see schools and colleges across Scotland provide period products free of charge, and ministers empowered to place the same duty on other public bodies, compensating them for the costs.SNP committee convener James Dornan MSP said: ldquoNo one who needs period products should have to go without them because they canrsquot afford or access them.ldquoFree period products are supplied across schools, colleges and universities and under voluntary schemes by other public and community bodies.ldquoWe want to knowthis goes far enough and whether this should become a legal duty.

We are facing a food security crisis, exacerbated by uncertainty over the UKrsquos future trading position with the EU and the rest of the world.\"Ministers must now publish all the information they hold from Operation Yellowhammer on food security and likely costs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And she warned: ldquoMore people are living in cities at risk from over-heating and water shortages, theyrsquore breathing polluted air, eating more fast-food and getting less exercise.She called for ldquoa planetary health champion to put the agenda of peoplersquos and environmental health at the heart of government."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-scientists-discover-secrets-earths-crust","story":"The tectonic plates that make up the Earthrsquos crust are constantly jostling against each other, brushing past one another in some places, moving apart in other areas, and butting head-on in others.Now Scottish university scientists believe volcanoes on Greenland, believed to be some of the oldest on earth, could provide new insights into how and why this phenomenon happens.A study by scientists at the University of St Andrews, published today in Nature Communications, reveals the fate of the Earthrsquos ancient crust, the outer layer that is made up of dferent types of rock.And it tells of how that could help solve the mystery of how the Earthrsquos surface and mantle, which is below the crust, are connected.The Earthrsquos tectonic plates move around and collide at regions called subduction zones.Where head-on collisions occur, denser oceanic crust is shoved beneath lighter continental crust, causing it to melt in the ferocious temperatures and pressures of the Earthrsquos mantle.In areas of collision, crustal materials get transported into the deep mantle which, because of its high temperature and pressure, slowly flows and fuels the worldrsquos volcanoes.And one of the grand challenges in Earth Sciences is to understand what happens to this crust.At a few volcanoes on Earth geologists can find traces of these ancient crustal materials in the erupted lava. To date most of this work has focused on oceanic islands like Hawaii or the Canaries.However, oceanic islands are only present at the surface of the Earth for a few million years before they themselves subside and are subducted back into the mantle. So it can only provide a tiny snapshot of crustal recycling over the four billion years of Earth history.The St Andrews team investigated a suite of alkaline magmas erupted in continental rts similar to the modern day East African rt.The Scottish scientists say that although these magmas have very unusual chemistries, they show many similarities with those oceanic lavas and, crucially, are found throughout Earthrsquos geological record.The team focused on an alkaline province in south-west Greenland using cutting-edge isotope techniques to chemically fingerprint ancient crustal material in the source of these magmas.Through a combination of remote field work ndash by boat and helicopter ndash and careful chemical analysis the team was able to show that these magmas were tapping into ancient crust subducted into the mantle  million years before the volcanoes started erupting.Once the team understood these processes in Greenland they compiled a global data on alkaline magma chemistry and were surprised to find that the vast majority contained a recycled crustal component in their magma source.Lead author Dr Will Hutchison, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University, said: ldquoOur key result is that the isotopes of alkaline magmas are highly iable and this suggests that their recycled crustal sources have changed through geological time.ldquoThe beauty of our global dataset is that it extends back over two billion years and so these unique alkaline rocks represent an extremely powerful record for understanding crustal recycling over Earth history.ldquoBy carefully bringing together the igneous and sedimentary isotope records, this might allow us to understand how changing crustal input is tied to volcanic output, and ultimately build a much better understanding of what happens to tectonic plates once they get transported into the deep Earth.It is not the first time that Greenland has been picked to try and uncover some of the Earthrsquos mysteries. Some scientists have previously believed Greenland may have been home to a mud volcano where le on Earth may actually began.Researchers discovered the chemical elements crucial to the formation of le in mud volcanoes at Isua in south-west Greenland.It was believed le began in underwater geysers, but research conducted eight years ago argued that these could not have sustained le, and that the volcanoes offered the oldest environment where le could begin.The ices of Greenland and Antarctica bear the fingerprints of a monster - a gigantic volcanic eruption in  or  AD that killed tens of thousands and helped trigger one of the worst periods of global cooling in the last , years.And in August, it emerged, that after years of searching, a team of scientists had finally tracked down the source of the eruption.The teamrsquos work laid out evidence that ties the natural disaster to Ilopango, a now-dormant volcano in El Salvador. Researchers estimated that in its sixth-century eruption, Ilopango expelled the equivalent of . cubic miles of dense rock, making it one of the biggest volcanic events on Earth in the last , years. The blast was more than a hundred times bigger than the  Mount St. Helens eruption."},{"url":null,"title":"marie-claire-39-s-easy-sneer-women-39-s-magazines---39-ll-miss","story":"Opening the glossy, handbag sized covers marked a transition from girlhood to womanhood. Prior to that, Irsquod been a regular reader of Mandy and Judy but now, now I was fully adult.From then, I never missed an issue.What lured me in, I think, was the unfettered aspiration of it all. As young women can be prone to, I was never satisfied with myself and here was, essentially, a manual of betterment.The women featured - the models, the celebrities - had perfect skin, swishy hair and fashionable clothing.If I could only add up all the money I spent on skincare having read the promises of epidermal glory, Id likely have enough to pay off my mortgage.Marie Claire came as an addition to Glamour. I liked its serious features, sitting side by side with fashion and beauty. I credit Marie Claire with introducing me to the hardships of women in developing countries, broadening my feminism and introducing me to international news.Thats right, a womans glossy. Who would have thought But womens magazines have long, long been a Trojan horse, sneaking controversial topics in among the lighter articles - whether thats through the agony aunt pages or simply a strong editorial decision.You wouldnt think it because its so easy to sneer at womens magazines - heavy on the advertising, heavier on the fluff. Melt your back fat, how to wear neon yellow eye shadow, buy these shoes at pound a pop. And its so easy to sneer at things aimed at women, to fail to take womens likes and choices seriously.Readers could learn about miscarriage and also about how to make shorts appropriate office wear, learn about hemlines and headlines.They helped to define mainstream feminism and, in the popularity contest of publicity, often went awry - Glamour, say, giving its annual Women of the Year Award tohellip Bono. A man, and not a very popular man at the best of times.The magazine was also an early adopter of the currents trans rights debate, sparky controversy when giving the newly transitioned Caitlyn Jenner the same award.Some of the most read political coverage has come from womens mags: from Teen Voguersquos op-ed on Donald Trump gas lighting America to Michael Howard being grilled on his views on abortion by Cosmopolitan magazine during the  election.When broadsheet newspapers treated ldquowomenrsquos issues as a separate, less worthy topic to be handled by one dedicated page and tabloid papers dealt with women exclusively as sex objects, womenrsquos magazines gave a voice and a place for the things that mattered to women.In an industry where female editors were a minority, magazines allowed women to reach the top. Female writers with serious clout have contributed to womens magazines: Joan Didion at Vogue Glamour had Susan Orlean and Gloria Steinem while Betty Friedan used a commission for Good Housekeeping to rip apart the medium.I cant pinpoint the moment that I stopped reading womens magazines. Partly I simply didnt have the time - there was no natural point in my day for me to pause with a magazine. Mostly I simply no longer needed the services of Glamour or Marie Claire.It slowly dawned on me over a long awakening that the pound skin cream wasnt making any discernible dferent to anything other than my bank account. I would never buy any of the clothes in any of the features because they were out of my price range.By now my current affairs came from newspapers instead.Its not the case that magazines failed to move with the times. They very much did, backing the trend towards body positivity rather than thinness at any cost introducing more politics and current affairs becoming more erse in the models they used.Magazines, though, are always aspirational, no matter how down to earth or wholesome they try to appear. Even when serious subjects were tackled in one section, there was also still the subtle message pervading the rest of the pages that you could and should be more beautul, more fashionable and buy more stuff.Buying a magazine became a bit of an event - something for a flight or a long train journey. Something to switch off with.And so it came to the point with Glamour I didnrsquot notice that, in , it had gone web-only. If there was anything I did need, I would Google it. You would think somebody working in an industry dependent on print sales would be more mindful of paying for a product, but no.I wasnt alone in giving up my monthly glossies. Marie Claire has recently too joined the ranks of the digital first, that publishing half le of having no print edition.The internet has everything the mags offered: online magazines cover feminism, beauty vloggers deal with lipstick and food websites cover cookery.What the web lacks is scrutiny. Magazines had teams of fact checkers. Editors had accountability - think of the backlash against skinny models that saw the glossies called to explain themselves to politicians.Theres no road back now for the web only publications but lets hope we dont regret what comes to fill their place."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-pride-flag-proms-big-moment-inclusivity","story":"Lucky because that yearrsquos programme included Chocircros No.  by Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the combined choral forces of the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus. The sound they created was huge, uplting and utterly enveloping, and experiencing it was by far the highlight not just of that night but of any orchestral performance I had seen before or since. Even now, a decade later, I get goosebumps just thinking about it.The second half, though, I think my dad and I could both have taken or left. All that pomp and circumstance didnrsquot really sit too easy with us and I am pretty sure we were the only ones in the audience not to stand and holler during the highly theatrical rendition of the Thomas Arne staple, Rule, Britannia. It wasnrsquot just that lyrics about Britons flourishing ldquogreat and free at the expense of nations ldquonot so blest as thee grated, but that all the flag-waving and singing along felt more than a little bit daft. The whole thing just wasnrsquot very us.But thatrsquos the thing about The Proms: despite many of its concerts pushing musical boundaries despite a programme of free discussion events shedding light on the seeming impenetrability of classical music and despite the availability of thousands of pound promming tickets meaning those of slender means still have some hope of managing to attend, for too many people The Proms is the last night, the last night is the second half and the second half just isnrsquot for them. Given that itrsquos all so very British Empire, with all the negative connotations that that brings, can you blame them Only this year the final event of the eight-week extravaganza was a little bit dferent. Yes, there was the usual patriotic fare, with Henry Woodrsquos Fantasia on British Sea-Songs, Edward Elgarrsquos Land of Hope and Glory, Hubert Parryrsquos Jerusalem and ndash of course ndash Rule, Britannia all featuring. And, yes, there was plenty of union flaggery. But this year there was something  too: a self-styled ldquoqueer girl with a nose ring using an event that to some symbolises the pinnacle of cultural exclusivity to take a very public stand in the name of inclusivity.American mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton has seemingly never been one to conform, with her love of opera representing ldquoan act of musical rebellion against parents who raised her to the sounds of bluegrass, the Grateful Dead and The Beatles. Having come out as bisexual in , she used her appearance at this yearrsquos Proms finale to stage another act of rebellion, subverting the chauvinistic undertones and overtones of Rule, Britannia by performing it in the colours of the bisexual flag while waving the distinctive rainbow Pride flag high above her head.It was a gesture, she said, that was designed to ldquomake a very clear statement of pride, tweeting afterwards that ldquoit was an honour to wave a flag that stands for inclusivity, ersity, and above all, love.Her actions certainly had a positive effect for some, with the Proms audience in the Albert Hall breaking into spontaneous applause when Ms Barton held her flag aloft and the journalist James Ball, global editor at The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, tweeting that Ms Bartonrsquos actions represented ldquoa moment for inclusivity. A colleague of mine said witnessing that moment was ldquowonderful, adding that ldquoas a gay man, it brought tears to my eyes.Not everyone felt that way, though. Jordan Daly, co-founder of LGBT visibility charity Time for Inclusive Education, spoke for many when he tweeted thatMs Barton waving the Pride flag during Rule, Britannia was a moment it was ldquoa crass one. ldquoA rainbow flag during Rule Britannia \" he wrote. ldquoThere are LGBT people suffering the worst violence and discrimination across parts of the Commonwealth because of the cultural impact of the British Empirersquos exported homophobia and sodomy laws. Save this.I can certainly see his point. After all, wasnrsquot it the glorication of empire ndash of the ldquodread and envy Britons could instil in others ndash that kept my dad and me in our seats back in   And there is no doubt that colonial-era laws are still blighting the lives of LGBT people the world over, with India only last year overturning British-born legislation that banned consensual gay sex on the basis it was an ldquounnatural act, while it is estimated that close to  former British-administered countries continue to criminalise homosexuality. It is a shameful legacy of a shameful time in our collective history that not one of us can be proud of.Yet to dismiss the waving of a Pride flag during that particular song, in that particular segment of that particular event, would seem to miss the signicance of the moment entirely.In modern times at least the finale of The Last Night of the Proms has always been something of a camp affair. The Rule, Britannia my dad and I saw back in  was no exception, with mezzo-soprano Sarah Connolly, a singer famed for playing so-called breeches roles, strutting onto the Albert Hall stage dressed as Lord Nelson, saluting and scowling like the best of pantomime villains. Yet despite that it has never seemed a particularly inclusive affair ndash until now.Of course itrsquos right to question whether operatic pieces like Rule, Britannia, whose words most certainly leave plenty to be desired, have a place on modern concert programmes. And of course the idea of revelling in an age-old image of Britishness at this particular moment in history will be repugnant to many. But anything that shows that traditions like the Last Night of the Proms are not the preserve of traditionalists, that meanings can be changed and that membership \"rules\" can be relaxed, has got to be recognised for what it is ndash a moment. More than anything, though, Jamie Bartonrsquos moment was A Moment not in spite of its setting, but because of it. That is something we should all be able to take pride in."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-unionist-aim-now-redraw-indyref2-mandate","story":"Presumably,polls suggest support stands at or near that figure the barrier could be raised to  per cent, or  per cent of those registered to vote :Petition launched to require two-thirds majority for independenceMr Smith does not seem to understand that in UK democracy the tradition has been that success is one vote more than anyone . For instance, much to the great surprise of public opinion, David Cameron won a majority at the  election. This allowed him to hold the in out EU referendum the following year, and as a result of this the UK will shortly leave the EU.

The focus is shting from winning the argument to redefining what winning means.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.DAVID Roxburghrsquos letteris a masterpiece, unambiguous and as clear as a mountain stream and filled with good sense.The only point with which I would disagree, slightly, is his suggestion that a - rule be applied to all referendums. As it is in the United States, a two-thirds majority would be much fairer for all constitutional referendums in every corner of the UK.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.WILLIE Rennie bases implacable opposition to a second independence referendum on a \"promise\" that the  vote was a \"once in a generation\" event. As Nick Clegg could remind him, campaign promises can come back to bite political parties. Sir Nick \"promised\" not to increase university tuition fees. He did. Better Together \"promised\" that voting No would secure Scotlandrsquos place in Europe. It didnrsquot. The SNPrsquos promise in its  Holyrood manesto was conditional: the Scottish Government should have the right to hold a democratic event \" there is a signicant and material change in the circumstanceshellip such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". Dragging Scotland out of the EU defies the  percent who voted to remain. No democrat should deny Holyrood the means of honouring such a clear vote.: A pro-independence majority at Holyrood is not a mandate for another referendumSimply setting aside the EU referendum result might be the LibDems latest style but Mr Rennie would do better to observe the Edinburgh Agreementrsquos aspirations for the referendum. Its terms sought a process that \"should deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect\". The  loss of the referendum was followed by an unprecedented SNP landslide in  SNP majority of seats in  and  an overwhelming SNP majority in rsquos EU election. These indicators, plus opinion poll increases in support for both independence and a second ballot, suggest that the people of Scotland ndash to whom politicians are accountable ndash appear increasingly minded not to respect the result from . If the single expectation was that the result would command respect there was no indication that that respect would be mandatory. The \"settled will\" of . percent in Scotland who voted to reconvene the Scottish Parliament has been respected the No vote settled nothing.Before Mr Rennie boxes himself into a \"no deal\" position he should reflect on Scottish historical intellectual flexibility. Hugh MacDiarmid observed that the \"constant effort\" of Patrick Geddes was \"to help people to think for themselves, and to think round the whole circle, not in scraps and bits\". Scotlandrsquos independent future maps onto that \"whole circle\" of which collaborative, broad and cross-community consensus will form part. As MacDiarmid observed of Geddes \"he knew that watertight compartments are useful only to a sinking ship\".

Many in England see Scotland as standing in their countryrsquos way, so the Scots should lsquof*** offrsquo and many Scots would happily lsquof*** offrsquo to be rid of the union.Of course, therersquos many English and Scots who think in much more sophisticated terms, and plenty whorsquove nothing but feelings of friendship for their fellow countrymen and women on the other side of the border, but therersquos something in the harshness and simplicity of the insult which speaks of disturbing truths when it comes to Scotland and England. The narrative is one of uneasiness, simmering anger, growing distrust, and a sense that, as things stand, wersquod probably be best going our own separate ways before it gets worse.That three-word hashtag is in essence the public expression of a signicant slice of popular opinion. A vocal group in one part of the union - England - is telling an entire other part of the union - Scotland - to sling its hook in no uncertain terms. England is sick of Scotland, and the Scots are no longer wanted. Thatrsquos what the insult symbolises.Support for and against independence is fairly evenly split ndash a poll in August showed Yes on  and No on , a poll this month had Yes at  and No at  ndash so the insult backfired from the get-go. You canrsquot really tell someone to get lost when theyrsquore already heading for the door.Independence supporters began rfing on the insult, saying on social media just how desperate they were lsquoto f*** offrsquo. Irsquoll get my coat, seemed to be the overwhelming response. Many Scots took the insult and kicked it straight back at those doling it out.Insults are curious things ndash they often say more about the people wielding the words than those on the receiving end. If you have to turn to insults then yoursquove probably lost the argument. So, when it came to lsquoF*** Off Scotlandrsquo, the words said more about the emptiness of English nationalism, than they managed to hurt the nation or people of Scotland, which was the intention after all.Social media is the curse of humanity ndash a bottomless pit of stupidity and cruelty ndash but it does reflect our darkest thoughts, perhaps darkest truths, back at us. And here it was showing us the basest thoughts, the most disappointing truths, about the relationship between Scotland and England.The crudity of lsquoF*** Off Scotlandrsquo is reflected in more nuanced polling. UK-wide surveys show widespread support for a second independence referendum and a poll on a united Ireland. When Donrsquot Knows are removed,  per cent favour a second Scottish independence ballot, and  per cent support a vote on Irish unity. Some could read those figures as a large proportion of the rest of the UK saying lsquowhy donrsquot you troublesome Celts have your vote and go - let England get on with her affairs without your interferencersquo.Why would Scotland and Ulster want to hang around  Brexit has eaten British democracy alive, and risks undermining the rule of law.

Back then, the EU was certainly not on the side of independence. Scotland was told by Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy that the country ldquowould remain outside the European Unionit voted for independence. Even Ireland said an independent Scotland would have a long wait after applying for EU membership.

A number of alternative sites had been discounted as a result of being either too large, too small, or unavailable.A planning report to committee stated: “The proposals would provide both local trades and members of the public with a range of DIY products from an established home improvement company and thus can be considered as a benefit to the local community.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"These are the most popular Disney inspired names\"  These are the  most popular Disney-inspired names viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"call for shops to close on new year s day","story":"The shopworkers# trade union is urging all MSPs to back a motion calling for the closure of large shops in New Year#s Day.A survey of Scottish retail staff by the union Usdaw shows overwhelming support for the closure of stores on January .And the union is now calling on all MSPs to support the motion tabled by Jackie Baillie MSP in the Scottish Parliament seeking to ensure shop workers can enjoy some time off at New Year.The survey of more than  shop workers revealed:•  per cent believed stores should close on New Year’s Day, with  per cent saying they should also close on January .• Three quarters feel they spend too little time with friends and family over New Year.•  per cent have come under pressure to work on New Year’s Day or January .• Four in ten don’t receive any premium pay for working on New Year’s Day.•  per cent are not happy to work on New Year’s Day or January .Stewart Forrest, Usdaw’s Scottish isional officer, said: “This survey clearly demonstrates the strength feeling among our members. “We have written to all MSPs asking them to support Jackie Baillie’s motion calling for a decent break at New Year after the busy Christmas period.“I have also written to the Scottish Retail Consortium urging them to reconsider their opposition to large stores closing on New Year’s Day.”Mr Forrest stressed the union was fully supportive of efforts to revitalise our high streets as the livelihoods of its members depended on a thriving retail sector.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carricktoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Rev Ian McLachlan\"  Sad farewell at Girvan South Parish ChurchviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carricktoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The taskforce will examine the causes of drug-related deaths, and seek solutions to prevent the use of drugs resulting in the loss of so many lives.\"  New taskforce begins work to tackle rise in drug deaths viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"CARR | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"CARR | Article Teaser\"But he added: “Usdaw does not accept that giving retail workers in large stores just one more day of guaranteed time off would have a negative impact on our high streets, as  per cent of our members who worked on New Year’s Day  said that their store was either very quiet or fairly quiet.”Jackie Baillie MSP said retail staff worked incredibly hard all year round, and were often on their feet for long shts.

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We have seen consistent growth, and demand for Scottish products like machinery, food and drink continue to rise across the globe.However, the ongoing uncertainty of a looming no-deal Brexit poses a huge threat to jobs, businesses and our economy and I fear these impacts are becoming more pronounced.The publication last week of the UK Government’s assessment of the likely impact of and preparedness for a no-deal Brexit sets out the stark and grim reality of the dangers we are facing.Under no-deal, according to the UK Government, delays to freight would mean delays to goods in and out of the UK, causing issues for importers and exporters as well as manufacturers. Fresh food supply will decrease and financial services – one of Scotland’s largest industries – will be disrupted. There may be fuel disruption and impacts at Scotland’s only refinery at Grangemouth. All of which points to a major dislocation for our economy.That’s the base or worst-case no-deal situation – and it’s a situation which, at this point in the Brexit negotiations, puts our economy in jeopardy.It is hardly a surprise that, faced with these prospects, overseas orders are falling as companies in other countries aren’t willing to take the risk to buy products or invest in services that they don’t know they will receive.: Path open for independent Scotland to ‘walk into’ EU membershipFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereThe economic implications of leaving the EU with no-deal will be disastrous for Scotland and could push the country into recession. The Fraser of Allander Institute has said no-deal could equate to GDP in Scotland being £ billion lower and unemployment rising to nearly double the current rate. That level of contraction would more than wipe out the last two years’ growth in the economy and the gains in employment.But it’s not just no-deal, even an orderly Brexit will have an impact. The European single market and customs union is particularly vital to the Scottish economy and is eight times bigger than the UK market alone. More than half of all Scottish goods we exported in the last three months were sent to Europe and over the past year, goods exports to Europe have increased by . per cent to £. billion.And a Brexit that saw Northern Ireland able to benefit from continued alignment or membership with the single market or customs union while Scotland is dragged further away would put us at a real competitive disadvantage.: Boris Johnson ‘working flat out’ on Brexit deal as he meets Juncker: Brexit: Boris Johnson lied about his alleged lie to the Queen – Brian WilsonWe are already seeing the impact Brexit and the threat of no deal is having on business and consumer confidence in Scotland with an increase in stockpiling and reduced investment intentions.Consumer sentiment in Scotland has been negative since the EU referendum and we’ve seen it deteriorate further in the first half of the year.Last week our unemployment figures, whilst low, began to rise suggesting a slow-down in the labour market.Every day brings new warning bells.The UK Government cannot simply claim this isn’t happening, when every independent study highlights the risk Brexit poses and the damage being done. Temporary boosts in activity as people and businesses stockpile ahead of approaching deadlines are beneficial on the surface, but they speak to the dangerous situation we are in.Figures showing negative growth in the UK in the last quarter should not simply be discounted as a blip.Now I am an optimist and a believer that Scotland and Scotland’s business community are incredibly resilient. The recovery from the financial crash shows what can be done and the progress in industries such as renewable energy, food-and-drink and tourism shows that we can tap into new markets, that our expertise is valued, and our exports valuable.Through our work as a Government, we are taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit at the same time as we continue to work to make our economy fit for a low-carbon, high-innovation future.Our Future Skills Action Plan will help ensure Scotland has a skilled and productive workforce which is resilient to future economic challenges.We are continuing to increase investment in RD, our export plan seeks to ensure we are not just fighting back against the impact of Brexit but targeting key markets and key industries that have real growth potential.We will build on that in the next year with an action plan to boost inward investment and the early stage investments of the Scottish National Investment Bank.We aim to combat the potential fall in population as a result of Brexit, with campaigns to ensure EU citizens know Scotland is their home and they are welcome and efforts to secure an immigration policy that fits Scotland’s needs.And we are engaging with business organisations across Scotland and seeking to address their concerns to mitigate any drop in economic activity and to remove constraints to trade. This includes providing bespoke information for how businesses can prepare for Brexit and supporting access to finance, for businesses of all sizes.We will continue to do all of that and more, against the backdrop of this deeply damaging Brexit, but I must be honest that not every impact of Brexit can be mitigated.Of course, the easiest way to tackle this is to prevent Brexit and we will keep working to do that. The economic damage already being done shows why standing up to this UK Government is so important.Scotland did not vote to leave the EU and we continue to stand firm against efforts to take us out of the EU against our will.Derek Mackay is Finance Secretary and SNP MSP for Renfrewshire North and West©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dark skies and economic progress are both important leader comment","story":"For centuries, light has been associated with economic and philosophical progress.And so it might seem a bit odd, in the home of the Scottish Englightenment, to be extolling the virtues of darkness.But modern science has demonstrated the importance of both light and dark to the human body clock as well as the rhythms of the natural world.

In an embarrassing scene for the UK Prime Minister, Mr Bettel addressed the media on his own, next to an empty podium.Mr Johnson went into yesterday’s talks insisting he would not request an extension to the UK’s  October EU exit date, despite a legal obligation to do sono deal has been agreed with Brussels in the next month.However, with the EU saying it is the UK’s responsibility to put forward alternative plans for the Irish border in order to make progress in talks, MEPs will gather in Strasbourg tomorrow to vote on endorsing a Brexit delay.Ms Ritchie said there was support in the Renew group – the third largest in the European Parliament – and beyond for a much longer extension than the three-month minimum set out in legislation passed by MPs to block a no-deal Brexit.“If we ask for an extension, we will be given longer than three months – I think six months minimum,” she told The Scotsman. “As you will know, French sources are mooting a two-year extension.“My view is that it would be preferablethe extension was to the end of the current parliament, on the basis that we stop bugging Brussels every six months, we take proper time to sort out what we want, and can get our Parliament to approve, and go back to them.“That would stop the constant clf-edge negotiation or bluffing and reintroduce some stability for all parties. That view has some support in the Renew Europe Group and the wider European Parliament.”Over a working lunch in Luxembourg, Mr Juncker reminded the Prime Minister it was “the UK’s responsibility to come forward with legally operational solutions” to the issues around the Irish border. In a statement, the EU Commission said “proposals have not yet been made”.A Downing Street spokesman said that talks between British and EU officials would intensy further and “would soon take place on a daily basis”.Amid speculation that a deal could be accompanied by a longer post-Brexit transition period, Mr Johnson also said after the talks that EU regulations would cease to apply at the end of December , limiting the time available to negotiate the UK’s future trade relationship with Brussels.Officials from the UK and Luxembourg governments sought to pin the blame on each other after the joint press conference turned into a solo address by Mr Bettel, while Mr Johnson was jeered as he left.Referring to the protesters – British citizens living in Luxembourg – Mr Bettel said: “Our people need to know what is going to happen to them in six weeks’ time. They need clarity, they need certainty and they need stability.“You can’t hold their future hostage for party political gains.”Gesturing to the empty podium where Mr Johnson should have been, the Luxembourg prime minister added: “Now it’s on Mr Johnson – he holds the future of all UK citizens and every EU citizen living in the UK in his hands.“It’s his responsibility.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

She said it has hindered the Tories ability to negotiate neutrally with the DUP, and that they seek to \"placate\" the party rather than hold meaningful talks on restoring a government in Northern Ireland.\"Julian Smith says the Prime Minister wants to have power-sharing restored, andthats the case then they need to get cracking and need to get real,\" Ms McDonald said.\"They say that itis priority, but you would imaginesomething is a priority they would move heaven and earth to make it happen, and were certainly not convinced that the British Government have carried the load or used their influence with the DUP to ensure that solutions are delivered. \"This is the frustrating thing.\"Stormont has been in cold storage for more than two-and-half-years due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the DUP on issues such as Irish language legislation and a ban on same-sex marriage.Hopes for a new set of talks were sparked following the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee in April, but Ms McDonald said that although talks are ongoing, nothing substantial is expected any time soon.\"We still are in a situation where the DUP are not demonstrating the necessary appetite to embrace solutions to issues to get the assembly back up and running, and neither are the British Government in terms of restoring power-sharing or indeed agreeing or embracing thebackstop to protect the island of Ireland,\" she added.\"Not being unkind to the man , the reality is that any British secretary of state or Tory coming here... they dont have the same skin in the game in terms of Irish interests that other people who have been elected here have.\"Ms McDonald said some points were discussed with Mr Smith, but these did not include whether or not the DUP would accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop.Sinn Fein said it is looking at any upcoming general election at Westminster as \"an opportunity for all of us to show that Northern Ireland voted to remain\".Ms McDonald did not rule out having the party stand aside in the hotly contested South Belfast seat in order to enable another pro-remain candidate to take a greater share of the vote against the incumbent DUP MP."},{"url":null,"title":"american behind film of martin mcguinness with bomb was suspected cia agent","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They came to us. They sent for us at that time.

Adams and Martin McGuinness were both on the republican team whose chief demand was for a British commitment to withdraw from Northern Ireland.The talks collapsed and shortly afterwards sectarian tensions in Belfast boiled over as Catholics fled their homes but were stopped from occupying vacated Protestant houses in the west of Belfast.“That was the end of the ceasefire,” says former IRA man Tommy Gorman.The Provisionals resumed their offensive and on Bloody Friday nine people were killed and  injured as the IRA unleashed  bombs across Belfast.Brendan DuddyLord Ramsbotham, who was aide to the Army’s most senior officer here, told the Spotlight documentary that Bloody Friday provided an “admirable excuse” for the start of Operation Motorman to get rid of the no-go areas.Some , soldiers were deployed in what was the biggest military operation of the Troubles.The Army met little or no resistance and MacIntyre says that was because of the late Derry businessman Brendan Duddy, who had contacts within the IRA and the RUC.Duddy was at the centre of a secret agreement to reduce the possibility of bloodshed by removing more than  Provisional weapons from the city.Duddy — who died in May  — was to become a vital conduit between the British and the IRA in their discussions for the rest of the Troubles."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/7857c/BINARY/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be

Heath might have been [willing to do so].”Lord Armstrong, who is now , also said that in the s the government believed it was its “duty” to take part in secret talks with IRA lest a way could be found to prevent bloodshed.Former IRA leader Billy McKee said that he had met with British representatives over a dozen times and was “convinced they were very serious”, with the possibility of British withdrawal on the table.NI Human Rights Commission: ‘Unborn child has no human rights’Boris Johnson pulls out of press conference because of pro-E.U. protesters - leaves lecetern empty as Luxembourg P.M.

The footage, which Spotlight said had never been broadcast, was for an American programme called Secret Army and was filmed at the point in the early s where the IRA believed it was on the brink of victory. Last week Spotlight broadcast footage from the same film which showed Martin McGuinness taking part in a car bombing.An Anglican minister has said that when he and other clerics secretly met the IRA in December  they were doing so on behalf of the government.The Rev Ralph Baxter and seven other Protestant clergymen met the IRA leadership at a hotel in Feakle, County Clare, but the meeting failed when Garda raided the hotel.The Rev Baxter, now an elderly man, was forced to flee to Canada after UDA threats in the wake of the talks being revealed.Speaking for the first time about the incident, he told Spotlight that the clerics had “Harold Wilson’s blessing”.He said: “We met with them on behalf of the British government...we didn’t have any other role.”He said that the IRA leadership “wanted peace because they wanted out why they wanted out is another thing altogether”.l The second episode of Spotlight On The Troubles: A Secret History will be shown tonight at pm on BBC One NI and

At present abortion in NI is only lawful where a woman’s health is seriously at risk.David Smyth of the Evangelical Alliancesaid official figures from England and Wales last year show % of abortions involved “physically healthy women aborting physically healthy babies”. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Similarly, he claimed, there will be no explicit safeguards in NI to prevent abortions ongrounds of disability or unwanted gender and that most will happen “because a human child is unwanted”. Yet the commission is raising no concern, he said, because “it does not believe that the unborn child is entitled to any protection before birth under human rights law”.But Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the NI Human Rights Commission, responded that the analysis and criticism “was neither accurate nor fair”.The only change, he said,will be that it is “no longer possible to take criminal prosecutions against, for example, women and clinicians”.Other regulations will remain in place, he said, including clinicians’ professional duties, “other criminal offences” and Department of Health guidance.He noted that the UK Supreme Court found that NI abortion law is contrary to a woman’s right to personal and bodily autonomy. Under common law, he said, it found that “the foetus or unborn child, while having some statutory protection, has no free-standing human right, rather such rights are inextricably linked to the rights of the woman”.From March , he said, NI law will meet the recommendations of an inquiry into NI abortion law by the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. “This concluded that current NI law has led to systematic violations of human rights against women who are compelled to travel to undergo legal abortions, self-administer pills or carry a pregnancy to full term.”Gerry Adams sat opposite me on the army council, says IRA man Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The UN inquiry recommended access to abortion, he said, where there is a serious threat to a woman’s health, in cases of rape and incest and for “severe foetal impairment”. He added: “The picture painted by the Evangelical Alliance ranges far beyond what the recent legislation in Westminster requires.”Mr Smyth responded: “The commission has still failed to answer the key question – whether it advocates any human rights protection for a child before it is born.” • Monday’s News Letter reported Mr Smyth as saying that NI’s new abortion legislation would leave Down’s syndrome pregnancies without any legal protection here – unlike in England and Wales. Mr Smyth has pointed out, however, that legal protections for Down’s syndrome pregnancies in England and Wales are minimal, that % are terminated and that he expects a similar rate to occur in NI

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukCarrick firefighters form guard of

Kelly Gardens in the Co Armagh town, qualied as a pharmacist in , graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams. I know mum and dad were glad to see me get through it.”\"  \"  Malcolm McKeown Murder: Police release C.C.T.V. footage of car used by gunmanTop teacher warns on mental health time bomb over autism

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
