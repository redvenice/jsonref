And similar temperatures are expected again this weekend.  Eighty per cent of new Covid-19 cases in one badly-hit part of Greater Manchester are among white people, according to a local official.Councillors in other parts of the North West — including Blackburn — have warned spikes in coronavirus cases are being driven by the Asian community.But Eleanor Roaf, director of public health in Trafford, says cases in the borough — home to 235,000 people — are centered in the \u0027nice leafy suburbs\u0027.She fears a \u0027complacent white middle class\u0027 will wrongly believe the disease is \u0027not affecting them because it\u0027s about overcrowding in ethnic minority families\u0027.Official NHS figures show the infection rate in Trafford, one of the wealthiest of the 10 boroughs in Greater Manchester, is now starting to decline.The borough saw 32.6 cases for every 100,000 people between July 26 and August 1 — 10 per cent lower than the week before.Separate data released on Friday showed Trafford\u0027s infection rate had tripled in just one week, from 10.2 to 36.8.Only one authority in Greater Manchester — Wigan — is not named in the list of the 20 areas with the highest infection rates in England."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f0ab3a92e4eed4e1562042acd5601e76c0e32a/0_294_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55475f9685e2713e14a853fe88c2e2a","title":"10 summer wellness ideas for you and your family","story":"With the school holidays here and lockdown measures easing up around the country, now is the time to stretch those legs and get some exercise while remaining safe and within social distancing guidelinesThere’s nothing like a global pandemic to make us re-evaluate what’s really important in life and for many of us, it’s our health. Tight restrictions on where we’ve been able to go and what we’ve been able to do have boosted the sales of fitness equipment as we’ve looked for ways to stay in shape, while staying safe.For many, this unprecedented situation has strained both our physical and mental wellbeing, but with lockdown measures easing and warmer weeks ahead, now is the time to renew good intentions and get more physically active.“Lockdown has knocked our health balance,” says Claire Davis, a fitness coach at wellness retreat 38 Degrees North. “We’ve eaten and drunk too much, exercised less than normal and succumbed to bad habits, increasing our stress levels. But summer is the ideal time to make healthy changes.”So whether your aim is to lose the odd lockdown pound, feel fitter or just stay strong enough to weather life’s next big storm, this is the perfect time to make the changes you’ve been daydreaming about.1. Borrow a dogSpoiler alert: walking is perhaps the best exercise there is as it’s low impact, can be done anywhere and almost anyone of any fitness level can get involved, for free.Just 15 minutes of moderate walking can see you cover about a mile’s worth of ground, so it’s easily one of the best ways to get out and get moving. Getting kids excited about going for a walk can be challenging, so why not lure them with the temptation of a furry friend for company? Borrow a neighbour’s dog to take to the local park or check out dog-lending websites such as borrowmydoggy to find a pooch in your area that may need its legs stretching.2. Pick local produceBecause of lockdown, the pick-your-own season has had a bit of a slow start, but many farms have now applied social distancing measures and reopened for business. A morning or afternoon picking your own fruit and veg is not only wholesome family fun (whisper it: exercise), but it also supports local businesses, and ticks the environmentally friendly box as it means fresh groceries without all of the unnecessary shrink-wrap. A quick Google should help locate your local farms (or try pickyourownfarms.org.uk) and remember to call to check opening times and crop availability ahead of your visit.3. Go for a dipSummer is the perfect time for outdoor swimming, whether that’s at your local lido (call and check that they’ve reopened) or somewhere a little more wild. There’s something extremely invigorating about braving the elements and swimming outdoors, and the UK is studded with rivers, lakes, ponds and beaches that are clean and safe to swim in.Wild swimming is loaded with health benefits, from lowering stress hormones to improving circulation and reducing inflammation, plus a 30-minute session in cold water can burn almost 400 calories. Visit wildswimming for locations close to you.4. Raise your voicePeople underestimate the fitness potential of a good old sing-song, but belting out a few tunes can burn calories, strengthen the diaphragm and pump more oxygen around the body than many other forms of aerobic exercise. It’s also brilliant for mental health – reducing stress, boosting self-confidence and releasing endorphins.Most local choirs remain on hold due to Covid-19 but many are holding virtual sing-alongs (check out singforfun).5. Hit the dance floorIt might be a while before nightclubs reopen, but dancing is a brilliant form of exercise and can be done right this second. Not only is dance a brilliant all-over aerobic workout, there is also a unique sense of freedom and empowerment that comes from moving your body to music, perfect for pepping yourself up post-lockdown.Dance instructor Illana Gambrill was so overwhelmed by people desperate to get back to Dancebox – her Essex-based classes – that she’s created a weekly online programme that is easy to sign up to, simple to follow and a bona fide saviour for mind, body and soul.6. Eat alfrescoWeather permitting, there is nothing more satisfying than sharing a meal with friends and family outdoors – the feelgood factor itself does much to boost our wellbeing. It is also thought to be of great benefit to children as outdoor eating – such as picnics and barbecues – often goes hand-in-hand with playdates and family bonding time. Fire up the coals or get a disposable barbecue to grill fish or lean cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or pork fillets, which are a healthier substitute for fatty burgers and sausages.Experiment with different marinades and simple side salads, invite some friends and don’t forget your brolly for the quintessential British experience. Fingers crossed you won’t need it.7. Learn to hulaHula hooping might conjure up visions of 1980s lycra-clad fitness types, or seem more like vintage child’s play, but it can actually burn as much fat as treadmill exercises, and other benefits include toning muscles and strengthening your heart.Advocates reckon that 10 minutes of hula-ing a day will see results and the plastic hoop should only set you back a couple of quid from a general store (although if you’re feeling fancy, a weighted one can be purchased for less than the cost of your average round at the pub). With minimal kit required and plenty of tutorials available online, this is an amazing way to start getting active again after the long lockdown break.8. Go geocachingImagine that you could be a part of the world’s biggest treasure hunt the moment you step out your door. Geocaching is exactly that. This free outdoor activity is suitable for all ages and uses the GPS on your smartphone to allow you to hide and seek secret containers at specific locations, marked by coordinates all over the world.Getting you out and about, turning you into real-life Lara Crofts – this is a brilliantly fun activity for the whole family. And with more than 3m caches to find, there’s bound to be something to sniff out near you. Register for a free basic membership at geocaching.9. Get out in the gardenThere is increasing evidence that gardening provides substantial health benefits – just interacting with flora lowers our cortisol, improving mood and mental health. You can also burn about 330 calories doing one hour of light gardening, plus when you’re outdoors your body makes vitamin D, which strengthens bones, although you should still apply sunscreen.If you don’t have a garden, search online for a local community gardening initiative failing that, plant some salad leaves in indoor pots. Growing your own food helps children develop a lasting habit of eating fresh vegetables and might make them more likely to try new (green) things.10. Walk and workFor many, lockdown has forced us to re-evaluate the way we work, revealing our astounding ability to multitask. So post lockdown, consider the ways in which you could make your regular working day that bit more active.Need to schedule a 30-minute meeting? Do what Steve Jobs was fond of and have a walking meeting instead. Or if somebody wants to meet up to talk business over coffee, suggest making it a takeaway and having a stroll. You can also extend these multitasking habits outside of work hours with a spot of “temptation bundling” – pairing something you love with an activity you’re trying to do more of.

He also tweeted that state support “must continue and intensify” to save the wine industry from collapse.Today’s ADP payroll report has alarmed Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. She fears that the US government’s own jobs report, due in 48 hours, could be weaker than hoped.Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics is more upbeat. He still reckons Friday’s Non-Farm Payroll will show an extra one million jobs created in July.On today’s ADP report, he says:The details suggest the slowdown was driven by the leisure and hospitality sector which, after adding close to 2 million jobs in June, added just 38,000 in July, which would make sense given the renewed restrictions on bars and restaurants in many states. But most other sectors also saw a sharp slowdown. That said, it is worth reiterating that the ADP has never been a great guide to the official payrolls figures and has actually been particularly poor in recent months, with the ADP’s initially published estimates for May and June (which have since been miraculously revised up to better match the official data) proving far too pessimistic. Mohamed El-Erien of Allianz says the ADP jobs report is ‘worrisome’:Asset manager Steven Rattner fears that the employment situation will worsen, if Congress and the White House can’t agree a new stimulus package quickly.ADP reckon that medium-sized US companies actually cut staff in July:ADP’s data is based on actual payroll data, so it should be accurate. But the huge revision to June’s figures show that it’s pretty tricky to judge the economy right now.I’m afraid the ADP Payroll report doesn’t paint a very heartening picture of the US jobs market. ADP have just reported that US companies added 167,000 new workers in July, a long way below the 1.5 million increase which Wall Street had expected.That’s a big miss - suggesting the labor market has slowed last month.But, ADP have also radically revised their earlier data higher. They now reckon that 4.31m jobs were created in June, up from 2.36m they reported a month ago. That brings it more into line with June’s official jobs data.But it certainly creates more uncertainty ahead of Friday’s Non-Farm Payroll report -- with Trump already talking it up.Here’s some snap reaction:More reaction to follow....US president Donald Trump has hinted that the next US employment report, due on Friday, will be decent.July’s non-farm payroll is indeed expected to show a recovery in the labor force. Economists predict that around 1.6 million new jobs were created -- certainly a ‘big’ number, but not as impressive as the 4.8m created in June.We’ll shortly get the latest estimate for private sector payrolls from ADP, which may give an indication of how Friday’s NFP data will play out.It’s been a decent morning for European equities.The main indices are all positive, led by companies which have suffered badly from the pandemic.Here’s the situation on the major bourses:Staff at  Bank won’t be returning to their desk for some time, as the firm tries to avoid getting caught up in a wave of winter illness. Bank will not urge staff to return to the office until the winter flu season is over but it is ramping up hiring to handle a surge in defaults linked to the Covid-19 crisis.The chief executive, Daniel Frumkin, said he would not ask its 1,400 head office and back-office employees to return to their desks before 2021, given the potential for a rise in coronavirus cases during the winter months.“Everybody tells me, you know, flu season will be difficult and it doesn’t seem prudent to let people back in the office in October, staring into a winter that could be very difficult. It seems much more prudent to revisit the topic once we see what the winter unfolds like,” he said. isn’t alone. Many UK firms are taking a cautious approach, having found that home working can be productive, and safer for staff.Data released yesterday showed that US oil inventories have fallen, suggesting stronger demand (or weaker supply) than expected.Oil is also benefiting from the weak US dollar. As this chart shows, many assets are rising against the greenback today.Back in the commodities market, gold has just hit a new record high, extending this morning’s gains.Gold is changing hands at $2,040 per ounce, up from $1,975 at the start of the week (and $1,500 at the start of the year).Having surged through $2,000 overnight, gold looks primed for further gains, according to Adam Vettese, analyst at investment platform eToro: Continued Covid19 uncertainty, combined with central banks and governments flooding their economies with stimulus and aid, has led to increased demand for the precious metal and we could see the rally push on further if current market conditions persist. Low interest rates and bond yields pulling back are also helping the rally. In normal circumstances bonds would be favoured over gold as they have a yield which gold doesn’t, but at current levels that isn’t an attractive option for retail investors.”Sweden’s economy suffered a very sharp contraction in the last quarter - although not quite as severe as European neighbours.“The downturn in GDP is the largest for a single quarter for the period of 1980 and forward.”That reflects the fact that Sweden resisted imposing tough lockdown rules, and instead asked its citizens to behave responsibly. Although some schools did close, and large gatherings were discouraged, shops, restaurants and gyms all remained open - meaning less economic damage.However, that policy was criticised as Sweden’s infection rate rose, particularly in care homes. Sweden’s chief epidemiologist admitted in June that more action should have been taken.Bookmaker William Hill is planning not to reopen 119 branches closed during the coronavirus lockdown - another example of how the pandemic has changed business patterns. Fortunately, though, few job cuts are expected - as my colleague Jasper Jolly explains:It plans to repay the government £24.5m in funds claimed to support furloughed workers’ wages, after revealing profits of £141m in the first six months of 2020, thanks to a £200m VAT refund. The BBC’s Douglas Fraser reports that jobs are also being cut at clothing retailer M\u0026ampCo:In another blow, retail chain WH Smiths is planning to cut up to 1,500 jobs.The company, which operates shops at airports and railway stations and on the high street, has announced it will restructure its UK operations. This proposal could to lead to up to 1,500 roles becoming redundant, it says, adding to the rising total of jobs lost during the pandemic.It blames the impact on passenger numbers due to the slump in demand for air travel, and the move towards home working during the lockdown. Lower footfall on the UK high street is also hurting the business.In a statement to the City WH Smith Group chief executive, Carl Cowling, explains:“Covid-19 continues to have a significant impact on the WH Smith Group. Throughout the pandemic, we have responded quickly and taken decisive actions to protect the business including substantially strengthening our financial position. We have also welcomed support from Government where available.“In our Travel business, while we are beginning to see early signs of recovery in some of our markets, the speed of recovery continues to be slow. At the same time, while there has been some progress in our High Street business, it does continue to be adversely affected by low levels of footfall. As a result, we now need to take further action to reduce costs across our businesses. I regret that this will have an impact on a significant number of colleagues whose roles will be affected by these necessary actions, and we will do everything we can to support them at this challenging time.WH Smiths also told investors that sales are still “materially down” compared with a year ago, despite a gradual recovery since lockdown restrictions have eased.“The headline sentiment number is indeed positive with activity in the UK’s crucial services sector expanding at the fastest rate since July 2015 supported by a surge in new orders.“The issue remains the sustainability of this recovery given the increase in sectoral redundancies and a likely cessation of wider investment until the horizon is seen more clearly, with anything from further lockdowns to Brexit confusion likely to keep businesses in a state of caution.”UK service sector companies cut jobs at a sharper pace in July, because they are worried that the Covid-19 recovery will be slow.So says Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply. He warns that there are still serious ‘underlying problems’ in the economy, even though activity grew last month.Employment fell even more quickly in July as some firms made redundancies in response to worries about the length of the recovery. Although in a small minority, other service providers found new opportunities to hire talent and had the pick of the bunch to fill vacancies from growing numbers of applications. “Consumer choices also still remained cautious with pre-covid spending a distant memory in some categories. As the sector returns to work, increased competition between firms meant that increasing raw materials costs could not be passed on to customers. As the threat of further pandemic lockdown threatens to derail continuing progress, business will have to continue to absorb any additional costs coming their way or face the prospect of having to close their doors permanently.

Rapid swab tests, called LamPORE, and 5,000 machines, supplied by DnaNudge, will soon be available in adult care settings and laboratories. If they’re effective, they could allow for rapid, on-the-spot testing. But there’s no publicly available data about the accuracy of these tests or how they perform, raising concerns about why the government has endorsed – and purchased - them.The lab-free testing machine from DnaNudge is potentially exciting. The government has placed a £161m order for these machines, which are currently being evaluated on saliva. If they work, people could be tested for Covid-19 without having to take the nose or throat swab that many find unpleasant. This has particular advantages in children, though it has a low throughput – each machine can complete only a maximum of 15 tests a day. The developers of the LamPORE swab test say they can complete up to 15,000 tests a day, although no real-world data is publicly available.During the pandemic, the urgency that has produced valuable data has also led to the fast dissemination of research and equipment that isn’t subject to normal systems of evaluation, such as peer review. As clinical researchers, we went looking for information about these two new tests, and could find no data on either, despite the DnaNudge website stating excellent performance in clinical studies. The LamPORE website says that analytical performance testing is “ongoing”.LamPORE and DnaNudge are undoubtedly exciting technologies. But the fact the government announcement didn’t even include a “pre-print” publication (the term given to research that is published prior to undergoing peer review) about either test is concerning. According to Imperial College London, DnaNudge was evaluated from April in eight London hospitals.Nobody wants to hinder the development of new, potentially lifesaving technologies. But in order to fully understand how the tests perform in a lab, pre-clinical testing should be rigorous.For a test to be properly validated, a number of conditions need to be satisfied. This takes time. First, a new diagnostic test designed to look for virus genetic material is assessed in the laboratory, using artificially made genetic segments that look like virus. This artificial sample has a set number of copies of genetic material, and it is then diluted down a number of times. Each diluted sample is tested on the device multiple times to see whether it can be detected reproducibly and reliably.This experiment provides what’s known as the detection limit of the test, expressed as the number of “virus” genetic copies in each millilitre of water that can be picked up by the test. The test needs to be run with only water repeated times to check that there are no “false positive” results.Next, you take a nose or throat swab from a Covid-19 negative inidual and “spike” the sample with some of the artificial genetic material from coronavirus, in order to check that the swab or the secretions that are collected do not interfere with the test. Again, multiple tests are done with varying amounts of genetic material in the “spiked” sample.The next step is to access a bank of swabs from patients known to be positive and negative in what’s known as a “gold standard” lab test, such as the tests developed by Public Health England that can quantify the amount of virus present in a person with Covid-19 symptoms. Large numbers of these positive samples, perhaps 50 or more, are tested with the new device. It’s just as important to test a large number of samples from non-Covid iniduals to check that no “false positives” arise.The final step is to test the new device in real time, against a gold-standard test. This step is the most challenging as it sometimes requires ethical approval, and must be done in a clinical environment in real time. When we tested the rapid portable device,  Samba II, in Cambridge, we tested it against the standard lab test in 170 patients.This required significant regulatory oversight and planning. We showed that Samba II produced results in two hours and was highly accurate compared to the standard lab test, and within three weeks Addenbrooke’s hospital in Cambridgeshire adopted it. And within two weeks of the end of the study, the results of the lab validation and clinical evaluation studies were put online as a pre-print publication for scrutiny.The number of new Covid-19 cases across the UK is now relatively low, so obtaining appreciable numbers of positive Covid-19 patients is more difficult for validating new tests. An alternative option would be to validate tests in countries experiencing high infection rates, though this would be time-consuming and complex.Public funds have been used to purchase these tests, so transparency about their effectiveness is really important. Recent experience where the government purchased millions of sub-optimal antibody tests before they had been robustly evaluated shows the danger of purchasing equipment on the basis of manufacturers’ claims alone.We may be entering an era of trade-offs, where the accuracy of tests is balanced against the number of tests we can achieve. Many see more testing, done in a decentralised fashion, closer to communities and targeting specific at-risks groups, as the best route out of the Covid-19 crisis. In hospitals and care homes, where a single infection can lead to severe consequences in vulnerable people, we need highly accurate tests. In the community, where largely well people need to be tested repeatedly, a compromise between the accuracy, scale and cost of tests can perhaps be reached.• Ravindra Gupta is professor of clinical microbiology and honorary consultant physician at Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Cambridge.

On 5 August 2019, a year ago today, 7 million people were locked into their homes under a strict military curfew. Up to 10,000 people, from young children and teenage stone pelters to former chief ministers and major pro-India politicians, were arrested and put into preventive detention, where many of them still remain. On 6 August, a bill was passed in parliament stripping the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and special status enshrined in the Indian constitution. It was stripped of statehood, downgraded into two union territories, Ladakh, and Jammu and Kashmir. Ladakh would have no legislature and would be governed directly by New Delhi.The problem of Kashmir, we were told, had been finally solved once and for all. In other words, Kashmir’s decades-long struggle for self-determination, which has cost tens of thousands of lives of soldiers, militants and civilians, thousands of enforced “disappearances” and cruelly tortured bodies – was over.In India’s parliament, home minister Amit Shah went further. He said he was prepared to lay down his life to take over the territories of what India calls Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) and what Kashmiris call Azad Kashmir, as well as the frontier provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan. He also threw in Aksai Chin, once part of the erstwhile kingdom of Jammu and Kashmir, now a part of China. He was wading into dangerous territory, literally as well as figuratively. The borders he was talking about lie between three nuclear powers. Amid the unseemly celebrations on India’s streets, the extra wattage generated by Kashmir’s humiliation intensified the glow of prime minister Narendra Modi’s already god-like halo. Provocatively, the Indian meteorological department began to include Gilgit-Baltistan in its weather reports. Few of us in India paid attention to the Chinese government when it urged India to “be cautious in its words and deeds on the border issue”.In the year that has gone by, the struggle in Kashmir has by no means ended. In just the past few months media reports say that 34 soldiers, 154 militants and 17 civilians have been killed. A world traumatised by coronavirus has understandably paid no attention to what the Indian government has done to the people of Kashmir. The curfew and communication siege, and everything else that such a siege entails (no access to doctors, hospitals, work, no business, no school, no contact with loved ones), lasted for months. Even the US didn’t do this during its war against Iraq.Just a few months of Covid lockdown, without a military curfew or communications siege, has brought the world to its knees and hundreds of millions to the limits of their endurance and sanity. Think of Kashmir under the densest military deployment in the world. On top of the suffering coronavirus has laid on you, add a maze of barbed wire on your streets, soldiers breaking into your homes, beating the men and abusing the women, destroying your food stocks, amplifying the cries of humans being tortured on public address systems.Add to this a judicial system – including the supreme court of India – that has for a whole year allowed the internet siege to continue and ignored the 600 habeas corpus petitions by distraught people seeking the whereabouts of their family members. Add further a new domicile law that opens the floodgates by allowing Indians a right of residence in Kashmir. The precious state subject certificates of Kashmiris are now legally void except as backup evidence to bolster their applications to the Indian government for domicile status in their own homeland. Those whose applications are rejected can be denied residency and shipped out. What Kashmir faces is nothing less than cultural erasure.Kashmir’s new domicile law is a relative of India’s new blatantly anti-Muslim Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed in December 2019 and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that is supposed to detect “Bangladeshi infiltrators” (Muslim of course) whom the home minister has called “termites”. In the state of Assam, the NRC has already wreaked havoc. Millions have been struck off the citizens register. While many countries are dealing with a refugee crisis, the Indian government is turning citizens into refugees, fuelling a crisis of statelessness on an unimaginable scale.The CAA, NRC and Kashmir’s new domicile law require even bona fide citizens to produce a set of documents approved by the state in order to be granted citizenship. (The Nuremberg laws passed by the Nazi party in 1935 decreed that only those citizens who could provide legacy papers approved by the Third Reich were eligible for German citizenship.)What should all this be called? A war crime? Or a crime against humanity?And what should the collusion of institutions and the celebrations on the streets of India be called? Democracy?A year down the line, these celebrations over Kashmir are distinctly muted. For good reason. We have a dragon on our doorstep and it isn’t happy. On 17 June 2020, we awoke to the horrifying news that 20 Indian soldiers including a colonel had been brutally killed by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in the icy reaches of the remote Galwan Valley on the Ladakh border. Over the next few days reports in sections of the Indian press suggested that there had been several points of ingress. Army veterans and respected defence correspondents have said that the PLA has occupied hundreds of square kilometres of what India considers to be its territory. Was it just naked aggression as portrayed by the Indian media? Or have the Chinese moved to protect what they see as their vital interests – a road through the high mountains of Aksai Chin and a trade route through Pakistan OccupiedAzad Kashmir? Both are under threat, if the belligerent statements made by India’s home minister were to be taken seriously, and how can they not be?For a ferociously nationalist government such as ours to concede what it thinks of as sovereign territory has to be its worst nightmare. It cannot be countenanced. But what can be done? A simple solution was found. Just days after the Galwan Valley tragedy, Modi addressed the nation. “Not an inch of land has been occupied by anyone,” he said, “no one has entered our borders” and “none of our posts have been occupied by anyone”. Modi’s critics fell about laughing. The Chinese government was quick to welcome his statement, because that’s what they were saying, too. But Modi’s statement isn’t as stupid as it sounds. While army commanders of both countries are discussing withdrawal and the “disengagement” of troops and the social media is full of jokes about the art of exiting without entering, and while the Chinese continue to hold territory they claim to be their own, to the vast, uniformed majority of India’s population, Modi has won. It was on TV. And who’s to say which is more important? TV or territory?Whichever way you slice it, in the long-term, India now requires a battle-ready army on two fronts – the western frontier with Pakistan and the eastern frontier with China. In addition, the government’s hubris has alienated its neighbours Nepal and Bangladesh. We have been reduced to boasting that in the event of war, the US – reeling from its own crises – will come to India’s rescue. Really? Like it rescued the Kurds in Syria and Iraq? Like it rescued the Afghans from the Soviets? Or the South Vietnamese from the North Vietnamese?Last night a Kashmiri friend messaged me: “Will India, Pakistan and China fight over our skies without seeing us?” It’s not an unlikely scenario. None of these countries is morally superior or more humane than the other. None of them is in this for the greater good of humanity.Narendra Modi, India\u0027s Prime Minister since 2014, has triggered several major controversies in 2019.Modi authorises limited airstrikes across the “line of control” in Kashmir. He acted after the Valentine’s Day massacre by Islamist terrorists based in Azad Kashmir that killed 44 Indian paramilitaries. The attack was celebrated in India, but it was unclear whether anything significant had been struck by the fighter jets. Pakistan said the war planes made it up to five miles inside its territory before they were rebuffed, dropping their payloads without casualties or damage.Modi\u0027s party shocked the political establishment by nominating Pragya Singh Thakur, a Hindu nun accused of involvement in a terrorist attack targeting Muslims, for a seat in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Thakur handily won the seat in the May elections and was appointed to a parliamentary committee on defence - from which she was sacked eight days later for describing Gandhi\u0027s assassin as a patriot.Modi is sworn in as prime minister for the second time after his Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 seats, further increasing their substantial majority.Modi\u0027s government pass the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act which confirmed the Superem Court of India\u0027s 2017 ruling that the triple talaq, which enables men to instantly orce their wives, is unconstitutional.Delhi formally revokes the constitutional autonomy of Kashmir in an attempt to integrate it fully into India. The state was formally taken under direct federal control and split into the territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, bringing an end to decades of semi-autonomous rule. The decision to tighten the government’s grip over the region stoked anger and resentment.Modi\u0027s right-hand man, home minister Amit Shah, tells parliament he will seek to have every Indian prove their citizenship in order to root out illegal migrants. The citizenship checks are modelled on a process that took place this year in Assam state which has left 2m people in legal limbo and was criticised by the UN as an enormous blow to global efforts to eradicate statelessness.A new citizenship bill provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities who have immigrated into India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan before 31 December 2014. It explicitly lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as being able to take advantage of the new provisions, excluding Muslims. Street protests begin as a result.The first week of August comes with some other milestones, too. Despite the ill-planned, draconian, back-breaking lockdown, despite woefully few tests compared with other countries, confirmed cases of coronavirus in India are now growing at perhaps the fastest rate in the world. Among its victims is our sabre-rattling home minister, who is spending the anniversary in a hospital bed. Not for him the cures being peddled by the quacks, godmen and members of parliament in his party – drinking cow urine, a magic potion called Coronil, blowing conch shells and banging pots and pans, reciting the Hanuman Chalisa, chanting “Go, Corona, Go!” in the flat intonations of a Sanskrit sloka. Oh no. For him the most expensive private hospital and the best (allopathic) government doctors on call.And where will India’s prime minister be?If Kashmir had really been “solved” once and for all, he would be there to be feted by adoring socially distanced crowds. But Kashmir isn’t solved. It’s shut down again. And Ladakh is almost a battlefront. So, Modi has wisely decided to retreat from those troubled borders to a very safe place to make good another long-standing election promise. By the time you read this, he will, accompanied by prayers from priests and people across the country, as well as the blessings of India’s supreme court, have laid a silver slab that weighs 40kg as the foundation for the Ram Mandir, a temple that will rise from the ruins of the Babri Masjid, a mosque that was hammered into the dust by Hindu vigilantes led by members of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party in 1992. It’s been a long journey. Let’s call it a Triumph of the Will.Lockdown or no lockdown, as I write, I can sense the very air trembling in anticipation of the historic moment. Only the naive or the hopelessly indoctrinated can still believe that hunger and joblessness will lead to revolution – that temples and monuments cannot feed people. They can. The Ram Mandir is food for millions of starved Hindu souls. The further humiliation of the already humiliated Muslims and other minorities only sharpens the taste of victory on the tongue. How can bread compete?Perhaps, as the Chinese suggest, in this matter we should proceed with caution. Think a little. Why did Modi decide to inaugurate the Ram Mandir now? After all it’s not the festivals of Dussehra or Diwali, and the date has no particular relevance in the Ramayana or the Hindu calendar. And there’s a partial lockdown in most parts of India – many of the priests and policemen preparing and securing the site have already tested positive for Covid. So why now? Is it to rub salt into Kashmir’s wounds, or is it to put balm on India’s? Because, whatever they tell us on TV, there’s been a tectonic shift on the borders. Big plates are moving. The world order is changing. You can’t bully people and act like the top dog in the neighbourhood when you’re not top dog. That’s not a Chinese saying. It’s just common sense.Could it be that this August anniversary is not actually what it’s being cracked up to be? Could it be instead the little limpet of shame clamped to the soaring cliff of glory?When and if India, China and Pakistan fight over Kashmir’s skies, the least the rest of us can do is to keep our eyes on its people.• Arundhati Roy is a novelist, writer and political activist.

We were in a strip of forest, along a single-track road, making our way towards a huge industrial farm. It was overcast and the high trees made the day even more gloomy.We had been hired to investigate conditions on farms supplying UK supermarkets for a TV programme and not-for-profit campaign, and that was how we found ourselves at this giant pig farm in Poland. The arrival of foreign meat companies in the country was proving controversial. Local people were worried about the environmental consequences – as well as impacts on smaller-scale farmers – of having a multinational meat firm pitch up on their doorstep. We had arrived the day before, sleeping very little before driving for hours into the countryside. I was twitchy, a little nervous, head aching from a night on a lumpy, unfamiliar mattress. We knew the farm was around here somewhere, but weren’t sure which direction to take. And then ahead of us, through the trees, we spotted the lake. At the same time the smell reached us: an appalling stench, one of the worst smells I have ever encountered in my life.This was no lake. It was an open cesspit, a vast lagoon full of waste from the pig farm. Floating beneath the surface were the bodies of pigs in various stages of decomposition. Through the filth we could see snouts and curly tails.Everywhere was the detritus of factory farming – plastic syringe casings, needles and white clinical gloves – floating in the rancid pool and discarded on adjacent farmland. It was the first time I’d ever stepped on to a factory farm. It was a moment I would never be able to forget.I grew up mainly in towns and cities. My experience of farming was limited to those compulsory-but-dull school or Scouts visits to the local dairy, or the livestock you might come across during family days out in the countryside.In the early 1990s, I remember seeing television reports about the BSE scandal and hearing talk about the perils of eating beef. But I was a teenager. I had more important things to worry about. But in 2001, the foot and mouth disaster unfolded across the UK, with its burning cattle pyres and “no entry” signs erected across the countryside. This time I paid attention. The whole episode – devastated farmers, a rural economy in tatters, millions of farm animals culled, political wrangling and endless debates about who or what was to blame – highlighted somehow that something had gone wrong with the way we were farming and producing food.I went into journalism, working freelance for magazines and newspapers. In late 2003 I co-founded a media outfit – part production company, part detective agency – to carry out investigations into environmental and human rights issues, as well as animal welfare. We wanted to use the tactics of the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), who’d pioneered using dummy companies, hidden cameras and undercover agents to expose the ivory trade and illegal logging, to work as journalists and also for not-for-profit groups. Business was brisk. Demand for our work was high, and in 2005 we were commissioned to go to Poland.Although we were increasingly aware of the way our food was being produced thanks to the work of journalists such as Felicity Lawrence and Joanna Blythman, for me, as for most people, modern farming remained remote abstraction.But now, here in Poland, I was seeing the reality. In one vast, windowless warehouse, hundreds of young pigs were visible under the artificial lights: moving, squealing, eating, shitting. The unmistakable waft of animal waste and chemicals. Lame and injured pigs – one had an abnormal growth the size of a grapefruit, some looked emaciated, others appeared sick – and dead animals left abandoned on the ground, live pigs rustling around the carcasses. On the wall, charts recording the animals that had died – so-called mortality records – and medication sheets detailing the antibiotics that could be used.Afterwards, the smell stayed with us – on our clothes, our skin, our hair – seemingly for days.Why was our food being produced like this? It was shocking and I wanted to know more.I have now spent the best part of a decade and a half reporting on almost every aspect of the global meat industry. It is a journey that has taken me to farms of all types and sizes, from family smallholdings to vast concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), and into abattoirs, livestock markets, ports and food factories in numerous countries.There is a widespread culture of secrecy and a lack of accountability in the global meat industry, which is dominated by a handful of powerful yet little known corporations. Shining a light on “big ag’s” murkier corners therefore requires months of research, the sourcing of often suppressed data and documents, working with whistleblowers, and undercover investigations.In reality, quite often it’s about seizing the moment. Quickly pointing the camera through an open window or barn door or locked gate, or under a wire fence. You film what you find, first a scene-setting shot, to give a sense of scale and context, then close-ups to bring details to life.Sometimes, if you are following up a tipoff about a particularly problematic farm, what you see might be distressing – a pile of dead and dying chickens a spent dairy cow, sprawled out on the floor taking its last gasps an injured sheep, still alive, maggots in its wounds – accompanied by a backdrop of ear-deafening squeals or incessant grunts from confined livestock or the nauseating smell of waste as you try to focus.It always feels like you’ve stayed too long, even if it has only been seconds. You worry you haven’t got enough pictures – farms are inevitably dark and not conducive to cinematic beauty – and you pray the camera has done its job.Often, there’s simply too much happening to know where to point the camera, such as when a shedload of chickens are being rounded up for slaughter, workers swarming around you in near-darkness.Some of the farmers I’ve visited over the years are happy to have us they’ve nothing to hide and welcome the opportunity to talk about the challenges of making ends meet. Sometimes – particularly in the case of large corporate-owned farms or slaughterhouses – open filming isn’t an option. You have to rely on undercover reporting and hidden cameras.In the old days you could do it and worry about the details later, as long as you used common sense, adhered to biosecurity and basic health and safety rules. Now, any covert reporting has to be cleared in advance by editors and lawyers and requires lots of form filling, to make sure there’s public interest and justification. That’s as it should be, but it certainly makes things more complicated.As a journalist, it’s my job to go and see for myself the worst conditions that I hear about. In Italy, on farms supplying “artisanal” parma ham, I saw pigs held in battery conditions, with animals confined in metal cages – gestation crates, or sow stalls – designed for those that have been recently inseminated. They had no room to turn around: the cages weren’t much wider than the pigs themselves.In Portugal, I saw pigs being repeatedly hit and dragged by the ears, squealing, on to transporters before starting their journey to slaughter. In Spain, thousands of quails – reared for their eggs – were crammed into filthy battery cages, many having lost feathers and others dead and left to rot. Calves, too – some subject to journeys on trucks that take days – confined in solitary pens as part of the veal trade.In Bulgaria, I visited primitive horse and donkey farms, including one where animals were fixed to the wall or floor with rope and chains. Some had little, if any, straw or other bedding. At one farm, the corpse of a horse lay sprawled outside, blood visible on the ground. Similarly, in Croatia, I saw cattle tethered day and night in darkened sheds, some never having set foot on grass.In Chile, I saw vast offshore “floating feedlots” with thousands of salmon packed into underwater cages. In the UK – at one of the country’s biggest intensive beef farms – we saw cows caked in excrement and other waste in flooded, dirty yards with no protection from the elements.And in poultry units across Europe, time and again I’ve seen broiler chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese crammed into vast, crowded sheds with no outside access. Each morning on these farms, workers remove the birds that have died overnight. Sometimes a handful, sometimes scores of birds, flung into piles on the floor or loaded on to wheelbarrows, and chicks disposed of – some still alive – into skips piled high with carcasses.These scenes illustrate the virtual worthlessness of inidual birds. On some farms, hundreds of birds can die each week – in the UK, more than a million chickens die before reaching the slaughterhouse each year.The chain doesn’t end on farms. Animals have to be processed into meat, and slaughterhouses have faced repeated allegations of cruelty, despite supposedly stringent oversight in many countries.I’ve been inside poultry and rabbit abattoirs. I worked undercover in Portugal, capturing footage at a slaughterhouse specialising in suckling pigs, usually roasted whole as a popular treat. The graphic scenes we filmed caused uproar in a country where few people had seen how their meat was being produced.After being unloaded, the pigs were taken to a stun room containing a series of small holding pens where a worker, using what looked like a large pair of tongs, stood among the squealing animals and calmly applied a shock to each one’s head before shackling the bodies on to the moving production line which carried them up through a hatch in the wall.Some twitched involuntarily after being attached to the moving rail, others appeared to be fully conscious as they moved along the line, eyes open and kicking, into the kill room. Here, a worker plunged a large knife into each pig’s neck, causing a gush of blood to shoot down into a tray below, and holding each pig by the legs as they began to “bleed out”.The slaughterman offered me the knife in case I wanted a go. I declined.Where cameras can’t go, you have to rely on other evidence. Unpublished reports by UK vets and hygiene inspectors that I obtained detailed thousands of – apparently industrywide – breaches of welfare regulations, including instances of chickens and pigs being boiled alive after being immersed into tanks of scalding hot water, used to soften the skin and remove hair or feathers.The smell and sounds and frenetic activity of an abattoir don’t leave you. The whirring of machinery, the clinking of chains, the animal cries, the shouts of workers, the steam, the blood and offal carcasses swinging on the line. The animals may be stressed, but you wonder also what impact this has on the workers who do this, day in, day out.The effects of these industrial systems are not just felt in the farmyards or the slaughterhouses. I have seen the wider impact of the quest for food miles away from the farms. Animals that once lived off the land, or off waste, are now given bags of expensive industrially produced feed the need to fatten them as quickly as possible demands huge inputs of protein, and that protein is pulled from all over the world.Soy is one source. I’ve reported on the well-known problems with deforestation but I’ve alsowritten about some of the chilling human rights abuses connected to the industry in Paraguay, where much soy was destined for factory farms in China and Europe. Peasant and indigenous organisations had been protesting against the encroachment of the soy farms on their land. The response from some of the soy farmers – with the backing of police and paramilitary units – was brutal: violent evictions, shootings and beatings, resulting in numerous injuries and several deaths, as well as arbitrary detentions and disappearances.Fishmeal is another source of protein with its own impact, as I saw in Peru. Yards away from the bustling port of Chimbote, lying on the rubbish-strewn beach, were the carcasses of about six sea lions, quietly rotting in the sunshine. Their normally grey silky skin had turned a rusty, orange hue. One carcass, its eyes long since gone and tongue spilling out from its swollen body, was swarming with flies.The sea lions had been slaughtered by local fishermen, who saw them as competitors for dwindling fish resources in this part of the Pacific. Demand for anchovy – hoovered up for use in fishmeal and fish oil – had impacted on the sea’s natural food chain, and reduced stocks of previously plentiful species fished for human consumption.Forty fishmeal factories were processing anchovies caught by the city’s fleet, and the area had become a major flashpoint for conflict. (New fishmeal frontiers in west Africa and Asia have joined the party, bringing fresh problems.)I visited one poor community where more than a dozen women and children gathered in the dusty, unpaved street to vent their anger at pollution from the fishmeal plants: they claimed they were responsible for asthma, bronchial and skin problems, particularly in children.Footage filmed by residents showed conditions when plants were operational: billowing black smoke drifted through the streets, obscuring vision and choking passersby. It looked like the aftermath of a bomb.According to environmentalists, the sea in Ferrol Bay off Chimbote was now becoming a “dead zone”, largely due to contamination from the fishmeal industry. The plants were accused of discharging protein, fat and oil into the bay, as well as contaminated marine water used during the process of pumping fish from the ship’s hull to the processing plant.I remember looking at the ocean stretching out in front of us, and feeling anger and bewilderment that it was being choked of life – quite literally – largely to feed livestock confined in far-off farms.So how did we end up with this system? Industry chiefs I’ve interviewed argue that factory farms exist because of the demand for cheap meat, and that producing enough of it efficiently to meet that demand is possible only by using intensive systems.They point out that supermarkets – arguably the biggest champions of cheap food – require reliable and consistent supplies that meet exact specifications, all year round. Sourcing on such a scale simply wouldn’t be viable if they bought only from the smaller, independent family-owned farms run in the traditional ways.And despite the furore around the spread of megafarms, size isn’t an indicator of the welfare standards they maintain in fact larger, more modern units are often superior, with hi-tech systems and good veterinary care.Despite what I’ve seen, experience tells me that the majority of livestock farmers are decent, hardworking folk who do their best to make a living in an industry where money doesn’t readily flow down to the small guys, and where margins are often so slim that any unforeseen event can prove catastrophic.I have spoken to dairy farmers who are trying desperately to keep their businesses afloat but acknowledge that, at some point, their farms will have to close, despite in some cases being in the same family for generations. I’ve spoken to beef farmers – some of whom quietly expressed criticism of the intensive feedlot-style cattle farms popping up across the UK – that have dedicated themselves to offering higher welfare, grass-fed beef sold directly to the public as an alternative to cheap supermarket products.Many of these farmers are as much victims of the system as their livestock.In the age of hyper-cheap food you can pick up a whole chicken for a few pounds, and a pint of milk for less than a bottle of water. Yet these prices fail to reflect the true cost of production. The terms dictated by supermarkets and processing companies put too many farmers in the grotesque position of losing money on the foodstuffs they’ve spent weeks, months or years producing.It’s the sheer scale of production, driven by insatiable demand, that is the problem, fuelling bigger farms and more intensive systems – the more animals you can squeeze in, the more food you can produce, the more money there is to be made.Megafarms that house thousands of pigs, poultry, beef and dairy cattle are now common. But when things go wrong – fires, floods, disease outbreaks, equipment breakdowns, pollution – the bigger the farm, the bigger the consequences.Coupled with vertically integrated supply chains and controversial contract farming models – which, critics say, outsource many of the financial risks to farmers – this has unavoidably created a system which has turned farm animals into mere commodities. “Meat machines”, as one campaigner put it.The language used in the poultry industry illustrates the point: industrially produced chickens are no longer referred to as birds but as “crops”, in the same way as you might refer to a field of lettuces or tomatoes. Chicken producers can be referred to as “growers”, not farmers, and it comes as no surprise that they are not paid for inidual birds, but for the weight each “crop” of chickens achieves.As one UK farmer told me, modern chicken sheds are simply “petri dishes of live protein-on-legs”.About 70 billion land animals are produced globally for food each year, an estimated two-thirds reared in intensive conditions. Many of the issues this raises, and which I’ve covered extensively – food safety, antibiotic resistance, animal welfare, exploitation of workers, pollution, deforestation – are now firmly on the global agenda and commanding attention.The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted renewed calls for change: in the US, some politicians are calling for the biggest factory farms to be phased out by 2040. Even the UN is urging a rethink of industrial farming, citing links with zoonotic infections and the widespread use of arable land for animal feed, driving deforestation.Addressing the question of how the world produces enough meat, safely and sustainably (and humanely), to feed a growing population while safeguarding the environment, is more relevant – and more complicated – than ever.I’ll leave it to scientists and others more qualified than me to answer this question. But, thinking back to that squalid farm in Poland, and everything I’ve seen since, I can safely say one thing: we shouldn’t do it like this.This is an edited extract from a longer version of this article, which can be found on Medium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936c0b105d58b82b2a988d0eba4748aafbe7bbbc/0_170_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12fa8ce003a759fdbd7f9b583913858b","title":"tesco urged to ditch meat company over alleged links to amazon deforestation","story":"Responding to Greenpeace campaign to cut links to Brazilian meat giant JBS, supermarket calls on government to ensure all UK food is deforestation-freeTesco has called on the UK government to order food companies to ensure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free. The move comes in response to a new Greenpeace campaign calling on the supermarket to cut links to JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, over its alleged links to farms involved in Amazon deforestation.The supermarket says the UK should introduce due diligence across supply chains to monitor for deforestation. Germany is also weighing up a due diligence law on supply chains, reportedly supported by Angela Merkel. And more than half of Britons would consider rejecting meat products linked to deforestation, a YouGov poll for Greenpeace has found.“Today we call for our government to mandate food companies, as part of its National Food Strategy, to introduce effective due diligence across supply chains to make sure all food sold in the UK is deforestation-free,” said the Tesco group chief executive, Dave Lewis, in a statement. “We are making tangible progress but we can’t solve this on our own.”But Tesco said that while it has blocked Brazilian meat sales since 2018, it will not delist two JBS-owned meat suppliers. JBS said it was committed to ending deforestation throughout its supply chain.“Cattle ranching is the biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon,” said Anna Jones, Greenpeace UK’s head of forests, describing the world’s biggest rainforest as “a big beating ecosystem that helps to regulate the climate and plays a role in climate stability.”JBS has been linked to farms involved in Amazon deforestation five times in just over a year. Investor Nordea Asset Management has dropped the company from its portfolio.In 2009, following a Greenpeace report exposing the role of Brazilian meat companies in Amazon deforestation, JBS and other Brazilian meat companies committed to controlling their “indirect suppliers” by 2011. Greenpeace said JBS is “still slaughtering the Amazon” in a new report also released on Wednesday. “JBS continues to have a problem,” said Jones. “It does not have full transparency.”“Setting fires to clear land for crops or grazing is destroying precious habitats like the Brazilian rainforest. It must stop. That’s why we support Greenpeace’s aim to prevent further Amazon deforestation,” a spokesperson for Tesco said.But delisting Moy Park and Tulip – which also supply Aldi, Co-op, Lidl, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose – “could lead to thousands of job losses, impact British farmers and ultimately compromise our ability to offer fresh British meat and chicken to our customers,” Tesco said. “We recognise that the UK as a whole needs to reduce meat and dairy consumption.”In Brazil, an expensive army operation to combat fires and deforestation has been widely criticised as ineffective by local media, and the government has been reluctant to admit it has a deforestation problem.“Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that is able to produce and preserve,” agriculture minister Tereza Cristina Dias said in a video speech to the Brazilian Agrobusiness Association on Monday. “We have improved our livestock farming, reducing the use of land and increasing productivity.”In response to Greenpeace’s claims that the company is indirectly sourcing cattle from farms in the Amazon involved in deforestation, a spokesperson said: “All JBS subsidiary companies adhere to strict responsible procurement policies throughout their supply chains and share our dedication to eliminating deforestation for good.”“We have been at the forefront of the industry in taking steps to improve supply chain traceability in Brazil. We are working closely with national and local government departments to develop solutions and system improvements around supply chain traceability and best agricultural practice to eradicate deforestation.“JBS will continue to evolve continuously in new initiatives and plans in the coming months to promote significant changes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c82ae1bf918e26aa4661c303ed8909fb2269205/0_1311_2161_1296/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c76670cce683ea2fbbfcfdc58e9a5d4","title":"throng of new penguin colonies in antarctica spotted from space","story":"The discoveries were made by spotting the distinctive red-brown guano patches the birds leave on the ice.

All the new colonies are in areas that are at risk and researchers say these will be the “canaries in the coal mine” as global heating increasingly affects Antarctica.Philip Trathan, also at BAS, said: “The new breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperor penguins will decline. These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coalmine – we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.”Fretwell said one of the colonies was 112 miles (180km) from the Antarctic continent: “Many of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.” Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully.There were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50C in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 metres, which is enough to spot the larger colonies.The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 metres. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation.Emperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. “In every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,” said Fretwell.Three of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or aeroplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. “There may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,” said Fretwell.The next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30cm-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. “It is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can’t count them yet,” said Fretwell. “The sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.”• This article was amended on 5 August 2020.

But the scenery is greatNorwegian filmmaker André Øvredal turned Hollywood heads in 2011 with his local folkloric fantasy Troll Hunter. So it must irk him that the definitive movie franchise about the Old Norse gods has been made by Americans, with an Australian for its star. Reclaiming Thor from the cultural appropriators may be a noble cause, but that’s no guarantee of victory.In the mountains of Norway’s picturesque Odda region, a mysteriously powerful traveller named Eric (Nat Wolff) has been hiding out since his suspected involvement in a fatal arson attack three years ago. He emerges to forage for supplies in town and, after accidentally-on-purpose killing a local teen bully, he’s arrested by police chief Henrik (Per Frisch), an officer far too kindly and sober to ever make it in the mean streets of Nordic noir.Henrik calls in young psychologist Christina (Iben Akerlie) to evaluate the stranger and, as a highly predictable romance develops, she intuits that Eric’s electromagnetic outbursts are rooted in his psychic turmoil. Only when he understands the latter will he be able to master the former – the usual adolescent X-Men neuroses, then. Christina slots in as the all-forgiving woman of bottomless compassion who dedicates herself to helping Eric hold it in and, when he doesn’t quite manage – which is often – cleaning up his mess afterwards.The modest visual effects, which mostly consist of distant lighting bolts and gathering storm clouds, can do little to elevate this potty-training-for-the-patriarchy narrative. Until Thor’s hammer turns up, it’s basically the Weather Channel. All of which goes to show that subtitles and scenery can’t make a formulaic superhero movie any more interesting. The natural wonders of the Odda Valley are just no match for the computer-generated wonders of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.• Mortal is available on digital platforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d58ff546ddbb9a44d54d5f39ce74a83fde3806/879_1378_5316_3188/master/5316.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8fd8f3bee59df2c5777d1e285d698290","title":"footballers who have had club shirts retired having played very few games","story":"Plus: the longest unbeaten home runs, most draws in a promotion season and Ken Dodd’s Glasgow Empire quip“Birmingham took the unusual step of retiring Jude Bellingham’s No 22 shirt after the teenage prodigy secured a move to Borussia Dortmund. What other clubs have retired shirt numbers in honour of players? And, if there are others, are Bellingham’s 44 appearances a record low for the bestowing of this honour?” asks Derek Robertson.We covered Derek’s first question back in 2009, with Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini and Bobby Moore among the legends whose shirt numbers were retired. There have been plenty of examples of a shirt number being retired in honour of a younger player – most, sadly, in more sombre circumstances than Jude Bellingham’s.“QPR retired the No 31 shirt in memory of Ray Jones,” writes Edar Mullan. “The promising young striker had scored six goals in 37 appearances for the Rs before he died in a car crash in 2007, three days short of his 19th birthday.The list of players whose shirt number was retired posthumously is tragically long. Those who made fewer than Bellingham’s 44 appearances include Marc-Vivien Foé (Manchester City, No 23, 38 appearances), Michael Maidens (Hartlepool, No 25, 31 apps), Mark Philo (Wycombe, No 14, 17 appearances), Cheick Tioté (Beijing Enterprises, No 24, 11 appearances) and Dylan Tombides (West Ham, No 38, one appearance).Of those whose shirt number was retired while they were still alive, one man stands out: Austrian journeyman and cult figure Stefan Maierhofer. “The tall striker is not the most gifted footballer, but is rather known for his work ethic and his incredible self-esteem,” says Michael Gahler. “In November 2014 he joined SC Wiener Neustadt on a short-term deal until the end of the season. He had the option to terminate the contract if a foreign club came in for him during the January transfer window, and he joined Millwall for a second time after less than two months with Weiner Neustadt.“He had worn No 39 while at the club (it wasn’t his regular shirt number – I guess he just took some random number that was not occupied since he joined in the middle of the season), and when he left the club decided to retire his shirt number. ‘As a motivator he influenced the team with his positive energy during a difficult spell, they explained, ‘and he helped SC Wiener Neustadt to gain previously unknown public perception.’“Sadly his time at the club didn’t help them avoid relegation from the Austrian Bundesliga. They haven’t returned to the top flight since.”“Liverpool have gone three straight league seasons without a home defeat. What’s the record (English, European, worldwide)?” wonders Boris Cule.As great as Liverpool have been at Anfield in the last few years, their unbeaten run of 59 league games and three full seasons barely registers on the fortressometer. According to the wonderful RSSSF site there are at least 19 clubs who have had longer unbeaten runs at home – including Liverpool themselves, from February 1978 to January 1981. That only took in two full seasons, but the run lasted 63 matches in total.The best of the Premier League era is Chelsea, who went 86 matches and four full seasons without defeat at Stamford Bridge from March 2004 to October 2008, when they were beaten 1-0 by, yep, Liverpool. But when it comes to fortresses, nothing compares to the Bernabéu in the late 1950s and early 1960s.Real Madrid were unbeaten in 121 league games – and seven full seasons – at home between February 1957, when they lost 2-0 at home to Atlético Madrid, and March 1965. The run ended in painful circumstances for Madrid when when Jorge Mendonça (no relation) scored the only goal to give Atléti a famous victory.“West Brom drew 17 Championship games last season – is that a record for a promoted side?” asks Karin Sundmark.That’s an excellent spot, Karin, but it’s not quite a record. Our first thought was Italy in the days when backpasses were still allowed, and Serie B didn’t disappoint. In 1991-92, the last season before the introduction of the backpass law, both Brescia and Ancona were promoted after drawing 21 of their 34 league games. Ancona’s away record was particularly special: 19 games, one win, 15 draws (F-I-F-T-E-E-N), nine of them goalless. And to think some people thought the backpass law was a bad idea.Pisa did even better in 1981-82, drawing 23 of their 38 games on their way to promotion to Serie A. And spare a thought for Perugia. We all know about the 1978-79 season, when they were unbeaten in Serie A and still didn’t win the league. Six years later they lost only one of their 38 Serie B games in and still finished two points off promotion. If only they had been able to turn a couple of their TWENTY-BLOODY-SIX draws into victories.“Ken Dodd and other comedians of his era were fond of belittling their modern counterparts by saying that if they want to be compared with the old guys, they should try playing the Glasgow Empire on a wet winter Monday after Rangers and Celtic both lost at home on the Saturday,” explained in November 2003 Tom Paternoster. “Given that these two only seem to lose two games a season, has this scenario ever actually happened?”It’s highly unlikely, Tom. Because not only do Rangers and Celtic rarely lose on the same day, they also aren’t allowed to play at home on the same day – though on 19 April 1972, Ibrox was full for a Cup Winners’ Cup game against Bayern Munich just as Parkhead was for a European Cup game against Inter, which is to say that roughly 18 percent of Glasgow’s population went to the game that night. But, home or away, the Old Firm are not invincible and sometimes, they have to lose. And we’re still betting that if Ken Dodd had played the Empire on Thursday 23rd August 2001, the day after Rangers and Celtic were beaten in the European Cup by Fenerbahce and Ajax respectively, the gig would have gone down about as well as Peter Ridsdale wandering into a Leeds tavern on a Saturday night.“Leon Balogun finished his 2019-20 season with Wigan at around 9.30pm on 22 July and started his 2020-21 season with Rangers at 12.30pm on Saturday 1 August. Has there ever been a shorter gap between a player’s domestic seasons?” asks Mike Peter.“Way back when, it was common for teams to be managed ‘by committee’ rather than an inidual manager. Which was the last team in the Football League to switch to the modern system?” asks James Murton.“I ended up on the Ukrainian Premier League Wikipedia page and noticed that recurring champions Shakhtar Donetsk went top of the table way back in Gameweek 1 on the 31 July 2019 with a 3-1 win away to Oleksandriya and never dropped off the top spot all the way to the end of the season. Has this occurred in many other leagues? (I have an inkling PSG or Bayern may have done it in recent years)” – Dean Whearty.“Martin Kamburov was recently crowned top scorer in the Bulgarian top-flight for the sixth time.

So many, in fact, that it takes three video calls over two days (and a lot of patience on his part) to even scratch the surface. Over the last 30 years, he has been from the bottom of world football to the top and back again, stopping on every step in between and at quite a few places around the edges.There are tales from his playing days: memories of Carlo Ancelotti, Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram at Parma recollections of Roberto Mancini, Adriano and Luís Figo at Inter stories of Mário Zagallo, Ronaldo and Romário Romario with Brazil. Then there are the times spent as a manager in Kenya, in a remote Romanian ski resort and the Albanian second tier. There are thoughts on the current state of football and on the barriers he faces as a black coach trying to take his career to the next level.As our conversation jumps from country to country, subject to subject and through different eras, he goes back to the same themes of relationships, trust and the power of persuasion. More than once, he brings up his favourite quote from Bernardinho, a Brazilian volleyball coach so successful his house contains more precious metal than most central banks: “A great coach is one who can make a player willingly do that which he normally would not.”For Zé Maria, that coach was Ancelotti, who he calls his “biggest influence” and “one of the three best managers in the world”. Ancelotti was the promising young Parma boss when Zé Maria moved there from Flamengo in 1996. “I was approached by Barcelona and Real Madrid, but I turned them down,” he says. “My dream was to play at a big club in Italy. In Brazil, we only saw the Italian league.”It was not without its challenges. “Serie A is the most difficult league in the world. You leave Brazil, you have zero tactical knowledge and you go to a country where it’s all tactics? It’s complicated. As a full-back I liked to attack and attack. I had to learn how to defend, to cover the centre-backs.”Ancelotti led Parma to second place in Serie A that season after being in the relegation zone at Christmas and, Zé Maria says, the relationship they built – “a bond of friendship but always respecting the limits between manager and player” – survives now. He spent a week watching Ancelotti work at Napoli in 2019 and follows his progress at Everton.After finishing as a runner-up in 1997, Zé Maria had to wait nine years before he finally won a Scudetto while playing for Inter. In another stellar squad, with another young, ambitious Italian manager in the shape of Mancini, Inter also won the Coppa Italia twice in both of his two years in Milan.Just how good was Adriano? “I had to mark him when he was at Inter and I was at Perugia. I remember a game when our centre-back tried to haul him down by the neck and Adriano dragged the guy along for 10 metres, broke away and scored. He was intelligent too, so he was unmarkable. Unfortunately, when his father died, he had a lot of problems in his head. Even when you’re close friends, it’s difficult for you to hold back a guy who is 1.90m tall, weighs 90kg, who wants to go out and live his life. Unfortunately, he ended up losing a little of what he could have given.”In Brazil, the media coverage of Adriano’s personal life is intense and often sneering, even a decade after he last played for the national team. “There is a passage in the bible ‘A prophet is not without honour, except in his own land.’” Zé Maria says. “In their own country people are intensely criticised. Adriano’s problem, if it is a problem, is that he is a fantastic boy with a huge heart. People criticise him for that. People want him to be something else.”As well as that silverware in Italy, Zé Maria won a Confederations Cup and Copa América with Brazil in 1997, in a squad he describes as “one of the greatest in the history of the Seleção.” It is a bold claim, but one that bears up to scrutiny. Brazil played 24 times in 1997 and scored 71 goals – three per game. A front two of Ronaldo and Romário cut through defences like woodchipper through candy floss and they were more than ably supported.“Everyone had their own temperament, but there were never any clashes. Zagallo knew how to control it, giving a bit of freedom at the right time, controlling things at other times. Even with Romário, there are times that you can go out, and times you can’t. They ended up having a few arguments. But up until 1997, Romário was always in the squad. He only didn’t go to the World Cup because he was injured.”The same fate befell Zé Maria. He picked up a knee injury at the Gold Cup in February 1998 – not helped by the fact that Zagallo played him while unfit. There had been talk that he, not Cafu, would be the first-choice right back in France – “I was one of the few players who really pushed him for that position,” he says – but it was not to be.His teams? We’re off in another direction now. In 2010, Zé Maria completed his Uefa Pro Licence at Coverciano, the revered Italian managerial finishing school that trained his mentors Ancelotti and Mancini. “You study various subjects – English, sports medicine, physical training, technique and tactics – and two that really caught my attention: psychology and communication.”Kenya was a jarring contrast. “I arrived in Nairobi and, when I got off the plane, I almost caught fire. The sun burns on your skin. I walked down the road and there were zebras on the other side. I was having lunch next to Lake Victoria and a guy came over and said: ‘Careful if you see any waves here, because it might be a hippopotamus.’ People wondered what I was doing there. ‘Zé Maria who played for Brazil and Inter?’ They wanted to touch me. People wanted to hear my stories. It was the biggest club in Kenya, so every game was like managing Flamengo or Corinthians in Brazil. The stadium was packed.“There were difficulties. Sometimes you go to a stadium where the players don’t all fit in the changing room, so you have to change on the bus. But the passion is absurd. African players are technically similar to Brazilians, but they lack opportunities to move to bigger leagues. Because of the pitches, when you dribbled the ball would bounce a metre up in the air, but the quality with which they controlled and conducted it, not even a Brazilian would do that.“I’ve heard Muricy Ramalho, a great coach, saying: ‘I’m Brazilian, we have to dribble, we can’t lose that.’ But you’re not going to lose that. You can dribble, but with organisation behind it. Those are the things Brazilians don’t want to do, to get out of that comfort zone, to grow. That’s what we have to learn. The Argentinians do that. Pochettino, Simeone. It’s arrogant to think that you don’t need to improve.”His race also held him back as a player. “I was going to move to Verona but I didn’t go because the fans thought there should not be a black player in their team. I’ve been to cities where I was booed, along with other players of colour, like Thuram. When it happened, I responded by dedicating myself even more. That was my way of showing up their stupidity. They harmed their own clubs. They lost on the pitch and were fined off it. But in the following game the same thing happened again. That’s why I say it’s unlikely that it’ll change. It’s sad that people don’t learn.”“We need a 180-degree turn and that requires courage. It requires courage from club presidents and the people in charge. When a coach of colour takes over at a big club, he has to be the best, otherwise he will be fired quickly. We’re not asking for much. I just want the same amount of time a white manager would have. If the opportunity comes for me to coach a big club in Brazil or Europe, I am qualified to do it well.”“It would be easier for me in Italy, because of the language. But, thinking about how I want to work, with intensity from morning until evening, England is the place. I demanded a lot from myself as a player – I stayed after training to practice crossing, passing and shooting – and that’s what I demand from my players: dedication and desire to win.”• This is an article from Yellow \u0026amp Green Football• Follow them on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter• And follow Joshua Law on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc3e72a3e1d02ca7e4fe460f8e026487ecb388e/102_141_2763_1659/master/2763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fef88f8b69353d3c8d896ff5c7b40bb7","title":"joe bryan seizes the moment to grab glory and crush brentford spirit","story":"The pragmatism of Scott Parker’s Fulham triumphed over the doomed idealism of Thomas Frank’s Brentford in a game that failed to live up to the billingAnd so, ultimately, it all came down to this. A full year of toil 120 minutes of grim application, in many cases a lifetime of longing. A free-kick in a seemingly innocuous position on the left wing. A defence maintaining an audaciously high line, a goalkeeper anxiously patrolling the space behind it and a left-back who spied an irresistible opportunity to write himself into folklore.That, ultimately, was all it took to send Fulham back to the Premier League and leave Brentford in the Championship for another season. On one level, it felt unspeakably senseless for something this important to be settled by something this silly. But then again, here we all were, watching a terrible game at an empty Wembley Stadium in August, with fake crowd noise being piped over the airwaves and a socially-distanced national anthem at the start. Perhaps, on reflection, the ship had already sailed on that score.Joy unconfined for Fulham, of course, and perhaps a little salty defiance too, after being cast as the makeweights in this final. And yet, even if they were the more assured team on the night, right down to Joe Bryan’s premeditated slice of opportunism, you’d be hard pushed to describe them as deserving winners: a term which implies a semblance of logic, of rational process, above all of proportionality. And really, very little about this fixture has ever really been proportional, from its ridiculous importance to the way people talk about it.The Championship play-off final is often described – with football’s characteristic vulgarity – in terms of its pecuniary reward. “The richest game in football”. “The £170m game”. As if the money were in a glass box suspended above the pitch, like in a TV game show. As if, as the full-time whistle blew, the winners would be showered in a typhoon of flying banknotes and embraced by a beaming Davina McCall. As if the ultimate objective of football were three seasons of guaranteed parachute payments.It’s a cool story, but the real motif of this fixture is status. About where you are and where you need to be. As good as the Championship is as a competition, as a dream factory, as an entertainment product in its own right, it’s the pinnacle of nothing. Being in the Championship is a bit like being the leader of the opposition: if it’s all you’ve achieved, then on some elemental level you’ve fallen short of expectations.For young players like Josh Dasilva, released by Arsenal two years ago, it was about fulfilling the promise that first opened the doors to this world. For those like Bryan who have toppled from the pedestal, it’s about proving to the sport, but mostly to yourself, that you can still pass muster at the highest level. Nine of Fulham’s starting XI had previous Premier League experience. Brentford’s entire squad had a grand total of two appearances.And so perhaps a good way of thinking about this taut, undulating game was as pure hunger against pure desperation, the doomed idealism of Thomas Frank’s Brentford against the cussed and ultimately triumphant pragmatism of Scott Parker’s Fulham.Fulham may not have won too many points for artistic merit this season but here we discovered why. With Aleksandar Mitrovic unable to start because of a hamstring problem, they looked secure without ever looking like they knew how they were going to break Brentford down. The full-backs largely pulled their punches. The midfield sat tight and narrow, seeking to recycle possession rather than risk losing it. Centre-halves Tim Ream and Michael Hector exchanged more passes than anyone on the pitch. It was a bespoke system for a bespoke game.Brentford, on the other hand, have a philosophy. They have a “way”. They have combinations, overloads, transitions, a meticulously drilled attacking game that somehow still feels fresh and full of personality.They have a hip manager in Frank who whips out a miniature tactics board during the drinks breaks, which seems to disproportionately aggravate a certain kind of person, who will instantly start spuming at the mouth at the sheer metropolitan pretension of it all. I mean, what does he think this is, football? And yet, as Bryan finally buried Brentford’s hopes with his second goal deep into injury time, you could see the lack of comprehension on the faces of their players and staff. What good is a process in a game when only the result matters? What good is a philosophy in a sport where everything can turn on a freak goal from a set piece? How do you take pride in a season that has ended so crushingly?But then, this has always been the irresistible caprice of football, a low-scoring game that for all your plans and strategems can never entirely be bent to your will. Fulham’s triumph was to turn it into a battle of errors and inidual flourish. As the whistle blew, there was no glass box, no banknotes, no Davina McCall. Just a winner and a loser, and a pitiless line between them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/402a935d0a5341e7c25133c8d99c89baa688b865/186_72_3067_1842/master/3067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f0459ac0a79edd8ab80d401f79b0e0e","title":"restart football offers glimpse tv centred future","story":"Like it or not virtual silence, five substitutes and drinks breaks all make for a richer viewing experience from the sofa “Stay big, bring him inside, bring him inside” … “Lean into him, go on” … “Right foot, right foot” … “Good lad”. That is a truncated summary of the instructions passed between Ray Lewington and Tyrick Mitchell during Crystal Palace’s final match of the season, a 1-1 draw with Tottenham.Mitchell is a graduate of the Palace academy and the Spurs match was his fourth senior appearance. Lewington has been coaching for 34 years. Part of his job is to pass his expertise on to players, to help them learn. Thanks to the particular conditions imposed on the restart of football, however, Lewington was able to coach in a new way live, unrelenting, in Mitchell’s ear like a podcast that was impossible to switch off.Restart football has had its critics, and the reasons are understandable. There was a sense of ghoulishness about playing on in a pandemic, something reinforced by echoes bouncing around empty stadiums. It was only being done for money and it was achieved without supporters, who were contained within a video wall, released only when it was time to shake a fist or collapse their heads into their hands.There were good bits to restart football too, though. There were things that made it different and which offered fans, well viewers, the chance to experience something new. As the 2020-21 season approaches, with a push to get things back to normal, these innovations seem likely to disappear. That will be a shame.Mitchell had a stormer against Spurs, earning a post-match backslap from José Mourinho. Watching Lewington coach him through the game and seeing the youngster absorb information and respond was fascinating. In that same game, because Palace were pumped up to put an end to a seven-match losing streak and Spurs were on the verge of qualifying for Europe, there was also a cacophony of noise provided by the players as they sought to keep each other on their toes.That intensity would normally be provided by fans, of course, and the only reason you could hear what was said on the pitch was because fans were not there. So as a trade-off it was not ideal. But sitting in the ground reporting it provided an insight I do not normally get and, by switching off the fake crowd noise, the viewer could pick it up at home, too.Other changes were deliberate, rules devised to suit the particular nature of the restart. The use of five substitutes, from a bench of nine, is one. Designed to help prevent burnout during a compacted calendar, it has been the subject of much scrutiny and some thoughtful analysis. Does it benefit big clubs with deeper resources, or actually help smaller teams for whom the gap between a first XI and its reserves is less steep?Whatever the answer, as a viewer, five subs makes for a more interesting, intriguing experience. Quite simply it offers a greater number of variations in a game. Ole Gunnar Solskjær embraced the new rule by making changes the first coach in England to introduce five substitutes and, in extra time in the FA Cup at Norwich in June, the first to make six.Against Spurs in his first game back he used four subs to change the personnel and shape into something more attacking as United tried to come back from a goal down. Once Bruno Fernandes had scored the equalising penalty, the final change was used to hoik Scott McTominay out of a makeshift backline and replace him with an actual defender.Another change was the drinks break. Brought in to help players stay hydrated during summer matches, it looks likely to be given the chop for next season. It has again been criticised, both as an unnecessary interruption and an advertising break by stealth. It is inarguably a tactical break, something which some people do not like either. But watching the FA Cup final it was hard to argue that the story of the game was not improved by Mikel Arteta using a drinks break to counter Chelsea’s blitz of a start by telling Kieran Tierney to send the ball long, beyond the opponent’s high line, wherever possible.Just for the sake of balance, Frank Lampard used the break to good effect as he switched tactics in the second half against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge in June. By holding off a City onslaught and sneaking a win (again through a more direct approach against an advancing opponent), he earned points that effectively got his team into the Champions League. Another twist.Silence, subs, drinks breaks make for a richer viewing experience. And viewing is what restart football is about. You could not go to a game as a fan but, for a glorious six-week spell, it felt as if there was always a match lurking somewhere on your phone. For the next month there will be a similar, slightly thinner experience as Uefa plays out the remainder of its competitions in what BT Sport is ill-advisedly calling Club 2020.Restart football is only available through your TV but, by and large, it was not designed for it. As all the canvas seat covers around the grounds reminded us, it was trying to get as close to normal football as the circumstances allowed.

Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

More than 200 days since coronavirus was first detected, public health authorities say the number of infections is accelerating and the peak still lies ahead. In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.  international correspondent Michael Safi talks to Rachel Humphreys about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed a greater risk to life than coronavirus itself.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

He said: “Now our focus must turn to earning the trust of people looking for a positive and credible alternative for Scotland, and who want a fresh start for our country. I hope you’ll join us.”One of the few Scottish Tory MPs to hold his seat in the Scottish National party revival in last December’s general election, Ross will work in tandem with Ruth Davidson, the former leader, who will act as his de facto deputy at Holyrood.In an unorthodox move, Davidson will return from the backbenches to face Sturgeon at first minister’s questions until the Scottish parliament is dissolved next March before the Holyrood elections in May.Davidson is stepping down as MSP for Edinburgh Central in March before joining the Lords as a life peer. In a sign of the Tories’ anxieties about Sturgeon’s soaring popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, Davidson has deferred her appointment to the Lords until then.Ross and Davidson are expected to try to reassert the centrist, one-nation Tory policies Davidson championed before she resigned suddenly in August last year, partly in protest at Boris Johnson’s election as UK leader.In a joint article for the Scottish Daily Mail on Tuesday, which made no mention of Brexit or the prime minister, the pair said their goals were defending the UK, attacking Sturgeon’s domestic record and promoting economic recovery.“For us, unionism is not an end but a means – to a fairer and more prosperous Scotland,” they said.Ross and Davidson said their alliance was based “on a genuine belief, born out of experience, that SNP rule isn’t as inevitable as some people feel. We abhor the sense of defeatism that has crept into some quarters and we want to show the fight is there for the winning.”The SNP and other opposition parties are likely to attack Ross and Davidson over their unusual parliamentary roles, and Ross’s continuing part-time job as an assistant football referee. Although he expects to win a Holyrood seat in May, Ross is currently an MP, with no direct say over devolved policymaking, and Davidson has announced she is quitting Holyrood.The SNP signalled its intention to attack Ross’s politics on Tuesday by posting a tweet accusing him of having “a long history of racist views” because he called for tougher enforcement action against Travellers in his constituency in an online interview in 2017.Accused of defamation by senior Tories, the SNP later deleted the tweet Ross had apologised for that remark and withdrawn it in a BBC interview on Monday, saying his stance then was “wrong”.Party sources believe Ross will keep the party’s Holyrood frontbench in their current posts, including his official deputy, Annie Wells, a Glasgow MSP."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/675b010e23bb9d2d1a6a3623e3d46180ae099503/0_45_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3635b3e514a505b78a23f3ea6b599762","title":"uk coronavirus live schools open england childrens commissioner covid 19 latest updates","story":"Nicola Sturgeon orders closure of pubs and restaurants, plus bans on non-essential travel and indoor meetingsPolice Scotland will run extra patrols around Aberdeen, the force has said, as it seeks to enforce the local lockdown conditions. Its deputy chief constable Will Kerr has said:Our approach to these local restrictions will reflect the consistent approach taken by Police Scotland since the outset of this pandemic, and our officers will continue to engage, educate and encourage people to comply, as we all support the public health efforts to stop the spread of the virus.As a national service, Police Scotland is able to quickly flex capacity to support local communities across the country, and we will provide whatever additional resources are necessary to protect and support the communities affected.The chief constable has made it consistently clear that we all should take personal responsibility to do the right thing and remember the purpose of these measures is to aid the collective effort to stay safe, protect others and save lives by preventing the virus from spreading.Throughout the response to the pandemic, the majority of the public followed the law and Scottish government advice. I realise that this situation will be frustrating for people in the affected area but it’s really important that we all continue to do so. Our officers will continue to explain the legislation and guidance but, for the minority who may choose to breach the regulations and risk the health of others, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action where appropriate.The results come as the industry continues to face cancellations and redundancies, after Spain was removed from the UK government’s travel corridor list on 26 July. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) has forecast 3 million job losses across the UK tourism sector with “uncoordinated” restrictions deterring travellers.Referring to the ONS analysis of the shielding population, the shadow disabilities minister Vicky Foxcroft has said:Sadly, these statistics confirm what Labour has been warning for some time, issuing back to work notices for the clinical vulnerable with no support has left many facing an impossible choice between their health and their livelihood.The government must publish the scientific advice it has received confirming it is safe for disabled and clinically vulnerable people to stop shielding. They must urgently confirm how those who cannot return to their workplace will be supported, how many people this affects and what steps they are taking to communicate this to the shielding community.The Scottish Tourism Alliance and UK Hospitality groups have responded to the first minister’s announcement on new restrictions in Aberdeen. A spokeswoman has said:Today’s announcement that restrictions will be imposed in Aberdeen from 5pm today for at least the next seven days will come as a devastating blow to the many hospitality businesses who have invested significant amounts of money in reopening and providing a safe experience to their staff and the public. Aberdeen serves as an example of how quickly the virus can reignite and illustrates the immediate impact that this has on a local economy and public health.It is absolutely critical that all businesses and customers follow the government guidelines and safety protocols stringently and that we safeguard as best as we can to prevent this situation happening elsewhere in the country.Today’s news comes as a shock and should serve as a reminder that disregarding these guidelines has almost immediate consequences, however we must also recognise that many people and businesses are enjoying the easing of restrictions in a safe way that poses little threat to public safety.Further sector specific support will be required in the short to medium to enable hospitality businesses to continue to trade beyond this period of instability and retain jobs in our local economies.Reacting to the news of the Aberdeen lockdown, Tracy Black, the director of the business organisation CBI Scotland, has said:Aberdeen won’t be the last local area that faces renewed restrictions in the coming months, so the Scottish government must do everything it can to provide clear, timely advice and appropriate support to firms and iniduals. That’s a must to maintain public confidence.This will be a particular blow to the local hospitality sector, which has now faced a double-whammy of lockdowns, and emphasises the need for government support to evolve in-line with the trajectory of the virus.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, said the Scottish government and city council had made the right decision but she questioned why John Swinney, the deputy first minister blamed for overseeing controversial school exam results on Tuesday, was being put in charge of the Aberdeen outbreak.There are numerous other ministers capable of leading this response and the choice of Mr Swinney cannot be used to escape scrutiny of the exam results fiasco. He had one job to do and he has spectacularly failed at that, so I wouldn’t put him in charge of anything else.Sturgeon raises the prospect of banning pub crawls across Scotland if the evidence shows they are posing a problem. Referring to the fact that more than 20 places are now thought to be linked to the Aberdeen outbreak, she said:It could be that what we see here is a pattern that has involved people going from one pub to another on the same night. Now, it may be that we have to look at some of those lessons to think about whether we need to tighten up some of the restrictions about how hospitality is operating across the wider country.The first minister says the Scottish government is looking at measures beyond the furlough scheme it can put in place to help businesses and workers. She says she will speak to the UK government about its plans as well.Sturgeon has told the briefing in Edinburgh that she’s aware the changes are unwelcome news.The last thing we want to do is to reimpose these restrictions but this outbreak is reminding us just how highly infectious Covid is.Our precautionary and careful judgment is that we need to take decisive action now, difficult as that undoubtedly is, in order to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.As I said earlier, this is about doing all we can to ensure our children can return to schools next week. Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and the space to protect the ability of our young people to return to education.The first minister warns people not to be complacent and says Scotland’s testing and contact-tracing system is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. She asks all people to abide by the government guidelines on social distancing in order to stop the virus from spreading in the first place.Sturgeon says no one in Scotland who has tested positive within the past 28 days died on Tuesday – the 20th such day in a row.This measurement differs to the NRS data, she says, because the latter counts cases where the virus is noted on the death certificate as a contributory factor, meaning its scope is wider.She says a total of 2,491 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19. Sturgeon says 18,781 people have tested positive for the virus, up by 64 from 18,717 the day before.There were 267 people in hospital with confirmed Covid-19, down by three. Of these, three were in intensive care, which was no change.Sturgeon says staff who have been brought back to work from furlough can be furloughed again. She says she’s “very sorry” she’s having to reimpose restrictions on the city, but insists “decisive action” is necessary to stop the outbreak getting out of hand.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said 54 cases have now been confirmed in the Aberdeen Covid-19 cluster, while 191 close contacts have been traced, though she expects that number to increase. Across Scotland, 64 new cases have been recorded with 36 thought to be in Grampian.Sturgeon says there may be some community transmission and, while the outbreak may be centred on one city centre bar, it is not the only source and many more are being looked at.Sturgeon says that, as a result, restrictions will be reimposed in the Aberdeen city council area.People are being told not to travel to Aberdeen if they are not already there. A five-mile travel rule has been put in place and residents are also being told not to enter each other’s houses. All indoor and outdoor hospitality has also been told to close by 5pm on Wednesday.The closure will be backed by governmental regulations, the first minister says, and will be enforced if the rules are not followed.Sturgeon adds that the changes will be reviewed next Wednesday, when she hoped that they could be removed if they could, either in entirety or in part. However, if necessary, Sturgeon has said they could be extended beyond that seven-day period.According to the National Records of Scotland (NRS), seven deaths were registered that mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate between Monday 27 July and Sunday 2 August a decrease of one from the previous week.The NRS said that was the second lowest weekly total for deaths since the first death was recorded in early March. Pete Whitehouse, the NRS’s director of statistical services, said:Loss of life from this virus is tragic and every death represents loss and heartbreak for families throughout the country.Today’s figures show seven more deaths due to Covid-19, showing a similar level for three consecutive weeks. These figures are significantly lower than the peak week in mid-April when 661 Covid-19 related deaths were registered.Monitoring the progress of this virus is important and National Records of Scotland will continue to work with Scottish government and Health Protection Scotland (HPS) to understand its impact in Scotland.The GMB union also called on ministers to allow school staff to wear face masks if they want to when they return in September. Rehana Azam, GMB’s national secretary, said:Our members tell us they are scared of what’s to come in September and they feel it’s strange the government tells them to wear masks on the way to work, and if they go to get lunch, but not when they are in school.The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) is calling for greater clarity on whether schools can permit face masks if pupils or staff want them. Its general secretary, Geoff Barton, said the guidance left key questions unanswered.One, how should schools respond if pupils and staff want to wear face coverings? Two, do they have the flexibility to introduce the use of face coverings in constricted spaces where there is more mixing, for example in narrow corridors? We are seeking answers from the government to these questions.Government guidance warns the misuse of face coverings may “inadvertently increase the risk of transmission” in schools and there could be “negative effects” on communication and education.Among those putting pressure on ministers to change their approach is the teachers’ union, NASUWT. It has called on the Department for Education (DfE) to revise its guidance on face coverings “as a matter of urgency” to help staff return to school in the autumn with “confidence”.The union said the government should encourage school and college staff to wear clear facial visors if there are concerns that teaching and learning may be impeded by the use of face masks.Its general secretary, Patrick Roach, said the position in schools was “out of step” with public health guidance that suggests face masks should be worn when physical distancing cannot be assured. In a letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, Roach said:Strategies for minimising contact between pupils and staff (ie ‘bubbles’) are unlikely to be effective given constraints of building design, limitations of space within schools, and the inability of schools to control for wider social interactions involving children and adults within and outside their perimeters.We strongly suggest that your guidance for schools should now be brought into line with changes to the government’s guidance for other sectors, public transport, shops and supermarkets.Face coverings for older schoolchildren should be considered, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has said.Earlier, the schools minister, Nick Gibb, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that secondary school pupils will not be forced to wear face coverings when they return in the autumn.But Ashworth said Labour would accept “tough decisions” to make sure all children can get back to class after months of partial closures.According to the government guidance, face coverings are not required as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups – and the guidance says they should be removed on arrival at the school gates.Hello, this is Kevin Rawlinson taking over from Lucy Campbell for much of the rest of the day.I’ll try to keep an eye on the comments below the line but the most reliable way to alert my attention to something is via Twitter: KevinJRawlinson.

gamblers should prove they can afford losses report finds","story":"Social Market Foundation will call for a £100-per-month ‘soft cap’ on online lossesOnline gamblers should not be able to lose more than £100 a month without proving they can afford it, according to a report that will also call for betting websites that base themselves offshore to face stiffer taxes.Proposals from the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank build on growing clamour for the government to make sweeping changes to how the industry is regulated, following a string of high-profile stories about problem gambling.Among wide-ranging recommendations due to be published on Wednesday, the SMF will call for:The report recommends online gambling should be regulated much more like land-based bets, include a stake limit of between £1 and £5 on online slot machines, echoing similar proposals from a group of MPs.The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was cut from £100 to £2 from 2019 but at present there are no stake limits online.“Remote gambling is on the rise, yet remains outside the same controls applied to its land-based equivalents,” the SMF said.“It makes no sense that the same ‘obligation’ to reduce harm through limits to stake and speed should not be applied to an online sector which provides the most accessible content of all.”One of the most eye-catching proposals is a £100 “soft cap” on monthly losses, with customers who want to spend more subjected to strict affordability checks by an independent gambling ombudsman.Industry trade body the Betting \u0026amp Gaming Council (BGC) said its members already carry out affordability checks in some cases.“We disagree with the suggestion of an arbitrary and random low cap on spending and can think of no other area of the economy where the government determines how much an inidual can spend,” the BGC said.“Measures must be proportionate, evidence-led and fully thought through so as not to jeopardise the 100,000 jobs the industry supports or the over £3bn in tax revenues it generates for the Exchequer.”But the report questions whether the industry is paying its fair share, outlining reforms that would have significant ramifications for betting firms.The government levies a duty on online bets to ensure at least some tax is collected from firms that base themselves in offshore centres such as Malta and Gibraltar.But the SMF proposed tax incentives for companies that have a minimum “footprint” in the UK, to boost corporation tax receipts.The report’s authors said this would also create jobs and promote compliance with British gambling licence conditions, including the protection of vulnerable people and addicts.A similar proposal would bring an end to so-called “white label” agreements, where foreign firms with little incentive to protect UK consumers can buy access to the British market via an existing gambling licence holder.The SMF added its voice to calls for an overhaul of the 2005 Gambling Act, introduced under Tony Blair’s Labour government, citing changes in technology that “could not have been foreseen when the legislation underpinning that regulatory framework was first drafted”.The government has pledged to review the law and the public policy thinktanks called on ministers to consider redesigning the regulatory architecture it created.The report proposes a more strictly defined framework of sanctions available to the regulator, the Gambling Commission, which has admitted it is underfunded and has come in for criticism in two parliamentary reports.Changes would include a kitemarking scheme to promote good behaviour and additional regulators to beef up scrutiny of the sector and engage multiple government departments in oversight of the sector."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/318dfe95b31fbb92944d775ead52162210c35d73/0_50_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d8aab3538e10e156152959d196af73","title":"tell

But he acknowledged that things would become “very difficult” if the situation did not improve early in 2021.“That figure of £30m sounds quite healthy but there’s a world of difference between £30m with the arrow pointing upwards and the same figure when the arrow’s pointing downwards. We’ve always said we don’t want to be in a position where we ourselves are starting to worry about where the next pound is coming from because the effect that that has on industry confidence is quite significant, so we don’t want to over-commit.”Betting turnover figures have been encouraging since racing resumed in June, Delmonte said. “But that can’t be assumed to continue, in an environment where we know that the furlough scheme is coming to an end in the autumn. You just don’t know what the effect will be on consumer spending and confidence.”“But that just buys you four months with the hope that things start to turn the corner in early 2021.”David Bridgwater is one of those jumps trainers who can have fruitful summers and his Fukuto (2.20) is of interest at 6-1, making his chase debut in a novice handicap. A winning hurdler in France, his freegoing nature has played against him in this country so far, as he has mostly competed on very testing ground and run out of puff well before the end.Perhaps he is just intractable but today’s much sounder surface and a sharp track should help, and he has dropped two and a half stones in the ratings in the space of a year and a half. I’m happy to take a chance on him.Pagero (3.20) has more obvious claims at 7-4, for all that he has been raised a stone for two easy wins in December. He is still young enough to have plenty more to offer and Jonjo O’Neill’s few runners are faring well just now.Tindrum (7.35) is interesting at Lingfield tonight, although that interest may not survive long, as two of his three visits to the races have ended in disaster at the stalls, with a refusal to enter and an unseat on exiting. The one time he actually competed, he was green as anything in a maiden the week after resumption at Haydock, but showed some talent in running on late.He comes from a yard that can get big-priced maiden winners and is fairly priced at 25-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78dc14bb076f71a9f4474581f51060367e95e3c8/362_0_3001_1801/master/3001.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0973e757c22db3281e40ae04b4c964c","title":"england v pakistan first test day one live","story":"36th over: Pakistan 100-2 (Babar Azam 39 Shan Masood 38) Babar Azam brings up the Pakistan hundred, and overtakes Masood with a square drive, knees just so: boundary. He’d already unleashed, no that’s a too vulgar, embroidered, a cover drive earlier in the over for another four. 35th over: Pakistan 90-2 (Babar Azam 30 Shan Masood 37) Babar drives - makes it look so easy - Archer’s first ball for four. Style and grace. And so the score ticks on. Detective Derek Stocker: “TMS commentary. Bess spins himself a catch, licks his fingers and runs in.Is that a whoops moment?” If so... yes! I’ll keep my eye on it.34th over: Pakistan 85-2 (Babar Azam 25 Shan Masood 37) “An English off-spinner bowling to a set Pakistani top order on the first day of a Test in England. It’s not gonna end well,” grumbles Richard Holmes. Richard, Richard, look, here’s a Bess maiden for you. Let’s give him time.33rd over: Pakistan 85-2 (Babar Azam 25 Shan Masood 37) Perhaps for surprise value, Broad releases a short fat full toss which Azam punch-drives for four. He dead-bats the rest of the over. I knew it! Romeo, this is for you. To help Romeo answer his question I’d recommend the British Newspaper Archive, a paid service from the British Library that can be searched for free,” writes Tam Watson. “For example, an edition of the Derby Mercury from Wednesday 10th December 1873 quotes Wisden 1874 as saying:“Derbyshire played a Colts’ match, a test match between the North and South of the shire...”Which suggests to me the phrase was in currency at the time for a big occasion if not for full internationals.”32nd over: Pakistan 81-2 (Babar Azam 21 Shan Masood 37) Enough Jimmy! Root turns to spin and the lesser-bowled Dom Bess. He pitches the first few outside off stump and they go through for a couple off an over that didn’t probe particularly.32nd over: Pakistan 79-2 (Babar Azam 20 Shan Masood 36) After immaculately playing out Broad’s over, Masood, clad in a short sleeved jumper, shuffle-flicks a short one to square leg. Four. Rattling along nicely here for Pakistan.31st over: Pakistan 74-2 (Babar Azam 20 Shan Masood 31) A back foot four from Babar, beautiful balance, an extra-cover caress. Anderson, already pissed off by a no-ball called earlier in the over by the third umpire unleashes one of his hardest stares. Time for a bowling change?“ Afternoon Tanya Fascinating morning’s play, but we can’t get Azam’s wicket quickly enough. Not because I’m a chauvanistic Englishman, but because I’ve got the Beach Boys stuck in my head and need it gone.”Martin Whitaker you’re not the only one. Over to you, Brian Withington:“In the spirit of injecting unnecessary razzmatazz into the great red ball game, there is always the option of walk on music to accompany batsmen to the crease. Babar Azam could of course ear-worm his way in to the Beach Boys’ Barbara Ann,”30th over: Pakistan 69-2 (Babar Azam 16 Shan Masood 31) Clouds bulking ominously above the Old Trafford Point. Broad saves the best ball of his maiden till last, pitching long and squeaking past the pushing bat of Masood.29th over: Pakistan 69-2 (Babar Azam 16 Shan Masood 31) Anderson drifts towards Babar Azam’s legs - big mistake. He pings it with a flick to the square leg boundary. A couple more come through midwicket. Broad and Anderson are proving less potent after lunch than Woakes and Archer were before. 28th over: Pakistan 63-2 (Babar Azam 10 Shan Masood 31) Masood pushes a short one from Broad and kisses it for four down past point.I’m in love with the Pakistan tracksuit tops. Orange-gold arms and upper torso, pine lower torso. A good handful of the squad team walk round the the boundary to the Old Trafford nets.27th over: Pakistan 58-2 (Babar Azam 9 Shan Masood 27) Barbar Azam, neat beard and moustache visible through his helmet, short sleeved shirt, clops leg-side Anderson slop for four to the fine leg boundary then nips a less assured squirty single.26th over: Pakistan 53-2 (Babar Azam 4 Shan Masood 27) Masood plays and misses at Broad’s first ball after lunch, and Broad varies long then short throughout the over. We have a first-hand witness: “I’m a long time OBO reader, first time contributor,” taps Gina.“I was in that 2019 CWC Opening Ceremony (on the far left in the Viv Richards photo) and can confirm that not only was Chris Hughes present, but also that he is a very useful batsman, as one of his cover drives hit me hard on the knee at close range. Oh, and England (CH and KP) won that game of street cricket, a portent of the CWC itself!”“Is it my imagination or have there been fewer than usual bowled wickets this summer by England? asks Richard Mansell. “Lots of catches and LBWs, very few clean bowled. Actually, looking through the WI scorecards England took two wickets by clean bowling every innings in the first two Tests (usually near the tail), and just one in the third. The Windies (Roach and Gabriel in particular) got more wickets by clean bowling.”“What is the average per innings of wickets falling from being bowled? And has this changed over time? Does it vary between teams (batting and bowling)?”A quick google isn’t helping me. I know I’ve read this somewhere - perhaps in Tim de Lisle’s Young Wisden. It makes sense that there must be variations according to team and conditions and probably era. I’m nominating Wasim and Waqar for a high percentage of wickets clean bowled. Thanks for all the emails and sorry not to have got to them all. Romeo writes with the sort of question that an OBO reader will answer.I have a question for owners of the 1877 and 1878 editions of Wisden and also s of ’s archive. Is there any reference in either to ‘Test Match’ in relation to the matches played in what is now described as the first Test series?Bill Frindall said in 2001 (http:news.bbcsport1hisports_talk1723724.stm) that “The phrase ‘test match’ was coined in 1861-62 during the very first cricket tour of Australia. The contests between HH Stephenson’s English team and each of the Australian colonies were described as ‘test matches’.The Brisbane Courier of 5 March 1877 doesn’t use the word ‘test’ but refers to ‘the international match’.Basic question is when did it become a common term.Fascinating chat between Wasim Khan, ex-Chance to Shine and Leicestershire, now PCB chairman, and Mike Atherton. Wasim says England (who haven’t toured since 2005) are due to come in 2022 but he is hoping they might come for a short tour before. Says it is difficult for Pakistan to dispute the perception that the country is unsafe. Their best spokespeople have come from the 35 overseas players who played in the PSL. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka the only countries so far to have toured since the country re-opened. To put your collective minds at rest before lunch, news on Chris Hughes. Afternoon Tanya, afternoon everyone, writes Andrew Cosgrove.I am sitting in sun-kissed South London bewildered by the concept of rain stopped play.What I like most about that wikipedia page about the world cup opening party is that of all the celebrities listed, Chris Hughes is the only one without a link through to a wikipedia page. Not even wikipedia knows who he is.  I’m just going to grab a sandwich for fortification after that intriguing opening session. Back in 10 mins!25th over: Pakistan 53-2 (Babar Azam 4 Shan Masood 27) Woakes the smiling assassin, w0bbling the seam. Barbar is turned round by a beauty that nips off the pitch past his outside edge. Tremendous bowling by Woakes - no discernible relief for the Pakistan batsmen when Broad-Anderson were exchanged for Woakes-Archer. First blood to England as they go off for lunch.24th over: Pakistan 51-2 (Babar Azam 2 Shan Masood 27) Another spicy over from Archer but Babar safely negotiates the penultimate over before lunch.23rd over: Pakistan 50-2 (Babar Azam 1 Shan Masood 27) And with a cry, Babar gets off the mark with shove to the covers. Earlier in the over Root had considered reviewing a Woakes LBW shout - his indecision was right as it pitched outside.Thank you Tim!22nd over: Pakistan 48-2 (Babar Azam 0 Shan Masood 26) A maiden as Archer eases silkily to the crease. Azam has gone 14 balls without scoring.I like it, though Chapel en le Frithers will point out that the “capital of the peak” is in Derbyshire. Beautiful but bleak.21st overs: Pakistan 48-2 (Babar Azam 0 Shan Masood 26) Another streaky four for Masood, the ball screaming off the edge to brush the ing Sibley’s fingertips. An lbw appeal dies on Woakes’ lips. Excellent bowling. 20 overs: Pakistan 44-2 (Babar Azam 0 Shan Masood 22) Archer has the wind behind him today, angels at his feet, nippy, aggressive, varying his length.Peter Haining, meanwhile, has his head in his hands“It’s there on wikipedia,” says Peter Haining with his head in his hands.  “TV personality Chris Hughes? Is he? was he? Who?And Malala. I don’t even try to understand.”With the rain break the scheduled close is 6.08pm.19 overs: Pakistan 44-2 (Babar Azam 0 Shan Masood 22) Pakistan’s big hope walks to the crease and is greeted by a first-ball snorter from Woakes which is full and rises to within a sneeze - a hiccup - of off stump. In his last five Tests, Babar has scored four centuries.The Pakistan captain goes for a duck - but not before reviewing - unsuccessfully. A full ball that would have cannoned into the stumps.18 overs: Pakistan 43-1 (Azhar Ali 0 Shan Masood 18) Sky run a three-way split screen on Archer showing him in his delivery stride - one of the balls is full, the other two short. There is no discernible way of knowing which is the short one - what a nightmare for batsmen. Warnie get it though - whatever his faults, his cricketing brain is immaculate. Another superb over by Archer just a four from Masood who gets an invisible touch and sends the ball flying through gully.17 overs: Pakistan 39-1 (Azhar Ali 0 Shan Masood 18) An excellent stop by Buttler behind the stumps as the ball seems to drop without warning. Three to Masood. And so we go on.John Sharp would like to add a slight twist to the bowl out.I like Mr Copestake’s idea but would prefer it if Mr Cummings was the facing batsman during the ceremonial opening ball. Dom could be reassured he wouldn’t need all the protective kit because it would only be a gentle opener from, say, a local PHE Director. Then ask Dr Steyn (whose post Cricket career in Public Health is now revealed) to bowl him a livener. I think that would be popular.16 overs: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar Ali 0 Shan Masood 15) The players stroll back on after that short break and Archer finishes his over with two dots.15.4 overs: Pakistan 36-1 (Azhar Ali 0 Shan Masood 15) The rain starts to fall after the Pakistan captain has faced three balls. Hover cover, no sheets. That was a lip-smacking ball by Archer, who has mixed up his deliveries this morning. After softening Ali up with a couple of bouncers at the end of his last over, this was on a length, Ali shuffled towards it a bit late and the ball shuttled into his off stump. Ping. “I really enjoyed the wide range of people involved in the opening ceremony for the 2019 World Cup. In one part of the ceremony every country brought along a celebrity to represent them in a cricket match, and whilst England chose someone from Love Island whose name escapes me Pakistan went for Noble Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai (no, really, Malala Yousafzai). It definitely had the feel of something that hadn’t been discussed beforehand.”That can’t be true. Surely that can’t be true...Castled! Full and stumps splayed. 15th over: Pakistan 35-0 (Abid Ali 16 Shan Masood 15) An excellent first hour here from Pakistan who have safely negociated 14 overs of dissecting bowling from Broad and Anderson, and now Woakes and Archer. England’s batsmen will be delighted to hear that the pitch is so dry that foot holes are already developing for the Pakistan spinners to exploit. A couple of singles off Woakes’ over. 14th over: Pakistan 34-0 (Abid Ali 15 Shan Masood 14) The bowling knitting committee of Broad and Anderson consult at the top of Archer’s mark as he prepares to bowl his first over. Archer has had a hair do -neat zig zags shaved into his scalp. We wait four balls, the fifth is a bouncer on an immaculate line that would have removed Ali’s head had he not bent his knees and fallen like a foal to the ground. A slightly less potent bouncer follows. The rain, by the way, has stopped.“Harkarn Sumal suggests a grand way to liven up this English summer day,” taps Ian Copestake. “I would like to involve fielding positions as part of the opening ceremonial and, if his eyes are up to it, invite Dominic Cummings to try long-off but with a freedom to wander to the boundary if and when it suits him..”13th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Abid Ali 14 Shan Masood 13) The rain starts to fall, and the groundstaff sprint into readiness. But they stay on as as Woakes sends down another accurate maiden. 12th over: Pakistan 32-0 (Abid Ali 14 Shan Masood 13) Broad is given another over, challenging, but Ali is up to the task and knocks a quick single from the last ball . Harkarn, not quite Diana Ross, but I give you model Caprice and TV presenter Anneka Rice who were excruciatingly persuaded into promoting the 1999 World Cup held in England. Rice admitted in her first interview that she found the game boring.11th over: Pakistan 30-0 (Abid Ali 13 Shan Masood 12)The first bowling change of the day as Chris Woakes (black headband, full beard) replaces Jimmy Anderson (just-so hair, designer stubble). A maiden.As The Hundred has been postponed for a year, it gives us the chance to think of new and enterprising ways of ruining cricket in the meantime. I’ve been applying a good deal of though to this, and one innovation that we could import and cannibalise from our cousins across the pond is an equivalent of baseball’s “ceremonial first pitch”. It’s a top-drawer low-brow bit of pantomime buffoonery, which could be inserted before play at every level of the professional game. So the match sponsor (e.g. the owner of the local bakery or carpet warehouse) turning up and turning their arm over for one delivery one week at a county or T20 game, a local first-round ejectee from a Saturday night shiny-floor singing contest show or the mayor doing so for the Hundred, right up to an appropriate dignitary for the international stuff. You know the drill Christopher Biggins lobbing up an off-break for a T20 international, George Osborne getting pelters from the crowd for his inswinger that surreptitiously moves away to the right prior to an ODI, and the likes of Joanna Lumley being wheeled out to do the honours for a test match. The more shambolic the better. Think Diana Ross attempting a penalty at the 1994 World Cup.Suggestions of celeb\u0026ampformat combos are welcomed from your other reader!10th over: Pakistan 29-0 (Abid Ali 12 Shan Masood 12) Ali plays a ball into his stomach, which bounces on the ground and Broad, to the bewilderment of the watching Buttler, charges in and left-foots the ball just wide of the stumps. Meanwhile Ollie Pope dons the helmet at short leg.“Interesting that England have listed Broad above Archer on their teamsheet” ponders Richard O’Hagan. “Entirely justified on recent performances, it’s been almost as good to see Broad getting his batting mojo back as it has been to see him bowl.” Good spot and absolutely deserved. I imagine that Broad has taken his slip down the batting order entirely in his stride.9th over: Pakistan 27-0 (Abid Ali 11 Shan Masood 11) Consecutive fours off Anderson as Ali first turns a loose ball off his pads down to the boundary, then flays one through gully and just over the fingertips of the ing Burns.8th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Abid Ali 3 Shan Masood 10) Under the stern Old Trafford floodlights, Broad continues from the Brian Staham End, shiny red orb gripped just-so in his hand. Ali plays out the over nicely until the last ball which he eyes up, drives flamboyantly and gets an inside edge onto his pad.7th over: Pakistan 18-0 (Abid Ali 3 Shan Masood 10) Masood continues to irritate Anderson with a thick edge through the slips to the boundary. Jimmy neighs and pounds the grass with his feet. 6th over: Pakistan 13-0 (Abid Ali 2 Shan Masood 6) It is one long sleeved jumper weather out there. Masood cuts Broad at head height, turning the wrists to send the ball past point for four. Pakistan’s first boundary of the day.“Morning Tanya,” writes Ian in sunny Turkey, “really looking forward to this series against Pakistan. It will be a great test for both teams, with their strong bowling line ups and still unpredictable batting line ups especially for Pakistan in English conditions, we shall see how the new sensation Babar copes with the moving ball both through the air and off the pitch especially against the rejuvenated Broad and Joe Root and Buttler are due for big scores anytime soon. I just hope my internet doesn’t crash.”5th over: Pakistan 8-0 (Abid Ali 1 Shan Masood 2) An inside edge squeaks off Masood’s bat in a not completely controlled way. Anderson’s next ball squares up Ali. He’s on the money. Rory Burns not only hasn’t had a haircut but is wearing the kind of beard you might purchase for a Christmas stocking.4th over: Pakistan 7-0 (Abid Ali 1 Shan Masood 1) A haphazard leg-bye, but no runs from Broad’s second over to the empty stadium“I was interested to hear Nassar Hussain’s opinion that Babar Azam has been scoring heavily since he started to play the ball more under his nose.” types Steve Hudson, “The impressively-beconked Nassar always found this particularly easy, so he knows what he’s talking about.” As the owner of a sizeable conk myself, I’ve always had time for Nasser’s noble nose.3rd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Abid Ali 1 Shan Masood 1) Masood is twice beaten outside the off stump by Anderson, this feels a bit like a matter of time. I hope I’m wrongHere are Gary Naylor’s talking points from the first round of the Bob Willis Trophy. Such an exciting day’s cricket yesterday - four nail-biters and giant killing by Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Middlesex and Worcestershire.2nd over: Pakistan 2-0 (Abid Ali 1 Shan Masood 1) Pakistan nip a couple of quick singles off Broad’s over. Nasser points out the difficulty Masood had leaving the ball last time he was in England. Watch and wait.“Really looking forward to this series, not just to see Pakistan’s bowling,” taps Toby Sims, “but also very importantly, the team lockdown haircut competition...”Root, I don’t think, has hit the barbers. Broad is still in his white bandana with wild locks. I think Stokes has been shorn, but I’d need him to take his hat off to be sure. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Abid Ali 0 Shan Masood 0) James Anderson takes the ball from his, less favoured, James Anderson End ,and serves up a predictably probing, accurate maiden. A beauty slips past a probing Masood as he props forward. The players line up for the national anthems, now a minutes silence for all those round the world affected by Covid-19.Pakistan will BAT -arghgh - thanks to all those who pointed out my, what Bob o’Hara called, brain fart. Meanwhile Peter Haining pre-guesses the inbox with the overseas TMS link. Click here. Thank you Peter.And Nasser Hussain puts the fear of god into England fans by an adulation of Babar Azam, who averages 64.57 since 2018, and, Sky have discovered, is playing the ball later and later and more underneath his nose.A note from my colleague Ali Martin. The players will not be taking the knee today in solidarity with Black Lives Matters. This from the ECB:“The players wore the Black Lives Matter logo and took the knee throughout the West Indies series in solidarity and respect to the message and our rivals. It remains a hugely important issue for both the ECB and the players as there is no place for discrimination of any kind in cricket or society.“The ECB is continuing to develop plans and consult with the game to make cricket more inclusive and erse, and we recently set out a range of action we are taking to address some of the feedback we’ve received as we seek to drive real change.”Warnie is waxing lyrical about Pakistan’s two legs-spinners, Yasir Shar - who he says spins the ball both ways, has all the toys and just needs the right fields -and Shadab Khan, who had been due to join Surrey for their Blast cricket this season.Azhar Ali says they’re going in with three seamers and two leg spinners.England have chosen an unchanged XI - which presumably means Ben Stokes won’t bowl. Root says he’d have batted first but looking forward to exploiting the overhead conditions.You’ll remember that England have lost eight of their last ten first-Tests of a series, including against Pakistan in 2018.Rob riffed on it hereAlso, that England haven’t beaten Pakistan in a Test series for a decade.The first email of the day pings in:“As long as it remains dry, the cricket should start on time. I’m very excited to watch Babar - and the continued growth of England’s opening pair, who are doing exactly the job asked of them (batting time, establishing a platform). Burns and Sibley are both averaging more than 42, since the Ashesdebut.”Good stat James Debens! Though I’m nervous about Burns and Sibley opening this morning against this Pakistan in these conditions. Toss is imminent.And here is the pitch. Note the grassy outfield - it hosed it down last night (as it has much of the last month).And in other news, this series will be used as a trial for the TV umpire to call front-foot no-balls for the first time in Tests.Here is the forecast. You might wish you hadn’t looked.And for those of you who want to relive the astonishing ODI against Ireland last night, here’s Vic Marks purring with delight.If yesterday was Ireland and last week was West Indies, today must be Pakistan - and there can be no better way to start a grizzled Wednesday morning in Manchester than a Test match against them - the first of three, followed by three T20s.Pakistan last played a Test in February, so are without England’s intense match practise, but they have been quietly going about their business in the UK since the end of June. A journalist who watched them at both their warm-up matches at Derby said the batting was very reliant on Babar Azam but their bowling was a match for England’s.The man - boy - causing the greatest excitement is Naseem Shah, the 17 year old with the flowing side-on action that Michael Vaughan has compared to Fred Trueman’s. Just 17, he can bowl at 90mph, swing the ball both ways and already has a Test hat-trick, against Bangladesh earlier this year. One fears for England’s stumps. He is complemented by Shaheen Afridi, who so impressed in last year’s World Cup.Babar Azam is the pick of the batting. His last tour of England in 2018 ended after just one innings when his wrist was broken by a ball from Ben Stokes during 68 at Lord’s. He is now the third ranked batsmen in ODIs and the sixth ranked in Tests - and has been compared by his captain to Steve Smith and Virat Kohli in terms of talent.

Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/159804e20a5e2052ecd1e0e5d4641be21599400d/0_359_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fa88fba633ad6516ac883940fa5f7d","title":"first time uk campers tell us about your experiences","story":"Lockdown restrictions and desire to remain within country caused so-called ‘staycation’ boom as people flock to campsitesWe would like to hear from readers who have gone – or are about to go – on a camping holiday in the UK for the first time due to travel restrictions and a desire to stay within the UK.Why are you a newbie camper?

The BBC are set to produce a scripted comedy based around one such facility, partnering with a production company which specialises in helping young people enter the TV and film industry.The pilot, titled PRU, is a collaboration between the corporation’s online-only channel BBC Three, targeted at 16- to 34-year-olds, and the youth-led production company Fully Focused. Aiming to “authentically capture the unpredictable nature of PRU life, a world seldom seen by the public”, it will follow four “complex but seemingly self-destructive kids who say the unsayable and do the undoable”.Director Teddy Nygh and writers Alex Tenenbaum and Nathaniel Stevens have experience working with young people, including those in referral units, while Fully Focused helps young people from underrepresented backgrounds enter the creative industries.The young people Fully Focused works with have “‘lived experience’ of the issues we portray in our drama, comedy and documentaries”, Henry said. “This includes young people who’ve attended PRUs, have experience of the youth justice system and are known to borough youth offending teams.” As well as providing support and mentoring, Fully Focused allows young people to use their own experiences to inform their work with the organisation.Shane Allen, the BBC’s head of comedy commissioning, described the script as crackling with “terrific dialogue from sharply drawn characters in a world we haven’t seen before in sitcoms – all imbued with truth, heart and hilarity. Fully Focused bring their ethos and emphasis on authenticity and representation of young voices both on and off camera.”Previous BBC Three pilots or Comedy Slices include People Just Do Nothing and Liam Williams’ Ladhood.Founded in 2010, Fully Focused channels its profits into training programmes, and runs a YouTube channel, Million Youth Media, showcasing short films made by the young people it works with. PRU’s four teenage leads will be found via an open casting call, which launches online today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0fe50445d6862cdb5412f73b4b0656428c824a9/0_22_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ab26e2ce9e6668c90ae9896bf9a86e65","title":"britons tv covid lockdown ofcom streaming netflix amazon","story":"Ofcom says 12m UK adults signed up to streaming services such as Netflix or AmazonThe typical person spent six hours and 25 minutes each day keeping informed and entertained at the height of the lockdown in April – almost a third more, about 90 minutes each day – than during the same month last year.The biggest driver of this increase in viewing was a doubling in the amount of time people spent watching subscription streaming services – such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ – to more than a hour per day, according to broadcasting regulator Ofcom’s annual study of the nation’s media habits. Among younger audiences, those aged 16 to 34, streaming screen time jumped to two hours a day.Ofcom’s Media Nation’s 2020 report estimates that 12 million UK adults signed up to a new video streaming service during lockdown. About 7 million of those already use at least one service such as Netflix and decided to bulk up their entertainment options about 2 million had previously been signed up to a service but had stopped their subscription and 3 million were new to streaming.Before lockdown, about 15m UK homes were signed up to at least one of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Sky’s Now TV service.The lockdown provided the perfect launch conditions for Disney+, which debuted in the UK on 24 March, a day after Boris Johnson ordered the nation to stay at home.“It’s true that it has been almost perfect conditions for all the major streaming services,” said Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “Under lockdown there has been a lack of alternative entertainment options where you couldn’t see friends and cinemas, restaurants, pubs and clubs were closed. And with traditional TV there has been a relatively limited variety of shows, people were rapidly running out of things to watch.”Ofcom’s research shows that the UK’s public service TV broadcasters – the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Scotland’s STV – benefited from huge audience figures early during the lockdown but that boost proved to be short-lived.March provided the public service broadcasters with their highest combined monthly share of all broadcast TV viewing in more than six years. However, the popularity of broadcast TV peaked early in the pandemic, with daily viewing reaching three hours 46 minutes, the highest level since 2013, during the last week of March when Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown.With TV and film production halted due to the pandemic, broadcasters had to begin rationing dwindling stocks of staple hit shows such as Coronation Street and Eastenders while others were delayed or cancelled, such as Love Island and the European football championships, hurting viewing figures.Ofcom found that by the end of June while video streaming services held on to their uplift in viewing, including the BBC iPlayer, Channel 4’s All4 and ITV’s Hub, broadcast TV viewing had fallen by 44 minutes a day from its early pandemic peak.“The pandemic showed public service broadcasting at its best, delivering trusted news and UK content that viewers really value,” said Yih-Choung Teh, the strategy and research group director at Ofcom. “But UK broadcasters face a tough advertising market, production challenges and financial uncertainty. So they need to keep demonstrating that value in the face of intense competition from streaming services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1da7c97c08ae6c48f6b31600cec298179e32944/0_498_2390_1433/master/2390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f16156ac458dfed31e942fe6bc83a221","title":"press hounded caroline flack her mother tells inquest","story":"Chris Flack also says CPS let TV presenter down before her death in FebruaryThe mother of TV presenter Caroline Flack, who was found hanged at her north London home in February, said her daughter had faced a “show trial” and been hounded by the press over allegations she assaulted her boyfriend in the weeks before she took her life, an inquest heard.In a statement read to court, Chris Flack said: “I believe Caroline was seriously let down by the authorities and in particular the CPS for pursuing the case.”The 40-year-old, who hosted Love Island and The X Factor, was found dead at her flat in Stoke Newington on 15 February. She was facing trial for assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, a former tennis player and model, in December.Her sister Jody Flack said she believed Caroline had tried to kill herself in December, before her first court appearance for assault.Family and friends painted a picture of the TV star falling apart in the weeks leading up to her death, with worried friends staying with her because they were so alarmed.Asked by the coroner Mary Hassell, sitting at Poplar coroner’s court in east London, whether Flack had said “she actually wanted to kill herself”, Flack’s friend Louise Teasdale replied “yes”.Flack’s mother said the evidence in the criminal proceedings against her daughter was “disputed”. But the resulting media attention had “forced Caroline to leave her home which she loved, I believe eventually to take her own life”.Through it all, Flack was told not to “tell her side of the story”, her mother said in a statement. “The only person who was hurt that night was Caroline,” she said. “She lost the job she worked so hard at.”Flack had been called an “abuser” in the newspapers, her sister said. “Her life and reputation she worked hard to build was falling apart … because of a false accusation,” she added. Flack had “spent months hiding inside”.“Caroline seemed very sad the day before her death – she seemed to have lost her fight,” she said.She said Flack was in a “very anxious” state of mind. Ambulances had previously been called on four occasions.Tamsin Lewis, a psychiatrist and lifestyle practitioner, who was called by Flack’s personal assistant on 17 December, told the court she was told Flack was “in the middle of a media crisis and could not sleep”.She was “incredibly distressed” and tearful, Lewis said in a statement. “She was scrolling the media reports on her phone.” She had a bandaged finger, which she explained was the result of a “lovers’ tiff” with Burton, “heightened by alcohol”.Lewis added that her mood appeared low and “she reported having panicky feelings all day – a sense of impending doom”. Flack did not say she had suicidal intent, added Lewis.“She said she had been drinking excessively to numb herself. She said sleep had been impossible.”Burton, Flack’s boyfriend who she was accused of assaulting, described her as “not in a good place emotionally”, “devastated” and said she sometimes talked of taking her own life.He said in a statement: “The media were constantly bashing her character, writing hurtful stories, generally hounding her daily.” He added: “What was worrying her most was the police case and losing her presenting job on Love Island, plus not being able to see me.”Burton had asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to drop the case.David O’Toole, a paramedic called to Flack’s flat on 15 February, said it appeared she had been dead for hours. A postmortem found no traces of alcohol, but the presence of zopiclone, used for insomnia, just above the therapeutic range. Diazepam was present in a therapeutic amount. The pathologist Prof Michael Sheaff found Flack died from hanging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20ca95e3b296fc0478e96e773e9c9b8f5adf87a8/0_132_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e2548b4878fd516dfc982bf03c54541","title":"joe biden democrats running mate vice president","story":"Leading VP contenders have had to endure the usual criticisms men often direct at women – which has undermined a historic selection processThe final weeks of Joe Biden’s search for a running mate have had all the usual trimmings: leaks from unnamed Democratic party officials, last-minute suggestions of outsider names and a trail of vague hints from the candidate himself.But this year is different. Biden promised to select a female running mate, setting up a historic nomination process that many prominent Democratic women say is being overshadowed by the increasingly nasty – and unmistakably sexist – debate over who he should choose.“Even in this moment of women ascending to heights that we never have in our country’s history, it’s still really being talked about and debated through the lens of a man,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director at Care in Action, a nonprofit group that advocates for domestic workers.In the last week, prominent Democratic men, campaign advisors and anonymous donors have suggested that senator Kamala Harris, a top candidate for vice president, was too ambitious and questioned her likability.The former Connecticut senator Chris Dodd, a member of Biden’s vice-presidential vetting team, was also reportedly bothered by the lack of contrition Harris expressed over a blistering attack on Biden during an early Democratic debate – an odd point of caution for a candidate who has been in politics for decades and seen his share of heated fights. Dodd’s younger days as a partier and his history with women have also come into question during the process.Overall, this year’s vetting period has been cast with a sense of Democratic elders critiquing potential running mates for Biden with the same stereotypical criticisms men too often lob at women.Biden is reportedly now moving toward the final phase of his selection process. Jill Biden told Fox News on Tuesday that her husband was “close” to making a decision. An announcement is expected in the coming days.His selection has historic implications. Although two women have previously been nominated for vice-president, there has never been a female vice-president, and an African American woman has never been chosen as the running mate of a presidential nominee from a major US political party. If Biden wins, his pick will be poised as a frontrunner for the nomination for president in the future.Many Democratic women with extensive experience in party politics say the remarks, while not surprising, are deeply offensive and mar a vetting process that they hoped would be celebrated for its ersity.LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said she has been “appalled” by the “racist, sexist tropes” used by party leaders and elected officials to undermine female candidates for vice-president, particularly woman of color.“Being a Black woman with ambition is not a problem when it’s in the service of others,” Brown said, adding: “Black women have always been on the vanguard of fighting for our democracy, and we will continue to do so. But we will also hold accountable anyone who seeks to marginalize our contributions, our intellect or our electability. This is not going to be tolerated.”The best way for Biden to show he condemns these remarks, she said, would be to put a Black woman on the ticket.The comments have also exposed a generational ide between an old guard of white, mostly male leaders and a new cohort of erse, trailblazing women who are increasingly ascendent in the party. “A new generation has arrived. It’s really interesting this cycle where there’s such an energy and new talent. And I think there’s quite a few past political folks who are trying to find their place in this new political leadership,” said Amanda Renteria, the political director of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign.Renteria added: “They’re just not constructive from a party perspective. But you ask any of those women who have been in an arena. They’re well prepared for that kind of treatment, because they’ve been experiencing it their entire life.”Throughout Biden’s search there has been familiar scrutiny of potential running mates, such as past comments the California congresswoman Karen Bass has made in praise of Scientology.Still, Bass has emphasized that she does not “envision” herself as president, which some viewed as an effort to draw a contrast with Harris. The congresswoman pushed back on the narrative, saying she refuses to be pitted against Harris or any other woman in contention for the vice presidency.“Don’t call me the anti-Kamala,” she said during an interview with The Breakfast Club on Friday.Bass and Harris spoke privately at the memorial service for the congressman John Lewis in Washington last week. “It was good,” Bass said of their conversation. “She said ‘We ain’t doing that.’ It was fine.”Then there are the observations and critiques that do not usually emerge when men are being vetted, and that are familiar to women in the workplace from the boardroom to the factory floor.“You’re going to get that. That’s Ed. He has not changed. So you’re going to get those kinds of comments from him,” said Susan Turnbull, a former Maryland Democratic Party chairwoman and former Democratic National Committee vice-chair. “I think that women in particular are looking at this right now, going: ‘Just stop it. Don’t we have something better to be talking about?’”“Am I shocked? No,” Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor, said. “Any woman who has been in office or run before has heard similar comments along the way. They weren’t helpful then, they aren’t helpful now.Though the jockeying has intensified in recent days, gender - and the enduring stereotypes of women and power - have shaped the process since the moment Biden eliminated half the population from contention.Early on, Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, was chided for publicly campaigning for the role of vice-president. “I would be an excellent running mate,” she told Elle Magazine, unapologetically making the case for her candidacy.The Biden campaign has largely declined to engage in the public backbiting. But following the comments about Harris’ ambition, campaign manager Jennifer O’Malley Dillon pushed back. “Ambitious women make history, change the world, and win,” she wrote on twitter.“There are a number of sharp, thoughtful, and, yes, ambitious women up to the task of working alongside him every day to win this race and unite our country,” she added in a fundraising email to supporters this week.Harris, too, responded during an appearance at the Black Girls Lead 2020 conference.“There will be a resistance to your ambition,” she said. “There will be people who say to you, ‘You are out of your lane.”There is a long history of disparaging women who seek political power as “too ambitious”. But many Democratic women have found the suggestion especially galling in light of Biden’s own rise to the vice-presidency.“The point of being VP is that you’re next in line to being president,” said Katherine Grainger, a partner at Civitas Public Affairs Group, and a co-founder of the women’s advocacy organization SuperMajority. “If we just look at Biden, he ran for president in 1988 and ran again in 2008 against Obama, and yet when he was chosen as the VP nobody said he was too ambitious to have that job.”When women run for office, they disrupt a “patriarchal order” that has helped preserve a male-dominated status quo, Grainger said. Yet she is hopeful that elevating a woman to the vice-presidency could help shatter some of the old stereotypes that continue to constrain female candidates, more than 100 years after women won the right to vote in the United States.“Women are constantly walking this tightrope of being the most qualified but also likable or tough pretty and strong but also team-oriented and compassionate,” she said. “What it creates is a structure where you never really see the authenticity of female candidates, because quite frankly they’re not allowed to be themselves.”For some, it shows how many sexist barriers still exist in American politics.“All over the world, we’ve seen countries elect female leaders and yet for the United States it is still a barrier,” said Donna Brazile, a former Democratic National Committee chair. “In this country it is still a hurdle for women candidates to be taken seriously, and to be treated as equals when it comes to their qualifications, their experience, and then knowledge of the issues and the political terrain.”Brazile said the vice-presidential nomination is an opportunity to break “two glass ceilings” for women and Black women.“I’m proud of the progress we’ve made but the progress has been slow,” she said. “We need to hurry history.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7adb02949e678faf3e290ddf5a2bc45d41e470/0_219_3279_1967/master/3279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=404a8d2ed88025daae868434fd3fd8f7","title":"global report france could lose control of covid 19 at any time","story":"Experts say Germany is already in second wave as UN warns of global education catastropheFrance’s top scientific body has said the country risks losing control of its Covid-19 outbreak and the head of the doctors’ union in Germany has said it is already facing a second wave, as the number of infections rises across Europe.The French government’s scientific council said a second wave was highly likely this autumn or winter, and that the situation was “under control, but precarious. We could at any moment tip into a scenario that is less under control.”Authorities in a number of regions have already started to tighten public hygiene rules. Mask are now mandatory outdoors in busy areas of cities including Lille, Nice and Biarritz, and the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is expected to push for a similar order in parts of the capital this week.The virus had “recently been circulating more actively, with an increased loss of distancing and barrier measures” since France emerged from its strict two-month lockdown in May, the scientific council said, and a return of the epidemic as soon as the summer could not be ruled out.The warning came as authorities seek to contain a sharp increase in fresh cases over the past fortnight, with 3,376 new infections confirmed in the last three days and the number of people being treated for the disease in ICUs starting to inch higher.Health ministry data shows the number of people in intensive care rose by 13 between Friday and Monday, ending a downward trend maintained since April. Twenty-nine new deaths were reported over the same period, taking France’s total to 30,294.The prime minister, Jean Castex, urged France on Monday “not to let down its guard”, and called on “every French person to remain very vigilant. The fight against the virus depends on the state, local communities, institutions – but also on each of us.”After strict lockdowns stemmed infection rates, the number of cases has begun to creep up in many European countries as curbs have been steadily eased to limit the damage to their economies and allow for a much-needed summer holiday season.Germany is already contending with a second wave of the virus and risks squandering its early success because people have been flouting social-distancing rules, according to Susanne Johna, the president of Marburger Bund, which represents the country’s doctors.“We are already in a second, shallow upswing,” she told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper on Tuesday, urging people to continue to respect distancing and hygiene rules and wear masks despite an understandable desire to return to full normality.The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose by 879 to 211,281, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reported on Tuesday, and the country’s death toll climbed by eight to 9,156. More than half of Germany’s almost 21,000 intensive care beds are free and hospitals are well prepared, Johna said.The main German teachers’ union also cautioned on Tuesday that the nation’s staggered return to school was a major risk. Schools were not prepared, it said, citing the fact that many classroom windows could not be opened for security reasons as one danger.In Denmark, where the government and parliament are due to begin discussing the fourth phase of reopening – including nightclubs – later this month, the state epidemiologist, Kare Molbak, said on Tuesday he could not recommend proceeding.“It is not something that I can recommend, from a healthcare perspective, that you go ahead with,” Molbak said, according to the media outlet Ingenioeren. The weekly number of people infected with Covid-19 in Denmark has also risen significantly in the past couple of weeks.The government is considering tighter restrictions, including the introduction of mandatory testing for all travellers returning to the country and a quarantine period for those coming from certain countries. Sittings of the upper and lower houses of parliament have been postponed by a week after a senator tested positive.Russia reported 5,159 new cases on Tuesday, pushing its total to 861,423, the fourth highest in the world. The official death toll rose by 144 in the past 24 hours to 14,351.Beyond Europe, Iran confirmed more than 2,700 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, its highest single-day count in more than a month as deaths and infections from the virus continued a rising trajectory since hitting a months-long low in May.The health ministry has reimposed a range of restrictions that have been lifted gradually since April and called for people who fail to wear masks – now mandatory in enclosed spaces – to be fined.Globally, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the coronavirus pandemic had led to the largest disruption of education in history, with schools closed in more than 160 countries in mid-July and more than a billion students affected.In a video message and 26-page policy briefing, Guterres said the world faced “a generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress, and exacerbate entrenched inequalities”.He called for schools to reopen once local transmission of the virus is under control. “The decisions that governments and partners take now will have lasting impact on hundreds of millions of young people and on the development prospects of countries for decades to come,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b3417f38b9f078f25d55e34f8ea347159397f2/0_206_2700_1619/master/2700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4351f17f5b0470c594bcddafd97da760","title":"ammonium nitrate what is the chemical blamed for blast in lebanese capital","story":"The deadly explosion in Beirut has been blamed on thousands of tonnes of the chemical used in fertilisers and explosivesThe likely cause of the huge blast in Beirut on Tuesday appears to have been the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate.Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, said 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded after lying unsecured in a warehouse for six years, tallying with reports that a ship carrying a similar quantity of the chemical had unloaded its cargo at the port in 2013. It remains unclear what caused the chemical to ignite.Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives.It is not explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire – and therefore making it much more intense, according to Gabriel da Silva, a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne.However, da Silva said, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. “You need extreme circumstances to set off an explosion,” he said.While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. “I think that’s what’s happened here,” said da Silva.While the chemicals in the air should dissipate fairly quickly, lingering pollutants can cause problems later, for example if they acidify rain.“If you look at the smoke that came from the blast it’s this kind of blood red colour. That’s because of the nitrogen oxide air pollutants in it,” he said.If the 2,700-tonne figure is accurate, that would make the ammonium nitrate explosion larger than the 1947 Texas City Disaster, when a consignment of 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate exploded, killing nearly 500 people. The blast created a 4.5-metre (15ft) tidal wave.The images coming out of Beirut are also horribly reminiscent of the destruction inflicted on the Chinese city of Tianjin by a 2015 warehouse disaster that killed more than 170 people and left hundreds injured.On the night of 12 August a series of cataclysmic detonations rocked an area of warehouses where large quantities of hazardous chemicals, also including sodium cyanide and potassium nitrate, were being stored, in some cases illegally.Chinese authorities later claimed the first explosion had been triggered when the summer heat caused a highly flammable compound called nitrocellulose to spontaneously ignite. Nearby stores of ammonium nitrate then caught fire and exploded in the major port city, which lies 110km (70 miles) south-east of the capital Beijing.Firefighters who rushed to the scene reportedly attempted to extinguish the initial blaze with water – only to inadvertently exacerbate the situation because of the presence of hazardous flammable chemicals. The majority of those killed were firefighters, including at least one teenager.Such was the force of the Tianjin explosions that they registered as small earthquakes.Then, as now, witnesses filmed apocalyptic, almost surreal footage showing the scale of the inferno."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8064b1f7bae138fce578e78e262cf7f0a3bea20f/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ef6cb34cba2090293409f08bd346b390","title":"beirut explosion lebanon tell us how you are affected","story":"If you have been affected by the events in Beirut you can share your experiences directly with our journalistsHospitals in the Lebanese capital of Beirut are buckling under the weight of casualties following an explosion in the city on Tuesday which killed at least 100 people and injured 4,000.More than 100 people remain missing, and many are feared to have been trapped under the rubble.

Employees at Sitel – one of the companies contracted to provide the service – said they were being given quizzes by team leaders to keep them occupied in the day and that prizes were even being offered to those making the highest number of calls to keep up morale. One contact tracer said that in one instance £50 was awarded to the highest ranking caller in each team, who was then put in a draw at the end of the month to win a TV.The details come amid growing frustration among local health officials about the national test-and-trace system, which was launched in May and was seen as vital to easing England out of lockdown. Run by the former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding, it involves more than 20,000 contact tracers, paid around £10 an hour, employed by private firms such as Serco.One contact tracer said they had made just a few calls in two months of work, two of which had been fake numbers. “I’ve heard of tracers claiming to be sat in the garden having a barbecue so that they can stay logged in and clock up the hours,” he added. “They aren’t alone – there’s hundreds, if not thousands, of similar stories.”Another agent said that they were sent daily icebreakers which included questions such as “what’s your favourite flower?”, and that they had to do pub quiz-style questions as a part of the team “to pass the time and keep people active”.He said: “It’s very juvenile, particularly when they treat us with extreme scepticism and negativity when calls aren’t coming in.”Data seen by the  provided by an employee at the company Intelling, hired through outsourcing firm Serco, appears to show the scale of inactivity among employees, with 471 agents making just 135 calls in two days – around 0.14 calls per agent per day. This figure includes calls to incorrect numbers, voicemails, or multiple calls made to the same inidual. One tracer working at the company said that one inidual had been called by tracers 20 times.Serco said they have no record of someone being contacted 20 times and that it was better to have too much capacity in terms of staff than too little.Another tracer for a company contracted through Serco said they had been working for two and a half months and made just four calls, with the last one over a month ago and two that went to voicemail. She said she had seen a spreadsheet showing around 15 calls a day were being made by a team of over 55 people. Some of her colleagues had still not made a single call, she said.“We could easily make 30 calls a day,” said a tracer at Intelling. “I’ve worked hundreds of hours and only made a handful of calls, and all of them have gone to voicemail.” has seen progress reports from another contract tracer working at Sitel, which showed his team was averaging around 10 cases per person over nine weeks. He said that he had done a handful of calls, of which only one had connected and that person had already been contacted.Contract tracers reported that phone calls that had taken place were not being logged properly on the system, due to a lack of training. They said this meant some people were getting called multiple times a day by agents.“From a personal perspective I am a medical student so public health initiatives like track and trace is something I care about and meant something to me,” said one tracer. “I understand the consequences of really good public health initiatives and this was an opportunity to do something powerful and make a huge difference.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “In just eight weeks NHS test and trace has tested over 2.6 million people for coronavirus and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive, in order to break the chain of transmission.“We have over 27,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work and anyone with symptoms should book a test.”When contacted for comment, Sitel merely sent a link to a webpage about the impact of the pandemic on its operations. Intelling did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e199a76a96f7986319e877787c0fb9","title":"i had to hide myself again young lgbt people on their life in uk lockdown","story":"Many of the more than 200 respondents to the ’s callout tell of homophobia, biphobia and transphobiaThe experiences of LGBTQ people across the UK during lockdown have been as erse as the community itself. Married and cohabiting older gay men and lesbians have mainly felt the pandemic has had no more impact on them than on their heterosexual peers. But for many of the more than 200 respondents to the ’s callout, the past few months have brought significant challenges, including weeks of homophobia, biphobia and transphobia, increased isolation and deteriorating mental health.Younger LGBTQ people reported that lockdown meant being confined with families who were unsupportive or hostile. Kate, a 24-year-old bisexual demi-girl, meaning she identifies as a woman but not completely, said moving from her flat in Glasgow back into her childhood home in Ayrshire had meant hiding her sexuality again. “Being with parents who disagree with my very existence, with no one else or nowhere else to go for refuge, was tough,” said the visual merchandiser and sculptor. “I had to hide myself again. If I wanted to read a queer book I had to make sure I had something to hide the cover. I had to watch queer movies behind closed doors and hoped no one walked in and gawked at the screen.”Many trans people said relatives did not respect their identities. One trans non-binary couple, Hester and Nik, who both use the pronouns theythem, spent lockdown with Hester’s parents in Suffolk, who they said “misgendered us both consistently”. Hester added: “My mum is pretty transphobic so we avoid a lot of topics, such as JK Rowling and gender-neutral toilets. It can feel invalidating, although we get on most of the time.”For a few respondents, lockdown pushed them to demand more acceptance from their families. Huz Hussein, 31, a gay software engineer from Manchester, who lived with his family before lockdown, said being around them constantly made him feel he had “no choice but to open more about who and what I am”. He said: “Even though I am out to my mum, dad, sisters and brother, I was fed up living two lives. I am not out to my extended family and people in the local mosque community. I told my mum I felt as though I was still living a lie and I can’t be me around those people.“She said, ‘go tell anyone you want and I will stand by you and support you. You are my son and I love you.’ I know my mum still struggles with the idea of me being gay but every day she understands it more. And all she really wants is for me to be happy.”Younger people, even those who were out to their parents, commonly said that going back to living with them had adversely affected their mental health. Daniel Norman, 24, a gay man from London, said his anxiety “progressively got worse” when he moved to his parents’ house in Surrey in March. “While I am out to my parents, I struggled to be away from my friends in London where I am more openly queer than I can be at home,” he said, adding that his isolation was compounded by staying in a village with no visible LGBTQ community.“It feels like the work that queer people have put into coming out, finding community, discovering themselves has been reversed and now we have to put parts of our queer selves away when we navigate our hometowns and parents’ homes. I have only started to feel part of a community of other queer people in the past year, and was really starting to discover a lot about myself. So it was incredibly destructive to suddenly have that taken away from me.”Norman, who was seeing a specialist LGBTQ counsellor before lockdown, was one of many respondents who expressed concerns about their mental health and the loss of access to dedicated support services. Jack Cullen, from Stepney Green, in east London, who works with LGBTQ venues such as the Glory in Haggerston, said he went to check on two friends in acute distress, one of whom talked about jumping off his balcony. Cullen drew a contrast between the lives of wealthy and privileged MPs who broke lockdown and his desire to support “a drag queen disowned by her family forced to sit in a windowless room for three months, except for a few laps around an estate where kids shout abuse at her”.Most trans respondents said their distress was compounded by medical treatment being cancelled, including gender confirmation surgery. Hester’s partner, Nik, 27, a queer trans student physiotherapist, said the cancellation of their top surgery (bilateral mastectomy) was devastating “having jumped through many hoops to get referred to a surgeon”.The loss of access to LGBTQ venues, such as pubs and clubs, events, such as Pride, and community services, such as youth groups and social networks, was another widespread concern. Many respondents feared the post-pandemic recession would lead to these businesses and services closing completely, as many were already in a precarious financial state.Bronagh, a lesbian who works in media tech in London, said: “Before Covid, I made it a point to go to LGBT+ theatre, bars. Since lockdown began, just seeing fewer non-heteronormative people in daily life definitely makes you feel more like an island.”Jamie Wake, 42, a social care bid manager from Reading, helped set up a weekly event called SaturGAY to replace the one regular LGBTQ club night in the town closed by the pandemic. “It was established to combat social isolation,” he said. “It’s a quiz night with phone-ins and entertainment. Reading is similar to other provincial towns in that several LGBT venues have closed in recent years. People underestimate the value of a local LGBT community. Dedicated safe spaces are good for mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89dcce825da98adc77f56607eab0a60132038626/0_8_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8680d9e05d3ee948dddaf4511b63973d","title":"meet david born in france raised in belgium facing removal to the drc","story":"He grew up in Brussels and dreams of a career in fashion, but hardline laws make him an asylum seeker in his own countryWhen David (not his real name) walked into the headquarters of the Belgian immigration department to apply for asylum, he looked at the other people in the queue and thought: “They don’t speak French, they had to flee their country, they have good reason for asking for protection. I’m going to be laughed at.” The officials at the reception desk did not laugh, but they did give him “a weird look”, David says. “When they heard my accent and saw my dyed blond hair, they seemed to think: ‘What are you doing here?’”David recounts that day last year with a flawless Bruxellois accent. Born on the outskirts of Paris to parents of Congolese descent, he arrived in Belgium when still a toddler. We meet close to where he lives, in Brussels’ university district. His outfit – black ripped skinny jeans, black polo shirt and two white wireless earbuds – is carefully chosen: David, now 22, is set on a career in fashion.In the same month he applied for asylum, January 2019, Belgium received 2,765 applications, mainly from Palestinians, Afghans and Syrians. Why does David, who grew up in Brussels and has never set foot outside the EU, have to seek international protection in what he feels is his home country? Because he is at serious risk of being deported to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country his parents left when they were children, following their own refugee parents.David’s mother was 17 when he was born. She soon separated from David’s father, who did not recognise David as his son. A few years later she left France for Brussels. The young, single mother entrusted her son to his paternal grandmother. “My mother wanted to live her life, my father was in jail by then,” David says. “But I had a happy childhood. I had a lot of cousins, uncles and aunts, I had my friends in school. I didn’t know anything about my immigration issues.”Estimates suggest between 100,000 and 150,000 undocumented people live in Belgium. No one seems to know how many of them are children, growing up with limited rights. “They have the right to education,” says Melanie Zonderman from the Platform for Minors in Exile, a network for migrant children’s rights, “and, like undocumented adults, the right to emergency medical services.” That is it.In Belgium, as in other European countries, the paths to legal status are confusing and difficult to navigate, let alone for a child. They can apply for a humanitarian permit to stay in Belgium under article 9bis of the Belgian aliens act, but whether this is granted or not depends on opaque criteria, which the Belgian immigration department does not make public. The process can take years, costs €358 (£325) for adults (it is free for children), and in the meantime children are at risk of deportation.David’s situation was complex. His best option seemed to be “family reunification” with a parent living legally in the country. But his mother, who suffered from mental illness and addiction, had not kept up her residence permit. His father, who was released from prison when David was about 10 years old, still had not recognised him as his son.With David’s 18th birthday approaching, his father finally agreed to a DNA paternity test. When he was 16, David received a five-year permit based on “reunification” with his father. Two years later, he was told there had been a mistake: as the child of a refugee, not a Belgian citizen, he was only eligible for a renewable one-year permit, which would become permanent after five years. David felt the blow, but told himself he just had to hold on for a few more years.Then he did something that blew it all: he came out. “When my father got out of prison, he soon realised I was not the son he would have wanted,” David said. “I have always been effeminate. He started making comments: ‘Why is he like this, why does he dance like a girl?’ And I thought: ‘I don’t even know you, and you want to change me … I don’t like this.’” During his adolescence David felt as if he had a split personality: “At school I was extrovert, sociable and good-humoured, while at home I was silent, almost embittered.”One day in January 2018, “I was fighting over the phone with my dad, and I just threw it in his face: ‘By the way, I’m gay!’ He hung up. I started packing my things.” In the following months, David felt relieved. “I started wearing makeup at school,” he says. But then October came, and he had to renew his residence permit. Among the criteria was that David’s father lived with his son and had a stable income. “When the official at the city council asked me for my father’s payslip, I realised my situation,” he says. “I told him I wasn’t even talking to my father.” David became undocumented, again.He tried applying for a permit under article 9bis, but his pro bono lawyer turned out to be not so pro bono: “He kept asking me for money.” The lack of transparent criteria also made this route risky. He went to France, his country of birth, to see if he could get papers there, but he was not eligible under French nationality laws.Until recently, a lot of families with children were rejected for asylum, says Selma Benkhelifa, a lawyer and activist from the Progress Lawyers Network. “The minors weren’t even mentioned in these decisions. They were literally treated like part of their parents’ luggage.” So lawyers started filing separate asylum requests for the children, arguing that reintegrating in countries they barely knew, after spending their childhood or adolescence in Belgium, would not only be impossible but would expose them to serious risks.On Benkhelifa’s advice, David decided to apply for asylum, based on the persecution he would face in the DRC because of his sexuality. Robin Bronlet, a colleague of Benkhelifa’s, is optimistic about David’s case. But he points out the absurdity of the rule by which children inherit the nationality of their parents. “As immigration lawyers, we must identify the risks David would be facing in case of ‘return’ to his ‘country of origin’, meaning the DRC,” he says, “even though David was born in Europe and never set foot in Africa.”Today, undocumented children are scattered all over Belgium. Some of them make the news when they suddenly disappear from school, are detained and sometimes deported. But most, like David, keep their worries to themselves and blend in with their classmates, hoping for some miraculous solution.None of David’s closest friends from school know he has lost his residence permit and has applied for asylum. “If I told them, they would worry, and it would be too stressful,” he says, “and I don’t want to be pitied.” Since leaving his grandmother’s house, David has moved around a lot. He stayed with friends and even spent a few nights in a hotel when had nowhere else to go. In September 2019, he moved into a flat with three other gay asylum seekers through Le Refuge, an organisation supporting isolated LGBTQI+ youth.At the end of 2019, David’s mother was arrested after an identity check and taken to Belgium’s only immigration detention centre for women, in Holsbeek. While he remains estranged from his father and grandmother, his mother has accepted his sexuality. She spent six months in detention before the coronavirus outbreak forced Belgian authorities to release many immigration detainees. David visited her several times. “To me, it was an extension of what I had gone through since entering the asylum system,” he says. “The human side is totally lacking. All they see in you is a sans-papiers.”David is eagerly awaiting his interview with asylum authorities. “I’m really sick of waiting. I feel stuck,” he says. And yet he is making plans for his future. He wants to start a YouTube channel offering advice on makeup, fashion, wigs and how to “boost the confidence of LGBT young people”. He wants to find a job to save money and enrol in fashion school. “Will the asylum authorities believe me?” he wonders. “I will tell them my truth. If it’s not enough, too bad. If it’s enough, so much the better. I just want to get it over with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55488fda70f94a18279440fcdb95cc47776e4243/0_180_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f91135c22e850ffb2ed2d017b27a2ac4","title":"realised dream italy oldest graduate top of the class at 96","story":"Giuseppe Paternò was awarded first-class honours in philosophy from the University of PalermoGiuseppe Paternò set his sights on obtaining a university education as a child growing up in Sicily in the 1930s. Poverty, war and supporting a family got in the way. Now, at 96, he has achieved his goal, becoming Italy’s oldest graduate in the process.“I’ve finally realised my dream,” the former railway worker and second world war veteran said this week, after graduating with a degree in philosophy from the University of Palermo.“Being able to study has always been my greatest aspiration, but my family wasn’t able to pay for my education. We were a large family and very poor.”Paternò, the eldest of seven siblings, started working as a child, when he helped his father with his job at a brewery in Palermo. In July 1943, when the allied forces landed in Sicily, Paternò was working as a telegrapher for the Italian army in Trapani.“I came out unscathed from the war and took a job working for the state railway service. I wasn’t enthused about my job, but I knew I had to do it because by that time I was married and had a family to support. At the same time, I had an overwhelming desire to e into books and read, study and learn.”At the age of 31, after attending evening classes, Paternò graduated from high school as a surveyor. “During the day, I’d work. In the evening I’d attend school, and at night I’d study,” he said. But his dream of earning a university degree remained elusive.Eventually, in 2017, Paternò enrolled in the department of philosophy at the University of Palermo.“I’d wake up at seven to study,” he said. “I’d use an old typewriter to complete my assignments. I’d rest in the afternoon and in the evening I’d study until midnight. My neighbours used to ask, ‘why all this trouble at your age?’ But they couldn’t understand the importance of reaching a dream, regardless of my age.”With a few exams left, the Covid-19 pandemic risked stalling his graduation. When courses transitioned to remote learning platforms, Paternò was obliged to come to terms with the new technology.“When the pandemic arrived, we started to fear for his health,” said Ninni Paternò, Giuseppe’s son. “I told my father that we could postpone exams and that he could go back to classes in the autumn. But he said no. He said that, given his advanced age, he feared he wouldn’t make it through the summer.”Paternò’s dream came to fruition last Friday, when he graduated first in his class with top honours. “It’s one of the happiest days of my entire life,” he said. “I only wish my wife were here to see me. She died 14 years ago.”Has Paternò stopped dreaming? On the contrary. “I’m considering carrying on for a master’s degree. My mother lived to be 100. If the numbers and the genetics are on my side, then I still have four years left.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e866f04bd8707a1d18bb3391f0f39c4c14bea98/0_208_3480_2089/master/3480.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9de3792c531e51e25cc810f3dd3faf1d","title":"beirut explosion in pictures","story":"An explosion has rocked central Beirut in Lebanon, shattering windows and shaking buildings for several hundred feet.

The money will be ided equally between the UN World Food Programme and the Red Cross.Foreign minister Marise Payne said in the statement announcing the aid that the Australian embassy in Beirut had been damaged significantly by the explosions, with some staff receiving injuries.Our correspondent in Moscow, Andrew Roth, has some gripping details on the ship that brought the ammonium nitrate to Beirut:Little is known about the Russian owner of the Rhosus, the cargo ship impounded in Beirut in 2014, whose captain had referred to its freight of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate fertiliser as a “floating bomb”. That ammonium nitrate is believed to have fuelled the devastating explosion that has left more than 100 dead in Beirut.Former crew members said the ship was owned by Igor Grechushkin, a Russian national believed to be living in Cyprus, where he holds either citizenship or residency. Grechushkin, a native of the far-eastern city of Khabarovsk, is reported to have managed Teto Shipping, which owned the Rhosus. The ship arrived in Beirut in 2013 while sailing from Georgia to Mozambique. It was prevented from leaving the Beirut port in 2014 over an unspecified dispute, either because the ship was deemed not seaworthy or because the owner had failed to pay the necessary fees to the port. It was then that Grechushkin is said to have walked away from the ship, refusing to answer calls or negotiate with the port authorities for the release of his sailors.A deleted LinkedIn profile lists Grechushkin as living in Cyprus and as working as a manager at Unimar Service Ltd. Calls to a company with a similar name and profile, Unimar Safety Services and Equipment, on Wednesday were not answered. Calls to a number for Grechushkin listed by the aggrieved crew members also went unanswered.The letter, which was sent to Russian journalists by the Rhosus’s former captain in 2014, also complained about being “held hostage” onboard the ship. The Beirut authorities “don’t want an abandoned ship at port, especially with a cargo of explosives, which is what ammonium nitrate is. That is, this is a floating bomb, and the crew is a hostage aboard this bomb.”The mostly Ukrainian crew were held onboard the ship for nearly a year before they were released. The ammonium nitrate was confiscated and held at the port in a warehouse.The Russian television station Ren TV published a photograph on Wednesday of a man it said was Grechushkin in tight-fitting jeans and sunglasses sitting astride a motorcycle. The television station did not indicate the source of the photograph. From my colleague, Emma:Amid the horror, there was also incredible humanity on display, with the wounded recounting how they were helped to hospitals by complete strangers, and those whose homes survived offering hundreds of thousands of estimated homeless a place to stay.Videos shared on social media also showed parents and carers trying to physically shelter small children from the blast with their bodies.New York Times reporter Vivian Yee was injured in the blast, but managed to write a powerful account of the hours that followed. She staggered bleeding into the street where a man passing on a motorbike offered to take her to hospital. It was full, but another stranger bandaged her worst wound, and a third helped clean the others.“The Lebanese who would help me in the hours to come had the heartbreaking steadiness that comes from having lived through countless previous disasters. Nearly all of them were strangers, yet they treated me like a friend,” she wrote.The European Union is activating its civil protection system to round up emergency workers and equipment from across the 27-nation bloc to help Beirut, according to the Associated Press.The EU commission says the plan is to urgently dispatch over 100 firefighters with vehicles, sniffer dogs and equipment designed to find people trapped in urban areas. The Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Poland and the Netherlands are taking part and others are expected to join.The EU’s satellite mapping system will help Lebanese authorities to establish the extent of the damage. Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic says the EU “shares the shock and sadness” of Beirut residents and stands ready to provide extra help.Reuters is quoting the economy minister, Raoul Nehme, as saying the nation has less than a month’s reserves of the grain but still with enough flour to avoid a crisis. the economy minister said on Wednesday.Minister of Public Works Michel Najjar has said the country will now use the northern city of Tripoli as Lebanon’s main shipping port. It is currently operating at less than half of its total capacity.This video, which we have not verified, is being shared on Twitter. It is said to be of a protester attacking the car of the former Lebanese prime minister, Saad Hariri, earlier today.Hariri resigned last year following mass protests demanding an end to rampant corruption and mismanagement of the country. Tuesday’s blast has compounded anger from Lebanese people focused on the ruling classes.The location is the site of the grave of Hariri’s late father, Rafik, who was killed by a truck bomb 15 years ago.The French presidency has just confirmed that Emmanuel Macron will travel to Beirut tomorrow (Thursday).Pallets of aid are being loaded in Dubai to be flown to Beirut:Separately, Germany said it is ready to send a team of 47 search-and-rescue experts. The country’s embassy was damaged in the blast.France, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait are also shipping supplies. French emergency workers include members of a special unit with chemical training to intervene in damaged industrial sites.Here is another Instagram account set up to help. This one is filled with posts from people around Lebanon who are offering up their homes and businesses for people to stay.It seems to be anything from studio apartments to empty schools to entire hotels.Bangladesh’s military has said at least 21 Bangladesh navy members of the multinational United Nations force in Beirut were injured. One of the injured is in critical condition and had been admitted to the American University of Beirut Medical Center, according to the Associated Press.Meanwhile, Italy’s defence minister, Lorenzo Guerini, said one soldier assigned to the country’s contingent in Lebanon is injured. The UN operates peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, as well as units to prevent the movement of illegal arms.The first satellite image of the crater:The tweeter says the image is from the company, Planet.An Instagram account has been set up to locate people who went missing in Beirut.The account is also posting lists of people admitted to various hospitals in the city, to help people find their loved ones.Hello, Oliver Holmes here again, taking over from Rebecca.AFP is quoting the governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, as saying the damage from the port blast has extended over half of the city, with the cost of damage likely above $3bn.He has also upped his previous estimate of the number of “homeless” to 300,000, which is close to the total population of the central part of the capital. Again, we are not sure if he is talking about homelessness or people whose homes have been damaged.MTV says that a team of its journalists have been arrested while out reporting on the aftermath of yesterday’s explosion. Lebanon is considered one of the more liberal media environments in the region, though reporters have warned that the space for the free press is shrinking."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Energy companies bid against each other for contracts of 16.5 years to provide serviceThe combination of sea-level rise, storm surges and high tides could expose an extra 23 million people to coastal flooding by 2050In throwing out State\u0026rsquos Climate Mitigation Plan, judges have done a real service to Irish democracy"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Inidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping change"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Publicans had hoped they would be able to reopen on August 10th. Photograph: Collins Public health expert Dr Gabriel Scally has said that alcohol is the “best friend” of the coronavirus and the only safe option was to keep those pubs not serving food closed.Dr Scally drew a clear distinction between pubs that only serve alcohol and those that also serve food.“They are like chalk and cheese. I’ve never had to shoulder my way to the counter to get a drink in a restaurant.”NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm.Speaking on RTÉ Radio One’s Today with Sarah McInerney Show, Dr Scally pointed to Scotland where pubs had reopened and 32 people were infected with Covid-19 having all been in one pub.He said keeping the virus under control was not good enough, and said the aim should be to have zero cases. Keeping the pubs closed was the way to do that.A “zero Covid” strategy would require co-operation North and South, no domestic cases, and putting controls in place to ensure no cases were imported, he said.When asked about Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s proposed Four Nations Elimination Strategy, Dr Scally said he admired her and the plan but said he was pessimistic about the response from Whitehall.Dr Scally was speaking following a Cabinet decision on Tuesday evening to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks.Pubs which do not serve food and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least, and the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place.Face masks are set to become mandatory in all shops and retail centres from Monday, and pubs serving food and restaurants will be required to close at 11pm.Separately, the Cabinet also decided to remove five states or territories from the “green list” of 15 from which passengers arriving into Ireland would not need to quarantine. They are Malta, Cyprus, San Marino, Gibraltar and Monaco.Earlier, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said while he was disappointed the restrictions were not being eased the decisions were made with the safety of citizens in mind.Mr Donnelly said the Government had to take a cautious approach to lifting coronavirus restrictions and said keeping people safe, opening schools and restarting the economy was the priority.He said the Government would look closely at the possibility of having regional or county decisions in the future. The concern, the Minister told Morning Ireland, was that things were finely balanced and could get out of control.Ireland is in a dynamic situation and the Government must respond dynamically, said Mr Donnelly.Meanwhile Independent TD Michael Healy-Rae said the Government was treating publicans and their customers with contempt and he claimed reopening pubs would protect the public’s health.The dangers that might arise in bigger pubs could not be compared with smaller rural pubs where there might be just six or seven customers, he said.The decision to retrench the current phase of lockdown came after a further 45 confirmed cases was confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.Mr Martin justified the decision in light of recent coronavirus figures which have seen the 14-day incidence of cases triple in the last month.“I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know that I have enormous sympathy for their plight,” said Mr Martin.“This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living.”He said: “International evidence shows very clearly that pubs and nightclubs reopening too early leads directly and inextricably to increased community transmission.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus. “The truth is the pandemic is blazing around the world. In fact it is worse than ever,” he said.In a joint statement on Tuesday, the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA) and the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) said publicans were now in “fury and despair”, and called for “immediate” aid.“This is Groundhog Day for the trade as twice now the reopening of pubs has been postponed,” said VFI chief executive Pádraig Cribben. “The Government has effectively denied pubs the ability to trade. As a result it will have to provide substantial supports to our members, many of whom are deeply agitated at what they feel is the State abandoning a vital part of the hospitality sector.”Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the LVA, said pubs have been abandoned: “We’re repeatedly being told that opening the pubs ‘could lead to an increase in the virus’. Well, when will that not be the case?”The 25,000 people working in pubs now faced “intolerable pressure”, said the bodies, who complained about a lack of guidance from the Government or reassurance about the future."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Differences between pubs serving food and those that don\u0026rsquot are \u0026lsquolike chalk and cheese\u0026rsquoMajor new study on Irish reciism rates released by Central Statistics Office (CSO)\u0026lsquoEven in the darkest moments, when people would have been forgiven for having no hope, John made peace visible for others\u0026rsquoDPP directs pair be tried on indictment by judge and jury at circuit court level, court hearsUnsilencing Black Voices project seeks to educate people about racism in IrelandPublic health experts call for \u0026lsquoall measures\u0026rsquo to be utilised to discourage travel from overseasThose arrested in Fermanagh, Belfast and Derry are aged between 63 and 78Celebrity clothes auction aims to fill shortfall in Jack and Jill Foundation fundraisingWidower John McAreavey questions the timing of the latest probe into his wife\u0026rsquos deathTaoiseach sympathises with publicans as phase four of reopening further delayedIrish tourists helping to compensate for loss of visitors from overseas to Co Kerry townDetails on Dublin-Derry train line sought as part of recent government formation talksGAA president urges patience and says games will continue to be playedVintner groups say the 25,000 people working in pubs now under \u0026lsquointolerable pressure\u0026rsquoDrug produced more antibodies after two doses than those in recovered coronavirus patientsNobel Laureate brought from Donegal ahead of funeral in St Eugene\u0026rsquos CathedralCourt approves \u0026euro20,000 settlement after boy was accused of stealing from teachersMoving to Phase Four of reopening society deferred due to the trend in coronavirus casesNumber receiving payment falls by 12,300 in past week, down 54 per cent from peakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4320052.1596381987!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup s brexit ads who bankrolled the secretive 435 000 campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Geoghegan contends that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign. Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

In a letter to Government, the National Public Health Emergency Team said it had previously recommended mandatory quarantine for all passengers travelling to Ireland from overseas. “While this remains NPHET’s preferred recommendation, if this is deemed unworkable or disproportionate, the NPHET again recommends that consideration is given to the introduction of a travel ban on non-essential travel for those countries with particularly high incidence rates.” The team said 7.8 per cent of cases notified over the last fortnight are associated with travel. They recommended in their letter that “all measures be utilised to discourage travel from overseas to Ireland at this time.” The team also warned the Government that “behavioural and message fatigue” is a risk “as the population disengages from Covid-19-related news.”Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly was also warned about the increased risk of community transmission.“Ireland is no different to other countries and there remains a continuing and heightened risk that the already evident increase in cases could potentially lead to increasing levels of community transmission in the coming weeks.” NPHET recommended a closing time of 10.30pm for the restaurant and cafe sector except for take-out and delivery and the mandatory wearing of masks for staff. The Government opted instead to implement a closing time of 11pm. NPHET said that while the vast majority of restaurants and gastropubs had adhered to guidelines, there should be “continued robust inspection and enforcement arrangements and the enhancement of these arrangements where necessary.” The team said pubs and bars “pose a particular risk to the spread of Covid 19 as alcohol can make people less aware of social distancing and hygiene and respiratory behaviours, loud atmospheres can increase particles emitted and many pubs and bars can be small spaces with poor ventilation.” A paper was given to the team which detailed international evidence of outbreaks associated with pubs. NPHET said it had “significant and growing concerns” around the increasing case numbers reported each day and incidence of the disease nationally. The public health team also had concerns about the increasing number of cases in vulnerable groups, workplaces and increased levels of cases in younger people and in particular those aged between 25 to 34 years. There was also an “observed shift” in the location of the majority of cases from the greater Dublin region to other counties over the past seven to ten days. “The majority of cases are no longer predominantly limited to the greater Dublin region.” The positivity rate for all tests processed nationally in the last week was 0.7 per cent which had increased over the previous week. The NPHET said that 47 new cases and four new clusters were notified in the last week in relation to direct provision centres. There were also ten Covid 19 outbreaks involving the Irish traveller community, involving 89 cases Four outbreaks open in meat processing plants have also been associated with 94 cases. Some 49 per cent of all cases have occurred from “close contact with a confirmed case”. “The proportion of cases that are noted as being attributable to community transmission appears to be stable.” The team said it was critically important that there be low levels of community transmission in order to protect vulnerable people, open schools and resume healthcare.

But the Coalition decided to delay the already-paused opening up of society for a further three weeks. Photograph: Tom HonanThe Pubs that do not serve food and nightclubs will remain closed until September at least, the Cabinet has decided, in a significant tightening of societal restrictions to curb the recent increase of Covid-19 cases in Ireland.In a blow to the licensing industry, the Government yesterday decided to delay the already-paused phase four of reopening society for a further three weeks.Besides pubs remaining shut until at least September 1st, the current strict limits of 50 on numbers congregating indoors, and 200 outdoors, will remain in place, a move that disappointed many sporting bodies and wedding venues. The numbers had been due to increase to 100 indoors and 500 outdoors.In a press conference following the Government meeting, Taoiseach Micheál Martin also announced face masks will become mandatory in all shops and retail centres from Monday, and pubs serving food and restaurants will be required to close at 11pm.Separately, the Cabinet also decided to remove five states or territories from the “green list” of 15 from which passengers arriving into Ireland would not need to quarantine. They are Malta, Cyprus, San Marino, Gibraltar and Monaco.The decision to keep all restrictions in place came as a surprise.Increase in casesMr Martin justified the decision in light of recent coronavirus figures which have seen the 14-day incidence of cases triple in the last month.“I know that this will come as a blow to pub owners and I want them to know that I have enormous sympathy for their plight.“This virus is taking away their ability to earn a living.”He continued: “International evidence shows very clearly that pubs and nightclubs reopening too early leads directly and inextricably to increased community transmission. \u0026nbsp“And that is the very worst thing that could happen here. It would be very damaging for our economy in the longer term, it would be very damaging for our plan to reopen schools safely and it would of course be very damaging for our public health.”Vintners’ representatives responded angrily to the decision saying the Government had abandoned the 3,500 smaller pubs across Ireland now facing a “full-blown crisis”.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said Ireland had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus. “The truth is the pandemic is blazing around the world. In fact it is worse than ever,” he said.“Even in Europe the number of new cases is rising again,” he said, though he said it was largely under control in the EU.The decision to retrench the current phase of lockdown came after a further 45 confirmed cases was confirmed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Tuesday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the average number of cases had increased in 14 of the 15 “green list” territories and countries over the past two weeks.Ireland had moved from 20 new cases to 53 new cases per day. Two weeks ago there were 120 new cases, last week 284, he said.“NPHET’s view is the situation is ‘finely balanced’ and it would not take much for these cases and new clusters to spill into community transmission,” said Mr Donnelly.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"China says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state mediaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4322739.1596634333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to send highest level official to taiwan in four decades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS health secretary Alex Azar speaking in the Rose Garden of the White House on May 15th as Donald Trump looks on. Photograph: Mandel NganAFP via Getty ImagesThe US is sending the highest level cabinet official to Taiwan since cutting diplomatic ties with Taipei 41 years ago, reflecting rising support for the country in Washington in the face of growing Chinese aggression.US health secretary Alex Azar will lead a delegation to Taipei “in the coming days”, he wrote on Twitter, in the midst of a push by the Trump administration to adopt a tougher approach to China. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened to invade if Taipei refuses to come under China’s control indefinitely.“Beijing will no doubt be very displeased but it has devalued the currency of its anger to an extent in 2020 through overuse,” said Mark Harrison, a Taiwan expert at the University of Tasmania. “Beijing may well understand the visit in the context of the uncertain election outcome in the US in November and will no doubt be looking towards 2021 in any responses it makes.”Washington has made efforts to deepen its contacts with Taiwan in recent years against a backdrop of rising tensions with Beijing. Congress has encouraged US officials to meet members of the Taiwanese government and help Taipei strengthen international ties and participation in global organisations.The marked shift of tone led to president Tsai Ing-wen being allowed to give a speech at Columbia University in 2019 and vice-president William Lai to visit Washington this year, the first visit to the US capital by a high-level Taiwanese politician since 1979.“Sending health and human services secretary Alex Azar to Taiwan at this time is a logical next step for the Trump administration,” said Gerrit van der Wees, a former Dutch diplomat who teaches Taiwan history at George Mason University. “Azar was in the forefront of the effort to get Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly in Geneva in May 2020, and US foreign policy officials have repeatedly lauded Taiwan for the way it handled the coronavirus crisis.”‘Model of transparency’Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs, told reporters on Wednesday efforts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei were “doomed to fail”.“China firmly opposes the official communication between the US and Taiwan,” he added.Mr Azar praised Taiwan as “a model of transparency and co-operation in global health during the Covid-19 pandemic and long before it”. He added that he would “convey President Trump’s support for Taiwan’s global health leadership and underscoring our shared belief that free and democratic societies are the best model for protecting and promoting health”.Washington’s support for Taiwan has been driven by senior officials in the White House, the state department and the Pentagon and won bipartisan support in Congress.Mr Trump took a congratulatory call from Ms Tsai after his election as president in 2016, a move that sparked Chinese outrage. But he has showed little inclination since then to support Taiwan for the sake of democratic values.According to the book by John Bolton, Mr Trump’s former national security adviser, the president described the significance of Taiwan by comparing it to the tip of his pen and then comparing China to his Oval Office desk. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321862.1596554372!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"citizens in brexit britain clamour for german passports study shows","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn anti-Brexit demonstrator waves a Union flag alongside an EU flag outside the Houses of Parliament in London in 2018. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty Images Britons have rushed for the exits of Brexit Britain, a new study suggests, sparking a brain drain on a scale last seen during the 2004 EU accession of central and eastern European countries – but in the opposite direction. The joint research report, by Berlin’s Social Science Centre and the University of Oxford’s new Berlin outpost, shows that post-Brexit immigrants in Germany are prepared to accept higher risk and even lower pay and conditions to start a new life outside the UK.Outward migration from the UK to EU neighbours has jumped 30 per cent in the last four years, to around 17,000 people annually, with about half attributable to what researchers term the “collective uncertainty” Brexit vote.That uncertainty is visible, too, in naturalisation applications. Compared with pre-Brexit figures, UK citizen applications for another EU passport have jumped 500 per cent – and 2,000 per cent for Germany.“We’re observing a new social migration phenomena and a redefining of what it means to be British-European,” said Daniel Tetlow, a co-author of the study. “In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians.”During the same period migration among other EU member states showed no comparable spikes and, in many cases, stagnated.As well as migration data, researchers Daniel Tetlow and Dr Daniel Auer conducted 46 qualitative, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with British migrants across Germany – a popular destination for a erse cohort of UK emigrants in the last decades.The interviews, covering arrivals from 2007 to 2019, showed a clear ide between pre- and post-Brexit arrivals. Two-thirds of the latter group were prepared to accept a pay cut, or a pay freeze as part of their UK escape plan. They were also significantly greater risk-takers than earlier arrivals: a 40-something male IT consultant said he was still hunting for work in Germany but that “the advantages still outweigh the uncertainty that Brexit brought on my family”.Brexit pushA third of the post-Brexit arrivals conceded they would not have moved had the UK voted to remain in the EU in June 2016. Within 12 weeks of that vote, half of them had departed the UK, compared to the 12 months a majority of pre-Brexit arrivals spent planning their move.“The referendum happened in 2016 – and we immediately changed our minds about buying a house in Bristol,” said one interviewee, a 40-something male academic. “Our whole emigration decision hung on the referendum result.”One-third of the recent group said Brexit had caused direct mental health problems or depression and, in what researchers called an “irony” of Brexit, new arrivals expressed a greater determination to integrate into German society, in particular by learning German, than in the past.A 30-something female translator who arrived in 2015 said, in her subjective experience, many UK citizens in Germany “do not recognise Britain any longer, and feel ashamed to call themselves British, drawing instead on regional and local identities like Scottish, Welsh, Lancastrian, from Yorkshire.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The businesses need the customers but we would just like a bit of respect back for the town that they claim to love,” town mayor Nikki Turnton said. Farmers from the Lake District to North Wales have reported cases of amateur ‘wild campers’ leaving festival-style mess in the middle of fields, abandoned tents on the side of mountains, and lighting open campfires in irresponsible places. Instagram influencers are driving a huge interest in wild camping in the UK this summer, experts say, as people have been “penned down” for months and want to create the “authentic experience” they see on social media now more than ever.But with the increased crowds come increasing amounts of litter - so much so that the term ‘wild camping’ has recently become synominsed to ‘dirty camping’ in the outdoor industry. Mountain rescue teams are also struggling with the increasing number of Britons swapping Lake Como in Italy for the Lake District this summer. Richard Warren, chairman of the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, said the “tidal wave” of lost and injured staycationers is pushing them to breaking point. Of the 19 call outs they have handled since Friday, 11 were “truly avoidable”. Meanwhile, police in Aberystwyth, West Wales, warned against the fashionable wild swimming trend after a nine-year-old boy and his mother were swept away in a river. The pair survived the incident, but the coastguard said the rescue was like a scene from Apocalypse Now and urged inexperienced swimmers not to try swimming in open water to make up for pools being closed. Julian Glover, who wrote an independent review for the Government on England’s national parks last year, called for more education on how to respect the UK’s rural areas. “It is a good thing that people want to come out of towns to walk and enjoy the landscape. We should support that. We can’t close the countryside off. But in return we need to make sure that the people who come protect what is special about those places,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis italy worlds coronavirus pariah avoided second wave","story":"Just a few months ago, Italy was an international pariah, a nation which the rest of the world regarded with a mixture of pity and terror.At the height of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 900 people died in a day and one city in the north – Bergamo –was so overwhelmed with dead bodies that the army had to be drafted in to take away coffins in a convoy of trucks.Thankfully, those days seem like a distant nightmare and the tables are turned. Now it is the Italians who regard the likes of the US and Brazil with anguish and sympathy.Italy has avoided the kind of second wave – or prolongation of the first wave – that has caused such concern in other countries, including Spain, France and Germany.For the past few weeks, Italy has registered around 150-300 new cases each day, many of them imported by migrants or workers returning from abroad.Deaths are down to single digits each day, a dramatic reduction from the dark days of March and April.On Monday, there were just 159 new cases and 12 deaths, while on Tuesday there were 190 new cases and five deaths. The country’s death toll is just over 35,000.Consensus is emerging as to how the Italians managed to control – the word defeat is far too premature – a virus that went onto ravage so many other countries.There were two key factors: a strict nationwide lockdown which prevented the virus from spreading from badly-affected northern regions to the rest of the country and the rigid enforcement of health protocols such as the wearing of face masks and social distancing.The lockdown, imposed in early March, averted the diffusion of the virus to the dysfunctional south of Italy, where underfunded hospitals lack the resources of those in the wealthy north.  Experts said this would have been a catastrophe. The lockdown was tough, interminable and yet largely respected. For weeks, Italians were not allowed out of their homes unless they had unavoidable work commitments, had to shop for food or buy medicine.Police cars patrolled the streets, relaying messages through megaphones ordering people to stay at home.People caught riding their bikes for pleasure rather than to get to work were heavily fined passengers on buses who did not wear masks were promptly kicked off by the drivers.Italy had one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, according to the Government Response Stringency Index, which compares the measures taken by nations around the world to combat the virus.All of this came at a heavy price – Italy’s GDP is predicted to drop by at least 10 per cent this year as a result of the closure of industry and businesses.But it seems to have worked, and a report released this week showed the extent to which the lockdown shielded the centre and south of Italy from the pandemic.The report, by the Italian health ministry and the national statistics agency, found that nearly 1.5 million Italians have come into contact with the coronavirus – six times more than the official figure.It revealed sharp regional differences – in the northern region of Lombardy, which was hardest hit by the pandemic, 7.5 per cent of the population tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.In Sicily, which was barely touched by the virus, just 0.3 per cent have antibodies, and in half a dozen other southern regions less than one per cent of residents had virus antibodies.Dr Franco Locatelli, a key government adviser on the pandemic, said the geographic variability in the results showed that the lockdown was absolutely crucial in sparing central and southern Italy from the same epidemiological wave that hit the north.The report “confirms that the establishment of red zones in the northern regions and then the national lockdown broke the chain of transmission, separating the north from the south and the islands (of Sicily and Sardinia),” said Roberto Speranza, the health minister.Since the lockdown was eased, anti-coronavirus protocols have been maintained. On buses, trains and ferries, it is compulsory to wear masks and compliance is close to 100 per cent.There has been a remarkable level of consensus over the need to keep wearing masks and they have become part of the fabric of life, with people looping them over their elbows or slipping them into a handbag when they are not needed.Office workers who have returned to work have their temperature tested on arrival and are required to wear masks in communal areas of their offices.Bottles of hand sanitiser and pedal-operated dispensers are ubiquitous and companies have cut the number of people allowed to occupy offices.As Italians flock to the coast for their holidays, even beach bars require people to wear masks as they line up for a cold Peroni or a café macchiato in their bikinis and board shorts– and the majority comply.“It’s clear that we won’t return to normal living until we have a vaccine. It will be found, but it will probably take two years before it is available to everyone,” said Giorgo Palu, a professor of virology at Padua University and a former president of the European Society for Virology.The popular stereotype of Italians being unruly, undisciplined and resistant to following rules and regulations has been turned on its head in the last five months.There may have been cultural factors at play. Italians tend to be anxious over their health – children are told not to run around and sweat too much in the summer and ordered not to swim within an hour or two of eating adults obsess over the dangers of catching a chill or worse from air-conditioning or draughts.Angst over personal health may have encouraged widespread respect of the anti-virus measures.“The trend is positive, thanks to the containment measures that were taken,” Marcello Tavio, the president of the Italian Society of Infectious Diseases, told La Repubblica newspaper.But the hard-won gains of the last few months could easily be lost if people drop their guard and start relaxing.Health experts and ministers are constantly warning that disaster lurks around the corner if Italy becomes too complacent.There is alarm over young people going out at night, crowding into piazzas to socialise, drink and flirt.“We are seeing too many gatherings, with people not taking the necessary precautions,” said Dr Tavio.The holiday island of Capri, near Naples, was so alarmed at the number of tourists congregating in its piazzas that it ordered masks to be worn outside as well as inside.The colder temperatures of the autumn and winter could lead to a dramatic spike in contagions unless health protocols are maintained, said Dr Tavio.“We have to be very careful in the autumn, when the favourable climate conditions of summer will end. The health system will need to intercept new cases at the earliest possible stage.”There is also concern over immigrant workers from Eastern European countries like Romania, and Asian countries like Bangladesh, bringing new cases into the country. A new wave of illegal migrants arriving from Tunisia and Libya is also causing alarm, with some of them found to have Covid-19.Mr Speranza, the health minister, says Italy is by no means out of danger yet.  “We cannot lower our guard. We may be out of the storm, but we are not yet in a safe harbour.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beirut explosion chemicals abandoned russian businessman triggered","story":"The timer was ticking from six years ago, when 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were taken from an impounded ship and stored in the port of Beirut. It was a massive bomb just waiting to go off a disaster equivalent to an earthquake measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale.At least 100 are dead and an astonishing 4,000 are injured in a catastrophe in one of the Middle East’s greatest cities. About 300,000 more are homeless.And all because Igor Grechushkinof, the Russian owner of the Rhosus ship, carrying the deadly cargo from Georgia to Mozambique, declared bankruptcy on an unscheduled stop, and was forced to abandon it there. It left the authorities with a fearsome problem, and one they appear to have dealt with by crossing their fingers and hoping for the best.  Not for nothing was ammonium nitrate, used in farming as a powerful fertiliser, the explosive  of choice for the IRA during the Troubles. The high-profile mainland bombings at the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate in the City of London in 1992 and 1993, and the blast at Canary Wharf in February 1996, bringing the first IRA ceasefire to an end, were all fuelled by it. Even the most portent of those devices contained just one five-thousandth of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut on Tuesday. It was also used by Timothy McVeigh in his two-tonne bomb that claimed 168 lives in Oklahoma City in 1995. And it is the Taliban’s preferred option too. For all that, ammonium nitrate can be safely stored. It is stable, under the right conditions. There are international protocols on how much can be held, where, and under what security precautions. It must be kept away from fuel and sources of heat, and many countries require carbon carbonate to be added, which makes it safer.Leaving it dumped in one place since 2104 and in such quantity was always likely to end badly, said Stewart Walker, associate professor in Forensic, Environmental and Analytical Chemistry at Flinders University in south Australia. Philip Ingram, an explosives expert and former military intelligence officer, said: “Ammonium nitrate can degrade over time, all the more so if it is stored badly. If it starts to degrade, it gives off heat, and that tends to self-perpetuate. Pressure builds.”All it needs then is an appropriate spark, serious enough ignition. The IRA used small amounts of Semtex. Here, according to reports, it came when a welder was making repairs to improve the security at the warehouse. It is suspected that the building contained fireworks. When the explosion ripped through the port, the firefighters trying to contain the initial blaze are believed to have been incinerated. Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey California, said the footage supported the firework-as-ignition theory: “Some of the videos show munitions what I call popcorning, exploding like ‘pop, pop, pop’. It’s very common to see fires detonate explosives. If you have a fire raging next to something explosive, and you don’t put it out, it blows up.” First, the video footage shows a fire with white smoke, consistent, says Professor Walker,  with ammonium nitrate burning. Then, there is a massive blast, orange and brown in colour, consistent with nitrous dioxide, given off when ammonium nitrate explodes.  And finally there is a massive white mushroom cloud, which evoked comparisons to Hiroshima, when the Americans dropped the nuclear bomb to ended World War Two in August 1945. In fact, according to Mr Ingram, it is water condensation, common in massive explosions in humid climates, created by the explosion’s massive supersonic waves.  Those waves then blasted out through Beirut, causing apocalyptic scenes of damage up to 10km away. According to reports, the blast could be heard 150 miles away in Cyprus.  Mr Ingram explains: “With high-end detonations, supersonic pressure gets magnified, and the bigger the explosion, the more it gets magnified. There are two effects: blowing and sucking.“The over-pressure wave blows everything over in its way, and then there’s a big following dip in pressure. That sucks everything back in. “The bigger the over-pressure wave, the bigger the under-pressure one. Floors rise on the over-pressure wave, and fall on the under-pressure, and it explains why high rise buildings can collapse.”Mr Ingram says: “It really does depend how close. But as the over-pressure wave passes over, the inidual would feel the air being sucked from his lungs. And if very close, it is possible that his organs would explode. The effect is similar to being in a major car crash.“But that will be very, very few. Most of those who have died will have been hit by falling buildings or debris, and it is the glass and shrapnel that are responsible for such a massive toll of injuries The big shortage at the hospitals will be for blood supplies.” The nitrate came from the Rhosus cargo ship, which was carrying the explosive chemical from Georgia to Mozambique in 2013 when it made an unscheduled stop in Beirut, according to reports from the time. While commonly used as an industrial fertiliser, ammonia nitrate is also a component in mining explosives. Mozambique has significant mineral and mining industries.Mr Grechushkin declared bankruptcy and was forced to abandon the ship there after Lebanese authorities prevented it from sailing on, crew members said. Several sailors were stranded in the country for months.“Owing to the risks associated with retaining the ammonium nitrate on board the vessel, the port authorities discharged the cargo onto the port’s warehouses,” a shipping report from 2015 said.“The vessel and cargo remain to date in port awaiting auctioning andor proper disposal.”Lebanese customs officials repeatedly asked for the matter to be handled but said they had received no reply. The  attempted to contact Mr Grechushkin for comment.Lebanon has not tied the Rhosus’s cargo to the blast.Professor Walker said: “There were a host of circumstances which should never have been allowed to happen: there was too much in one place it needs to be compartmentalised to leave it there for so long is bad practice, and, of course it was a place with a high population density. It could and should have been avoided.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"beiruts explosion years making","story":"It’s hard to pinpoint exactly where it all went wrong for Lebanon. The country - described in better times variously as the Paris of the Middle East for its exuberant glamour and the Switzerland of the region for its exemplary banking sector - had looked to be thriving in recent years.Tourist numbers were up, the beaches along its beautiful Mediterranean coastline were packed. The middle classes appeared more comfortable than they had ever been.For those who had money at least, Lebanon was a pleasant enough place to live. But the image belied a much more complicated reality - something I witnessed first-hand as a correspondent in the capital, Beirut, for The .Lebanon had borrowed up to its eyeballs and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst. Corruption and greed among its ruling class - warlords who had held onto power since the end of the civil war in 1990 - had helped bleed the country dry. The politicians didn’t even bother trying to hide it, simply blaming one another for the empty coffers.Infighting between the competing religious sects over who would be awarded the spoils had left them virtually incapable of governing. The problem with Lebanon, as Marwan Muasher, vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, put it, is that “corruption has been democratised, it’s not sitting centrally with one man. It’s all over.”Many in Lebanon had predicted an explosion, though few could have imagined it would come in the form of the 2,750-tonne blast that would devastate half the city.Beirutis on Tuesday began cursing the country’s politicians before an official investigation was even underway. Experience had taught them that either incompetence or negligence would be behind the disaster, which has claimed the lives of at least 75 people and injured as many as 3,000 more.Initial reports suggested that authorities had seized several thousand tonnes of highly combustible ammonium nitrate a number of years ago and had been storing it at the seaport. The blast was suspected to have been triggered by a welder\u0027s fire.Questions will soon be asked as to who signed off on the idea to keep such a large quantity of a volatile and explosive substance stored in a densely populated civilian area. “What exploded today in Beirut is not just ammonium nitrate. It is above all corruption, mismanagement, incompetency and cynical disregard for the security and lives of people,” wrote Lebanese national Dyab Abou Jahjah, expressing the thoughts of many of his countrymen.Lebanon had for months been teetering towards ruin.By the time I left Beirut in February after a four-year reporting stint, there were daily street protests against government corruption. Saad Hariri, the prime minister (of course the son of a previous premier) stepped down only to be replaced by another equally loathed businessman.Then the coronavirus hit. Lebanon had the sense to shut down - fearing that its already beleaguered hospitals would not be able to cope with a major outbreak. But the lockdown sent its poorest - rendered jobless - spiralling into even deeper poverty.At the same time, the country was beginning to feel the full effect of its freefalling economy. The country’s currency lost 60 per cent in value in a matter of weeks. Last month it became the first in the Middle East in history to experience hyperinflation.Food prices soared 200 per cent. A jar of instant Nescafe coffee peaked at $50 - a week’s wages for many.Beirut\u0027s once proud and thriving middle class have been forced to sell possessions online. Some have even begged for money for nappies. They knew there was no point looking to the government for help, it had been unable to provide the basics to its people - including water and electricity - even during the “good times”.On Monday, the country’s foreign minister resigned, warning that a lack of vision and a will to implement reforms risked turning Lebanon into a “failed state.” There is little to suggest it can do much now to avoid its wretched fate.Thousands in the Lebanese capital would have had a restless sleep in their dark, hot and windowless homes last night, contemplating what has befallen them. The windows may have been knocked out by the blast, but the darkness was of the country’s own making.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news two cruise lines discover cases covid 19","story":"Holidays have resumed in Greece since it appeared on the UK\u0026#39s \u0026#39travel corridors\u0026#39 list last monthCoronavirus latest: Pubs and shops don\u0027t need to close, says ministerHow to get travel insurance should you choose to ignore FCO advice​The best options for a last-minute holiday ​Sign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletterGreeks and holidaymakers have been told to stick to rules aimed at controlling Covid-19, as cases creep up in the country.Greece recorded 121 new cases on Tuesday, which is the highest daily tally since April 22.

This has made it one of the safest bets for last-minute holiday this summer.Read our article to find out: how did they do it?While some remain reticent to travel, millions of Britons have already returned from their first post-pandemic holidays - indeed, around 600,000 of us were in Spain when the Government put the entire country on the quarantine naughty step last month.  Travel’s writers have filed postcards from France, Malta, the Greek islands, Iceland and Amsterdam in recent weeks, as well as various corners of the UK, and they reported both pros and cons when it comes to Covid-era holidays. On the plus side, beaches and attractions are often quieter, and - deprived of income for four months - tourism workers are rolling out the red carpet. On the other hand, the new rules around masks and social distancing can make relaxation difficult, while some locals - those that don’t rely on visitor spending - haven’t been so welcoming. There’s also the form-filling faff once you’re back on British soil. So what was your first post-lockdown break like? Where did you go and what did you learn? Was it worth the four-month wait or did you find it hard to get into the holiday spirit? Were the locals pleased to see you? Did you feel safe, or were the social distancing rules a little OTT? Comment at the bottom of the live blog to share your experiences. We’ll publish a round-up of the most interesting and insightful responses next week.Millions of Britons are swapping their usual holiday in the Med for a summer staycation.But with Cornwall and Devon oversubscribed, where can you go for peace and quiet?Our UK experts suggest their favourite lesser-known corners. Starting with, Carmarthenshire: Cinderella of the Welsh coast.Visitors to the National History Museum have expressed their delight as the venue opened its doors for the first time in months today.People queued outside the London museum this morning to become some of the first members of the public to go inside since it was forced to close at the start of the coronavirus outbreak.A range of new safety measures have been put in place, including mandatory pre-booking, a reduction in the museum\u0027s capacity and social distancing rules.The Natural History Museum closed in MarchJen White, a 36-year-old production manager, travelled with her children from Manchester for a visit to the museum. She told the PA news agency: I have been homeschooling these guys, so we have been literally cooped up in the house. I just wanted to get out and educate them somewhere that is not a home school setting. I think when they get in they will be wowed because we have never done this before.Vicky Lowry said her son had told her on the way to the museum: This is going to be the best day of my life.More bad news for Victoria, which on Wednesday reported its deadliest day of the coronavirus outbreak: 15 fatalities in the past 24 hours and a record daily rise in infections.The Australian state reported 725 new cases compared with 439 a day earlier. It recorded its previous one-day high of 723 cases and 13 deaths last week.Victoria earlier this week imposed a night curfew, tightened restrictions on people\u0027s daily movements and ordered large parts of the local economy to close to slow the spread of coronavirus.Tourism has gone extinct in MelbourneHosier Lane today, famed for its street art and a popular visitor attraction A postcard from Melbourne, where residents are breaking the draconian lockdown to buy Big MacsCanal holiday bookings have gone up by 150 per cent since lockdown lifted, reports one boat operator.Lucky then, that opportunities to take to the water are plentiful within the UK, with more than 2,000 miles of navigable inland waterways on the island of Britain alone. Here are some of the best options.Ripe for social distancingThe global death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 700,000 on Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally, with the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico leading the rise in fatalities.Nearly 5,900 people are dying every 24 hours from COVID-19 on average, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the past two weeks.That equates to 247 people per hour, or one person every 15 seconds.By contrast, 2,030 people around the world die per hour from cardiovasculcar disease.Bars, restaurants and cafes have been ordered to close as lockdown restrictions are reimposed in Aberdeen over a coronavirus cluster in the area.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 54 cases have now been reported in the outbreak.A five-mile travel rule has been put in place and residents are being told not to enter each other\u0027s houses. All indoor and outdoor hospitality venues have been told to close by 5pm today.The measures, which apply to the Aberdeen City area, will be backed by Government regulations, Ms Sturgeon said, and will be enforced if the rules are not followed.The First Minister said people should not travel to Aberdeen, but those who are already there can remain.Guests and crew on a North Sea cruise ship are now in quarantine, after a passenger tested positive for Covid-19.The passenger who sailed on SeaDream tested positive after returning home to Denmark. SeaDream was the first cruise liner to resume international ocean cruising since the pandemic.According to SeaDream, the passenger had been travelling home to Denmark from Tromsø, departing the Norwegian city on August 2. It is believed that the passenger had no symptoms. Guests are now in isolation as the ship returns to Bodø.Diamond Princess was the first cruise with a major Covid-19 outbreak, back in FebruaryThis comes after UnCruise Adventures – the first to resume overnight cruises in US waters – confirmed on Tuesday that a passenger on its current Alaska voyage tested positive for Covid-19.In a statement, SeaDream Yacht Club said: “We sincerely hope that there is no COVID-19 on board, and we are not aware of any other guests or crew who are infected or have any symptoms, but we are taking all necessary precautions. “All guests and crew were informed, as well as the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) and the Norwegian Directorate of Health as soon as we received the information this afternoon.”Sweden’s light-touch lockdown failed to spare its economy from a historic plunge in GDP as Covid-19 triggered a collapse in exports and spending.Output contracted by a record 8.6pc in the second quarter compared with the previous three months, but the Nordic nation suffered a much smaller hit than many other European economies.Despite some of the most relaxed Covid-19 restrictions in the world, its exporters were hit by tumbling global demand and household spending slumped as the virus struck. Read the full report here.Spain and Portugal might be off the cards, but there are plenty of favourites in Europe with case numbers under control (either better or comparable to the UK) where you will neither have to quarantine on arrival nor return, and where you can – crucially – hit the beach without wearing a face mask.Here are your best bets for a last-minute, quarantine-free escape.We have received comments from Britons arriving back in the UK.Carly Reed returned from a family holiday in Spain on Sunday, July 26, the day after the Government changed its Foreign Office advice for the country and removed it from the travel corridor list.“Since we’ve been back, we haven’t had one phone call,” she said. “We’ve followed the rules to a tee, but no one has contacted us, neither I nor my husband. Not even an email to say your quarantine will end on this day. Not even a text.“It’s ridiculous. When I got to the customs guy at Newquay Airport, he was very strict and officious – it did make you realise that this is quite serious – but then nothing.”Frederico Felix lives in Slough. He returned from Portugal – a country excluded from the UK’s ‘green’ list – on Sunday. “I was really surprised when I landed in the UK, but in a negative way. No airport staff or Border Force officers were wearing face masks everyone in Portugal was,” he said. “After I left the aircraft a member of staff from Heathrow asked me if I completed the form and that’s it, no one actually checked if I really did or not.“Since I arrived home no one from the Government has been in touch with me at all.”Read the full report from Hugh Morris, here.What constitutes seaside perfection, for you?Latin America has surpassed Europe to become the region with the highest number of Covid-19 deaths worldwide, according to Reuters.Brazil, the Latin American country most affected by coronavirus, recorded a total of 95,819 deaths as of Tuesday. Mexico, the second-most affected country in the region, has reported 48,869 deaths.The spread of the pandemic has also accelerated in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Peru.Last week, Latin America also became the most-affected region by number of cases – surpassing 5 million on Monday.With some scorching days ahead, and millions of Britons understandably keen for a dose of seaside fun, crowds are likely at many of the UK’s best-known beaches.

The rule also covers market hours at Albert Cuypstraat and Plein ‘40–’45, Greg Dickinson reports.To those not au fait with Amsterdam, this can broadly translate as “the busiest bits”. Although, slightly confusingly, the central Dam Square and Damrak, the avenue leading to Centraal Station, will not require face masks. Nor will Nieuwmarkt, a square just to the east of the Red Light District.The head of communications of the Lake District National Park has issued a plea for people to camp responsibly.The Irish Government has decided not to move to Phase 4 of its Covid-19 recovery plan, meaning pubs and hotel bars remain closed.Taoiseach (Irish PM) Micheál Martin said the Republic of Ireland could not risk moving backward. Mr Martin said the decision would be reviewed again in three weeks\u0027 time.Pubs in Ireland will not reopen until 31 August at the earliestThe next phase would also have allowed gatherings of up to 500 people outdoors and 50 indoors.It is the second deferral of Phase 4 after the Irish cabinet voted to delay it in July amid concerns about the spread of the virus.On Tuesday, the cabinet also made changes to the green list for travel and announced face coverings will be mandatory in shops and shopping centres from Monday 10 August.Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar, San Marino and Monaco have been removed from the list of countries from which travellers would not have to self-quarantine for 14 days.Laura Craik, who recently returned from Denmark to the UK, writes:The form itself is confusing, geared towards visitors rather than residents.

Arguably the high point of his Russophilia came in the aftermath of the Salisbury poisonings two years ago, when he declined to criticise Moscow in the face of incontrovertible evidence that the attack was carried out by Russia’s GRU intelligence service.Mr Corbyn’s natural inclination to side with one of Britain’s most committed foes was entirely in keeping with decades of anti-British activity, from supporting the IRA at the height of its terrorist campaign against the British state to his more lucrative association with Iran’s ayatollahs, where he earned around $30,000 as a contributor to Tehran’s Press TV – until the channel was banned by British regulators for its part in filming the detention and torture of an Iranian journalist.Now, as revealed by The Daily  yesterday, it transpires that, during last year’s general election campaign, Mr Corbyn made use of classified documents that had apparently been stolen from the email account of Dr Liam Fox, the former international trade secretary, by Russian hackers.The documents, which Mr Corbyn did not know had been obtained through hacking, referred to sensitive details concerning US-UK trade negotiations and were used by the Labour leader during an election rally to attack the Government for putting the NHS “up for sale”.The fact that Mr Corbyn had employed material stolen by Russian hackers to gain the advantage in a British general election was made public last month by the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, who revealed that “Russian actors” had sought to influence the election result by leaking illicitly acquired government documents.What makes Mr Corbyn’s conduct even more contemptible is that it now appears the documents were obtained after Russia hacked the private emails of a serving cabinet minister.Dr Fox himself is not entirely beyond reproach when it comes to safeguarding sensitive material, as he has something of a reputation for being accident prone in terms of breaches of sensitive information. On the eve of the 2010 general election, when Dr Fox was shadow defence secretary, he prompted a major security scare when his laptop computer was stolen from his London flat.On another occasion, as defence secretary, he was forced to call in the police after a personal letter to David Cameron warning of “draconian” defence cuts was leaked to this newspaper.The suggestion that Russian hackers were able to access Dr Fox’s account multiple times between July and October last year certainly raises some important questions as to whether measures put in place by the National Cyber Security Centre to protect government communications are effective against hostile states, such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.Moreover, there is no shortage of useful idiots operating at the highest level of British politics who have no qualms about associating with hostile states.For example, the most striking conclusion reached by the recent investigation conducted by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) into Russian meddling in British politics was Moscow’s involvement in attempts to influence the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.At the time Alex Salmond, the then SNP leader, made no secret of his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he “publicly admired” certain aspects of his involvement in Crimea, which led to Moscow’s unlawful annexation of the province.Since standing down as SNP leader, Mr Salmond has become a regular fixture on Moscow’s state-run RT propaganda channel. Moreover, Mr Salmond has resisted pressure to end his association with RT, despite the ISC report accusing the channel of putting out “serious distortions” in its coverage of British politics.Nor is the willingness of Britain’s useful idiots to champion the interests of hostile states confined to Moscow. The recent political controversy over the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has exposed an array of senior political and business figures who appear quite comfortable defending the interests of Beijing’s communist rulers.Indeed, it is entirely feasible that Britain’s sizeable pro-Beijing lobbying community would have succeeded in protecting Huawei’s stake in the country’s 5G network, with all the implications that would have had for our national security, had it not been for the intense pressure Downing Street came under from Washington to end the company’s involvement.It is crucial, therefore, that we do not underestimate the importance of useful idiots like Mr Corbyn in helping hostile states like Russia and China to achieve their nefarious objectivesMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/05/11/18/germany.jpg","title":"schools reopen coronavirus test trace system headteachers","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.All students are expected to return in SeptemberThe Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A more effective test and trace system is needed to make schools and parents feel more confident as students return in September, headteachers have told The Independent following a recent study into the programme. Simon Smith, who leads a primary school in Yorkshire, said test and trace was a “key element” in keeping schools safe. “Parents need to feel all the systems are there,” he told The Independent, ”and that if something does happen, things will happen very, very quickly in terms of the actions that schools will take”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Track and trace is a key part of that,” the headteacher at East Whitby Primary Academy said.His comments come after a study has suggested the government must scale-up its test and trace system - which tells people if they have been contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus and to isolate for two weeks – to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections as schools fully reopen. What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyOne of the authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), said the current testing system has “about 50 per cent coverage”.A government minister said the plan for English schools to welcome all students back next month is “not up for debate” on Tuesday following the study’s publication. Speaking about test and trace, Mr Smith from East Whitby Primary Academy said: “As a headteacher, I feel very little confidence at the moment around the fact we would be informed, or everybody is being informed that should be informed.“It may be people are wandering around with the virus without knowing.”Pepe Di’Iasio, a headteacher near Rotherham, said a scaled-up test and trace system would help his school feel better prepared for the September return. “I think we would all feel better if we had confidence in the system and obviously with four weeks to go,” Mr Di’Iasio, who is also vice president elect of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), told The Independent. “We would rather have that confidence as quickly as possible.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers from University College London and LSHTM simulated various scenarios to examine the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents returning to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The authors of the modelling study – published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health - found that “with increased levels of testing... and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.“Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave,” Mr Bonell from LSHTM said.“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage,” he added.The NAHT, a school leaders’ union, said the new research showed “just how many factors there are to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which are entirely outside a school’s control”.Efficient test-trace-isolate system needed to reopen schools- studyMinisters still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMPs criticise school meal voucher scheme for covering M\u0026ampS but not LidlPaul Whiteman, the general secretary, said: “The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within.”He added: “The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.”Meanwhile, Richard Bettsworth from ASCL said: “It is very clear that an effective test, trace, and isolate strategy is vital in suppressing the rate of infection, and keeping schools open.” The director of public affairs added: “The government has to make sure that this works at the scale that is necessary.”Schools are expected to fully reopen to all students in September.  A government spokesperson said: “We have rapidly built, from scratch, the largest diagnostic testing industry in British history. Over 16 million tests have been delivered so far and we have the capacity to carry out more than 330,000 tests per day, growing to 500,000 per day by the end of October.“Plans have been put in place to ensure schools can re-open safely. Local health officials, using the latest data, will able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases.They added: “The NHS Test and Trace service has now and contacted more than 218,000 people who have tested positive for the virus, or recently been in contact with someone who has tested positive – in order to break the chain of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press Associationtest and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Progress is accelerating.Future versions of the Starship spacecraft could hold up to 100 people, with the most optimistic predictions for launch suggesting missions could commence as early as 2024. Earlier this year, Musk revealed that SpaceX is building floating, superheavy-class spaceports for Starship rockets travelling between Earth, the moon and Mars.The spacecraft facilities will also be used to launch passengers travelling at hypersonic speeds around Earth.The technology billionaire has frequently spoken about his desire to make humanity a multi-planetary species, and even hopes to travel to Mars in his lifetime.Speaking at a satellite conference in March, Musk said he feared progress towards this goal was happening at too slow a pace.We\u0027ve got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars, he said.Created with Sketch.

This year, the flat racing\u0027s biggest meeting, is behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreakDr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment – not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has various options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind.”He said the discovery showed nerve cells respond to damage by sending mitochondria, the powerhouse of cells, to the area of damage and using the diabetes drug the team were able to enhance the response.Dr Mahad said: “This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.”Prof Paul Matthews, director of the UK dementia research institute at Imperial College London, and who was not involved in the study, urged caution over the findings.He said: “This is a well-designed set of experiments that provide interesting new data consistent with – but not independently establishing – benefits for a metabolic therapy for MS. It adds usefully to the literature, but is not itself the ‘game changer’ or ‘Holy Grail’.”He added: “This new research demonstrates that damage is reduced in an experimental nerve model after chemical treatment to strip off the myelin coating by the common diabetic drug pioglitazone.  It provides a possible explanation for earlier preliminary observations of possible benefits of the drug for people with multiple sclerosis (MS).  Further well-designed studies of this relatively safe drug in people with MS seem well warranted.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will mean no one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Ammonium nitrate appears to be the cause of the huge explosion that has left large parts of Beirut ruined and at least 100 people dead.Some 2,750 tonnes of the material had been stored in a warehouse for six years without proper security measures, according to Lebanese president Michel Aoun.The scale of the blast – which could be felt as far away as Cyprus – appears similar to other incidents where ammonium nitrate has exploded, experts have said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the chemical, which is used as an agricultural fertiliser, is unable to explode on its own. While it is a powerful fuel for explosions, because it includes both the fuel and oxygen required for a fire – and has been used as such in terror attacks – it still needs to be ignited by heat, since it cannot detonate on its own.Early videos suggest the fireworks could have played that role. Videos show a small initial fire, accompanied by the small sparks and pops of fireworks going off, before the large explosion happens and engulfs the city around it.Search for survivors as Beirut wakes up to huge devastation - updatesThat larger blast had all the hallmarks of being caused by ammonium nitrate. After it had cleared, orange clouds could be seen, which are probably toxic nitrogen dioxide gas that is released by explosions that involve nitrates.The white cloud that came alongside the massive blast and quickly spread through the city appears to be a condensation cloud. Those typically accompany massive explosions in humid conditions, following the shock waves, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.The repeated betrayal of Beirut\u0027s suffering citizens is a travestyAerial footage of Beirut explosion reveals extent of devastationFormer aide slams Trump for \u0027spitballing\u0027 cause of Beirut blastsAmmonium nitrate is typically used for agricultural fertiliser. It is a relatively simple and inexpensive way of providing plants with nitrates.It is naturally occurring, and comes in the form of a white solid that dissolves in water that is also known as saltpetre. It is mostly made synthetically, in industrial production that allows it to be produced relatively cheaply for agricultural use.Another legitimate use is in controlled explosions, such as those during mining and civil construction work.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut ammonium nitrate is not explosive in itself, and still needs something specific to ignite it. In its pure state, it is actually relatively hard to ignite, though if it is mixed with something like oil it becomes much more dangerous.Once it is detonated, however, it produces oxygen, meaning that it can very quickly increase the scale of an existing fire. As such, in many of the intentional and accidental disasters it has caused, it has acted to escalate explosions rather than as the first cause of them.The particular way that the explosion happened will change the number and types of casualties that will be expected, said David Caldicott, an emergency consultant and senior clinical lecturer in medicine at the Australian National University.This explosion can be considered as a ‘high order’ explosion, with an obvious blast wave seen to be propagated from a massive secondary explosion, that followed on from the event, he said.Primary injuries are blast-related, as a consequence of the overpressure wave interacting with the hollow space in victims lung injuries are often survived, but subsequently fatal, and bowel injuries are common.Secondary injuries are caused by flying debris effectively environmental shrapnel.Tertiary injuries are as a consequence of being thrown by the blast, and quaternary injuries by other features such as inhalation.Many famous bombing incidents – including those carried by the IRA in London through the 90s – made use of the explosive powers of fertiliser.As a result, the chemical is tightly regulated in many countries. Though it cannot be banned as a result of its use in agriculture, both the purchase and storage of ammonium nitrate is governed by tightly-defined health and safety legislation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

This year, the flat racing\u0027s biggest meeting, is behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak“They might give the initial information then start to get a bit sick of the whole process and give up,” he said. “I think that’s a problem – a problem for just collecting the data. They collect metrics about how well they are doing, the NHS test and trace, but as epidemiologists we kind of want other metrics to be measured and they are not really doing that at the moment.” His frank assessment of the track and trace system follows a study published earlier this week, which claimed that with increased levels of testing and effective track, trace and isolate system in place “an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.The study, published in the Lancet Child And Adolescent Health journal, analysed data from the first wave of the coronavirus and modelled the potential impact of schools across the country reopening next month in order to understand how the virus can be kept under control.But they warned the government that reopening schools in September, alongside workplaces, without a scaled-up programme “could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave”.Writing in , Sir Keir Starmer also urged the government to use the remainder of the summer to improve the track and system to avoid Britain facing “a long and bleak winter” with a spike in infections.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that poses a real risk of amplification of transmission, of case numbers going up quite sharply.He added: In terms of the reproduction value, the \u0027R\u0027 value, opening high schools could increase it by as much as a half, but by as little as 0.2 or 0.3, but it will go up.Given we\u0027re at \u0027R\u0027 equal to one at the moment, clearly we don\u0027t want \u0027R\u0027 going up to 1.5 or so, that would ... lead to quite rapid growth of the epidemic.Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that with increased levels of testing and effective contact tracing “an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyHowever, they warned: “Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave.”“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.”Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a lecturer in mathematical modelling at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL and lead author of the study, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that if test and trace is “not done effectively, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year”.Pressed on the study, Mr Clarke told Sky News: “It’s obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that we’re making with test and trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working, I really would emphasise that.” The housing minister said over 184,000 people have so far been contacted by the NHS test and trace programme after a contact tested positive for the virus. He added: “Those people have been allowed to self-isolate, be removed from the community at a time where they could be at risk of spreading the virus and that’s obviously a massive success.

So this is a programme, which is delivering and which is helping to keep us all safer. There’s always more to do, we continue to work very hard to boost our testing capacity – we’re on track to deliver half a million be the end of October. “But one thing is clear: schools are going to reopen in full in autumn, that is not up for debate.”Speaking in the Commons after the decision to drop the target of returning all primary school children back to classrooms before the summer holidays, Boris Johnson said “primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance”.No 10 yesterday reiterated the prime minister’s commitment, adding: “That’s vital for their education and development. We are planning for all pupils to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.”Schools reopening ‘risks second Covid-19 wave twice as big as first’Mr Clarke added: “There’s nothing gung-ho about getting schools back. There is little doubt about the major damage that it does to children’s education not to be in school. We’ve lost half a year now to this virus and some children’s education and it’s disrupted every child’s education.“It’s an absolute priority that we get on with this, it is a basic matter of social justice, there is a generation of children whose performance will be inhibited throughout the rest of their time in education unless we get this right and we’re confident that we can.”Speaking to Times Radio, former prime minister Tony Blair also urged the government to appoint a senior minister to be put in charge of testing, adding: “From the very beginning mass testing has been the only thing that gets you through this. “It allows you to avoid the severity of the very blunt instrument of lockdown and gets you to a place where you can more or less get your economy moving while you contain this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many Kashmiris would prefer the region be granted independence from both countries, but there is no clear opinion polling on where the majority view lies.India said it revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and removed protections on settlement from the rest of India in order to foster greater investment in the region and bring its people equality with the rest of the country.Kashmir’s internet shutdown is risking lives during the pandemicDeadly clashes erupt between Kashmir protesters and Indian troopsLabour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Modi challenged in court over ‘draconian’ use of colonial-era lawsHundreds protest India’s treatment of Kashmir in LondonBut many ethnic Kashmiris see the move as an attempt to use settlers to engineer a demographic change in India’s only Muslim-majority region. And they have been left feeling disenfranchised by a move in which they were not consulted, and which was accompanied by the house arrest of the leaders of all the major local political parties.Speaking to The Independent, residents of Kashmir described how a year of crackdown followed by pandemic lockdown has frozen their economy and denied them basic rights to justice, freedom of speech, access to education and the internet.It is not known exactly how many people were arrested in Kashmir just before and in the aftermath of 5 August 2019, mostly because they were detained under the controversial Public Safety Act (PSA) which allows suspects to be held without charge or any due process for up to two years.While court records suggest 662 petitions challenging PSA detentions were filed in 2019, Habeel Iqbal, a 34-year-old human rights lawyer from South Kashmir’s Shopian district, said he believes detentions over the last year number in the “thousands”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile foreign journalists have not been permitted to enter Kashmir for more than 12 months, local reporters say they face intimidation and pressure from the security forces.The president of Kashmir’s Chamber of Commerce said this week that the shutdown of the internet and the subsequent pandemic lockdown had cost the region’s economy an estimated Rs400bn (£4bn). While some internet services were restored in January, faster 4G mobile networks remain blocked and business leaders say 2G services are too slow for most commercial enterprises to operate on.Anam Khan, a young Kashmiri businesswoman who returned to the region to acquire the Books and Bricks cafe in Srinagar just two months before the August 2019 crackdown, said bricks-and-mortar businesses have ground to a halt as well.Even when movement restrictions eased a little in October, the cafe “struggled to keep afloat through the winter months”, she said. Then, just as business started to pick up in February, “the pandemic broke”.India’s top court rules ban on internet in Kashmir ‘unconstitutional’“For a young entrepreneur who invested in her dream and in a city she loved, I feel crushed every single day. For a Kashmiri, our loss is not just monetary, it is emotional as well.”Ms Khan said she had been receiving mental health treatment after the uncertainty and emotional strain reached a threshold “beyond what I could have handled”. “It is very hard to go on with each day when you feel torn on the inside, but what options do I have?”The lack of internet access has hurt all aspects of Kashmiri society, but students have been particularly badly affected, according to Aabid Mustaq, a 21-year-old fourth year law student at Kashmir University.Being unable to access online resources has impacted “the whole process of researching for our studies”, he said. “I have found myself stagnant as I can’t access realtime time new judgements. If the internet is barred, that ultimately directly jeopardises our whole degree.”Monitoring groups say that India has become the world’s leading country in internet shutdowns, with the majority taking place in Kashmir.Anuradha Bhasin, the editor of the region’s largest English-language daily newspaper in the Kashmir Times, told a panel discussion marking the anniversary that the internet ban had “pushed a certain population behind an iron wall”.“The world is talking about work-from-home culture, talking about online. These kind of things do not work in this place.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.For hundreds of thousands in Beirut, the wreckage caused by Tuesday’s colossal explosion came as a shock that will take some time to process. For the former crew of a Russian-owned vessel abandoned in the docks in late 2013, it likely came as less of a surprise. On Tuesday evening, local media reported the blast was caused by the explosion of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been transferred from the Rhosus cargo ship in 2014. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Rhosus sailed under a Moldovan flag but was reportedly owned by Igor Grechushkin, a native of Khabarovsk in Russia’s Far East, and was manned by a crew of Russians and Ukrainians.According to contemporary reports, the Rhosus was scheduled to transport its cargo from the Georgian port of Batumi to Biera in Mozambique in late 2013. But along the way it fell into technical problems, and failed a safety inspection in Beirut. The ship was later seized after its owner apparently ran out of money. Search for survivors as Beirut wakes up to huge devastation – updatesIn July 2014, with his crew essentially hostages and running out of provisions, Captain Boris Prokoshev warned of the dangers of his cargo. “We’ve been here since October, with a cargo of ammonium nitrate, an explosive substance, in the hold,” he told a journalist of the Ukrainian Sailor newspaper. “We’ve been abandoned, living with no wage on a powder keg for the last 10 months.”A Russian newspaper that reported on the situation carried a headline that reads especially eerily today: “Crew of the Rhosus cargo ship are hostages aboard a floating bomb.” According to Captain Prokoshev, the owner of the vessel went missing after owing the crew upwards of US 200,000 dollars in wages. Social media posts about the reported owner, Mr Grechushkin, and his company, Teto Shipping Ltd, contain several similar claims.Natalya Klamm, director of the Odessa-based Assol foundation, which assisted the sailors at the time, told The Independent the situation the men found themselves was not unique.

Yes, people were happy when they were eventually released, but it was six years ago and frankly it wasn’t so unusual to remember an awful lot about it.” Following representations by Ukrainian diplomats, local authorities agreed to release five of the sailors. The Russian captain and three senior Ukrainian crewmen stayed onboard — and would only be allowed to travel home in September 2014. Around that time, authorities granted permission for the dangerous cargo to be disembarked for “safekeeping” in the Beirut port’s warehouse number 12. The transfer is recorded in an article written by two lawyers in Arrest News in October 2015.Lebanon President Michel Aoun described the failure to deal with the stockpile of ammonium nitrate as “unacceptable” and said those responsible would face the harshest punishment.”A probe has now been launched, with the investigating committee expected to present findings within five days.Early reports suggest the explosion followed repair work to the warehouse, sparks from which caused unidentified pellets to explode — and following that, the ammonium nitrate.

combing through police files on her daughter’s discovery.The heartbroken mum revealed in her book how the family’s routine with friends they were holidaying with could have been easily monitored by anyone watching them.A friend of the family had made a block booking at a tapas restaurant close to their apartment so they could check on their young children intermittently.She wrote: “It wasn’t until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese police files that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.“This book was by definition accessible to all staff and, albeit unintentionally, probably to guests and visitors, too.“To my horror, I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and simply to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had added the reason for our request.“[It was because] we wanted to eat close to our apartment as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.”Madeleine McCann was three when she disappeared while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May  .German investigators have alleged that Christian B, , killed her soon after abducting her from a holiday apartment in the resort.That’s despite British police continuing to treat her vanishing as a missing persons probe.He is in jail in Germany for drug dealing, and is appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old woman, also at Praia da Luz.German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation into him, previously told the PA news agency that prosecutors have “concrete evidence”, but not “forensic evidence” that Madeleine was killed by the suspect.He said they may “know more” than Scotland Yard, who are still treating the case as a missing person investigation.In her book Madeleine: Our Daughters Disappearance and the Continuing Search for Her, Kate McCann details how their ground-floor apartment was a “prime” spot for criminals.She wrote: “Though I envied David and Fiona with their sea view, being on the ground floor meant we didn’t have to worry about the children’s safety on a balcony.”Kate continues: “Later, we were told by the British police that the ground-floor location, access to roads front and side, secluded entrance and partial tree cover made our apartment a prime target for burglars and criminals.“Never once did this occur to us when we arrived.”Christian B kept kids’ clothes and swimwear in his mobile home, it has emerged.Convicted paedophile Christian B, , bought the red and white Allegro Bay RV in early  — three years after moving back to his native Germany from Portugal.Pals said he used it to drive regularly back and forth between Germany, Spain and Portugal and once boasted how he could allegedly “carry children and drugs” inside.Cops found the clothes and swimwear after seizing the RV as part of their probe into missing Inga Gehricke, who disappeared in  during a picnic with her parents.Christian B used a derelict crate factory at Neuwegers­leben as a weekend pad where he kept the RV.The items were found there in  along with USB sticks containing images of child sex abuse.Other images on the sticks included some of Christian B partially naked or wearing stockings performing a solo sex act.The six data sticks and two memory cards were found buried under the body of his dog at the factory, wrapped in a carrier bag.The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has been cleared of involvement in the rape and murder of another young girl.Christian B had been a suspect in the  killing of Claudia Ruf, , whose partly burned body was found  miles from the German town of Grevenbroich.She had been kidnapped while walking a neighbours dog.In an update this week, however, it was confirmed that he couldnt have been Claudias killer.#After comparing the information obtained, it can be said that Christian B was not in Grevenbroich at the time of the crime in the case of Claudia Ruf,# a police spokesman told Bild.#In addition, a DNA comparison is said to have been negative.#Last year, police in Grevenbroich started DNA tests on hundreds of men as they hoped for a breakthrough in the unsolved murder investigation.It will probably take until the end of  to complete the DNA screening with approximately  samples, Bild reports.Kate McCann still buys birthday and Christmas presents for missing Madeleine in the hope she will one day come home to open them.She has told how she carefully chooses gts every year that are the right age for her daughter # who would have turned  in May.Madeleine was nine days short of her fourth birthday when she was abducted on a family holiday in Portugal on May , .Kate, husband Gerry and their twins Sean and Amelie hold a birthday tea party every May  and put presents in Madeleines unchanged pink bedroom.On the tenth anniversary of Maddies disappearance, ex-GP Kate said: “I do all the present buying.#I think about what age she is and buy something that, whenever we find her, will still be appropriate so there’s a lot of thought goes into it.”She referred to the birthday of her eldest child as a #dficult time because that’s when you really feel her absence.”Cops from Britain, Germany and Portugal worked together in secret for three years to track down the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Officers revealed in June this year that a -year-old German paedophile is their top suspect following a -year investigation.He was living in a campervan in Praia da Luz in Portugal around the time the youngster was abducted on May , .It wasnt until , ten years after the little girl went missing, that he became a key suspect after police appealed for information on where Madeleine could be.The call for help sparked a tip-off about a German man who was known to have been in the area at the time.And Thereports that, for the past three years, officers from the Met have been secretly working with Germany’s Bundeskriminalamtand Portugal’s Policia Judiciaria to track their man down.The Met’s Operation Grange team, led by Detective Inspector Mark Cranwell, spent months working on the tip about the unknown German, before contacting the BKA in November  to ask for their help.Madeleine McCann’s parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, said on their website http:wwwmadeleine that their hope of seeing their daughter again had not faded.“All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice,” the couple wrote.“We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.”They added in a June  update: “We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine.”Police searching the cellar of Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B are looking for evidence of a murder, the editor of Bild newspaper has claimed.Cops in Germany last week excavated an allotment known to have been used by Christian, and are rumoured to be planning a search of a second.Convicted sex offender Christian B, , was named by police as a prime suspect in the McCann case in June.He is known to have been living in the Praia de Luz resort around the time of Madeleines disappearance in , and at some time after to have ed to his native Germany.Julian Reichelt, editor of German tabloid Bild, has claimed they were searching for evidence of a murder.#What we are hearing from our sources is that they have moved into the direction of recovering and finding evidence that will make this a murder case clearly to everyone,# he told Good Morning Britain.#The German investigation has declared this a murder case but so far it is completely unclear to the public how that is, what proof makes this a murder case and not a case of missing child to

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The source said a fire had started at warehouse  of the port and spread to warehouse , where the ammonium nitrate was stored.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs claimed customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why, he said.Another source said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.The explosion erupted next to a towering building called the Beirut Port Silos, which could be seen partially collapsed amid the rubble of nearby buildings.The intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and rescue teams were today still trying to recover bodies.Many of those killed were port and custom employees and people working in the area or driving through during rush hour.The blast also knocked out a crater some  metersacross that filled with seawater.Those leading the rescue effort today chillingly warned the death toll is likely to rise.Images taken from the scene showed a thick cloud of gray smoke hovering over the Mediterranean before an enormous burst of red and orange fumes exploded into the sky.Up to , people have also now been left homeless by the explosion which caused around £bn of damage, claimed local reports.At hospitals across the city people had been waiting all night for news of loved ones who had gone missing or were wounded. Others posted requests for help online.It is not yet known how many British nationals are among those caught up in the aftermath of a huge blast, the Foreign Office confirmed this morning. Lebanese President Michel Aoun has declared a state of emergency for Beirut for two weeks - and vowed the harshest punishments for those responsible for causing the explosion.Nearby structures wereflattened, windows and doors wereblown out, cars were crushed, and fires burned as the sun set over Beirut.Horrying video of the explosion shows an enormous mushroom cloud over the city followed by a shockwave - with witnesses comparing it to a nuclear bomb.Toxic gases were been reported in the aftermath along with strange orange clouds, with the US Embassy warning any Americans in Beirut to stay inside.Many people are feared to still be trapped under the rubble - including those stuck inside their damaged homes.Locals woke to apocalyptic scenes this morning with smoke still rising from the port, where a towering grain silo was shattered.Streets were littered with debris and damaged vehicles, and building facades were blown out.Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants.However, it is also one of the main components used in mining explosives and in bombs by terror groups.When an explosive compound, like ammonium nitrate detonates, it releases a gas which rapidly expands. This “shock wave” is essentially a wall of dense air that can cause damage as it spreads. A mass of exploding ammonium nitrate produces a blast that moves at many times the speed of sound.This wave can reflect and bounce as it moves destroying some buildings while leaving others relatively undamaged.The explosive power of ammonium nitrate can be as high as about  percent of the power of TNT.At  percent the power of TNT, the detonation of , tons of ammonium nitrate could produce a shock wave felt over a mile away.The same explosion would produce enough force at a range of  feet to destroy most buildings, and kill people either through direct trauma or being struck by debris.In , a ship carrying an estimated , tons of ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded in the harbor of Texas City, Texas, starting a chain reaction of blasts and blazes that killed  people.Its like a war zone. Im speechless, Beiruts mayor, Jamal Itani, told Reuters while inspecting the damage. This is a catastrophe for Beirut and Lebanon.The head of the countrys Red Cross said: What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe. There are victims and casualties everywhere. Prime Minister Hassan Diab described the disaster as a national catastrophe and added those responsible will pay the price.His we and daughter were injured in the explosion after it damaged his residence at The Government Palace.The deadly blast was one of the worlds biggest-ever peacetime explosions.Lebanons health minister Hamad Hasan said the blast was a real catastrophe.Damage was reported up to six miles from the explosion, with windows shattered and building facades shredded by the shockwave.Beiruts governor Marwan Abboud compared the blast to the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear attacks that killed an estimated , people.Breaking into tears as he arrived at the scene of the disaster, he said: I ask the Lebanese people to pull together.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK stands ready to offer any support we can to Lebanon - and confirmed some caught up in the blast were Brits.He added: The pictures and videos from Beirut tonight are shocking. All of my thoughts and prayers are with those caught up in this terrible incident.International aid in the form of emergency workers and medical personnel is now heading to Lebanon.France says it is sending two planes with dozens of emergency workers, a mobile medical unit and  tonnes of aid.Emmanuel Macrons office says the aid should allow for the treatment of some  victims.French peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, have been helping since the explosions, they added.Jordan says a military field hospital including all necessary personnel will be dispatched and Egypt has opened a field hospital in Beirut to receive the wounded.Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek says Lebanon has accepted an offer to send a team of  rescuers with snfer dogs to Beirut.Denmark says it is ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, and Greece says it is ready to help Lebanese authorities with all means at its disposal.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump suggested the explosion may have been a bomb - describing it as a terrible attack.British grandmother Valerie Fakhoury, , from Darlington, who works at Beiruts American Community School was left with blood pouring from her head in the blast.All staff at the British embassy in Beirut are accounted for, but some have sustained non-le-threatening injuries.British journalist Lizzie Porter, who lives just one mile from the scene, told the Daily Mail: It was .pm and there was a rumble like thunder.

There will be people who refuse to pay.”Four and a half million pensioners will be sent a -page letter and application form when then their licence expires.Each household should submit photocopies of their documents from the Department for Work and Pensions or the Pension Service to prove that they are in receipt of pension credit.A bank statement will also be acceptedthey don’t have access to a photocopier.The BBC agreed to make over s exempt from the fee back in  after an agreement was hammered out with the Government.The subsidy will continue to be offered to over s on pension credit – which includes those on a weekly income below £. and couples on less than £..But Corporation bosses have since said the BBC cannot afford to continue the universal entitlement, which would hit programmes and services.The move has been slammed by campaigners and politicians with Boris Johnson saying the Beeb has made the “wrong decision”.An official spokesman for the PM said last month: We recognise the value of free TV licences for over s and believe that they should be funded by the BBC.Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said it was a “sad day” for elderly Brits who feel like they are being “let down” by the government and the BBC.She said that more than half a million of the poorest pensioners will still have to pay for a licence, cut spending on other essentials like food or heating, give up TV altogether or keep watching without a licence, in breach of the law because they still do not qualy for pension credit.It is deplorable that any older person should have to make such a horrible choice.”However, the BBC said maintaining the subsidy would cost £million a year and would lead to the closure of BBC Two as well as other channels and radio station.A spokeswoman said: It was the Government that ended funding for over-s TV licences and that the BBC has made the fairest decision possible to support the poorest, oldest pensioners.She added: Critically, it isnt the BBC making judgments about poverty - the Government sets and controls pension credit.The decision to start the new scheme in August has not been easy but delaying the introduction has cost the BBC over £ million and we cannot afford to delay any further.Continuing with the Government scheme would have cost £ million a year and rising and would have meant the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio  Live, and a number of local radio stations.These closures would profoundly damage the BBC for everyone, especially older people who use the BBC the most.A Department for Digital, Culture, Media  Sport spokesperson said: We are bitterly disappointed by the BBCs decision not to extend the over  licence fee concession beyond August.The BBC remains responsible for the concession and for setting out what those affected will now need to do.

Mr Gibb said the Government would steer clear of reimposing national school closures to curb the virus, despite warnings opening up classrooms could cause a second wave by December. He stressed that all the areas currently forced to follow stricter rules than the rest of the country would see their kids finally go back to class. But when pushed he did not rule out some schools needing to shut up shop againthere are local spikes in cases. He said: Were now looking locally at when we impose new restrictions - they will be locally imposed.But so far as the current local restrictions at the moment go including in Manchester all schools will be open in September, and indeed in other parts where there have been local lockdowns such as Leicester.Mr Gibb said schools would be safe - even after the warnings of a second spike - and they had introduced hygiene measures including hand washing and staggered lunch breaks to stop the spread of Covid-. Childrens Commissioner Anne Longfield has demanded kids education is made a national priority and is put before pubs and restaurants. She called for regular testing of pupils and teachers - regardless of whether they show symptoms. Laying down a marker on future closures, she wrote: “If the choice has to be made in a local area about whether to keep pubs or schools open, then schools must always take priority.”Ms Longfields briefing paper says keeping schools open should be the absolute priority, adding: Education should be prioritised over other sectors: first to open, last to close.When only a limited amount of social interaction is feasible, the amount accounted for by education must be protected - at the expense of other sectors activities.Responding to Ms Longfield, Mr Gibb said this morning: Anne Longfield is right.

It was originally reported by some as a hit and run, but investigations indicated that racist language was used at the scene and it was then treated by the police as a racially aggravated attack.“The victim’s family were anxious the incident should be seen and understood by the wider public.“It’s, for this reason, they asked us specically to show the photos of this man’s injuries and were also determined that we should report the racist language, in full, alleged to have been spoken by the occupants of the car.”The statement added the decision to use the word was made by “senior editorial figures”.It added: “Notwithstanding the family’s wishes, we independently considered whether the use of the highly offensive word was editorially justied given the context. “The decision to use the word was not taken lightly and without considerable detailed thought: we were aware that it would cause offence.”The bulletin, which originally aired last Wednesday, was quickly removed from the BBC website after viewers expressed their outrage on Twitter.One person said: “I really don’t think that word was necessary. Saying racial slur would have been enough.”Another wrote: “As a woman of colour I am highly offended at this! Such a demonstration of poor judgement and zero sensitivity exercised here especially in light of the times we are currently facing, completely disgraceful!”Others were also horried to hear the word on day-time TV and shared their disbelief online.

The rule not to travel further than five miles away from your home has also been reinstated in the Aberdeen City Council area and residents have been told not visit each other in houses.Single adult households who have joined up in a support bubble with another household can continue to visit. Ms Sturgeon also told people not to travel to Aberdeen.It comes just days after the Queen arrived in Scotland to spend time at her Balmoral estate over the summer.Her Majesty is staying around  miles outside of Aberdeen, and flew into the citys airport from RAF Northolt.The new rules in Aberdeen are far tougher than local lockdowns in Greater Manchester and parts of northern England - where people are no longer allowed to visit indoors, but can still head to the pub.There were  new cases of the virus Scotland wide. Nicola Sturgeon announced today: She said this lunchtime: So, a precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now - dficult though that undoubtedly is - in order to try and contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.This high number of cases certainly heightens our concern that we are dealing with a signicant outbreak in Aberdeen that may involve some community transmission.Now, the main link identied in this cluster has been the Hawthorn Bar in Aberdeen city centre, however more detailed analysis by NHS Grampian and Test  Protect has shown that this one venue does not account for all of the positive cases.The First Minister said changes will be reviewed every seven days starting next Wednesday when she hopes the restrictions could be removed either entirely or partially. Staff suddenly out of work will be able to be re-furloughed under the job retention scheme. The harsh restrictions could be extended to parts of Aberdeenshirethey need to be, Ms Sturgeon said.She added that the outbreak was a sharp reminder of what happenspeople let their guard drop and start behind like normal again. She said:should serve as a warning to all of us. It comes days before all kids are set to go back to school in Scotland on August .Ms Sturgeon said she took the decision after being struck by comments from the Childrens Commissioner for England Anne Longfield demanding schools should be allowed to open at all costs - evenit means shutting pubs. She said:As I said earlier, this is also about doing everything we can to ensure our children canto school next week.Aberdeen schools are holding orientation sessions next Wednesday, with schools due to open fully the following Monday, th August.Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and space to protect the ability of our young people toto education.Ms Sturgeon said the decision to close hospitality venues was not taken lightly but extreme caution was necessary to tackle any growth in coronavirus cases. She said: Im also mindful of the need to act quickly and decisivelywe are to succeed in our aim of keeping transmission as close to elimination levels as possible.Local MP Stephen Flynn tweeted following the announcement: Restrictions being put back in place in Aberdeen is what we all feared. However, they are an absolute necessity in order to protect public health.

These men who showed no remorse, no guilt or sorrow for taking such an innocent and heroic le away will find themselves able to live out the rest of their lives free and able to commit more crimes and continue to put people in danger when they are released in a very small number of years.”It came after the court heard a car driven by Long at breakneck speed swung PC Andrew Harper like a pendulum along a country lane on August , .PC Harper was in the process of apprehending the teen gang during a botched robbery near Reading, Berks.The jury came back with the verdict after deliberating for two days, which left his tearful widow Lissie in tears.Jurors were told how the traveller teens had tried to steal the £, bike from the home of Peter Wallis in remote Bradfield Southend, when they were apprehended by PC Harper.The gang had cased the property earlier in the day and later ed masked and armed with an axe, crowbars and aof pipe to use against anyone in their way. PC Harpers devastated widow Lissie wrote an open letter to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and former Labour Home Secretary LordBlunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country.At sentencing, all three were warned they will not be eligible for release until they have served at least two thirds of their sentence - meaning leader of the gang Long could be back on the streets in just ten years.And his accomplices could be out in just eight yearsthey serve the minimum - despite Mr Justice Edis telling them the killing was very close to murder.The Attorney General has no power to order a retrial, and prosecutors would either need new and compelling evidence to apply for the acquittals to be quashed, or there would need to be proven interference with the jury.A spokesman for the Attorney Generals Office said: The Attorney Generals thoughts are with the family and friends of Pc Andrew Harper at this dficult time.I can confirm that we have received a request for the cases of Henry Long, Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole to be considered under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.The Law Officers have  days from sentencing to consider the case.In her letter to the Prime Minister Lissie Harper said she implored him to hear her request.She wrote: If there is even the slightest chance that this abominable injustice can be rectied then I will do everything I possibly can to ensure that it is.Lissie added: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be.The PMs spokesman said he would responded to Mrs Harpers letter formally once legal proceedings have concluded.”The killers families wept and gasped as the sentences were handed down, while Lissies mum Julie Beckett applauded.Sentencing, the judge said nothing he can do can “restore Andrew Harper to his loving we or family, adding: His devastating loss in terrible circumstances will follow his family for ever.”Describing the killers as young, unintelligent but professional criminals, he added none of them had shown anything resembling remorse.The soft sentences dished out to Long, Bowers and Cole were met with fury by social media users.One person wrote: Absolutely disgusting, no justice for him, his family or his beautul we. Another failing by the system.Another read: Disgraceful sentencing.One person fumed: So thats all his le was worth then  I feel sick at this verdict.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Office for National Statistics said , of those whoaposd shielded who normally workwere not at all comfortable working outside their home.

But guidance for them to stay at home in almost all circumstances ended on August . Shielded people are now under the same rules as the rest of England. They are encouraged toto workneeded by their employer, and send their children to school. Children whoaposve been shielding themselves are also being told they canto school.It comes as Boris Johnson plans for every school in England to reopen to all pupils full-time next month - ending a six-month amnesty on absence fines.Schools Minister Mr Gibb was asked todayparents whoaposve been shielding could avoid being fined for absencethey keep their children out of school. But Mr Gibb gave no guarantee. Instead, he told LBC radio: Well of course shielding was paused on August . Fines have always been a last resort in terms of non-attendance in schools and headteachers will use their discretion very carefully and they always have done. But we are saying that from September, school is mandatory for pupils. We want children back in schools. It’s best for the wellbeing, it’s best for their education, they should be with their friends and their teachers.

Oliver Crozier was running through the bushes near his home in Clovenstone, Edinburgh, when he was momentarily exposed to the plant. The weed has been sprouting across the UK, leaving kids with burns in north-west England, the West Midlands, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland, to name just a few. The invasive species has been dubbed Britainaposs most dangerous plant. Oliveraposs dad Scott, , thought it was sunburn when he saw Oliver’s leg the next day, but then blisters formed overnight. He said: “The blisters caused me concern because he has never had anything like that before. “He also had a blister on each wrist and one up on his inner thigh. “All the small blisters kind of got bigger and started forming larger blisters.” Scott took the lad to the AE at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, where his wounds were treated and medication was prescribed for the itch. He added: “The pictures then got emailed to his GP and they phoned saying they wanted him down to the surgery so they could pop the blisters and cut the flap of skin off as well.” Even though the exposure lasted only an instant, Scott said the skin took two weeks to heal. And for some it takes longer still.  One mum from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, said she could still feel the burn even now after lting her two-year-old son away from a giant hogweed in late April. She said: “We were walking along the Bridgewater Canal and my son loves walking but he was tired and had a tantrum. “When he does this he throws himself on the floor – unfortunately on top of a young giant hogweed plant. “I picked him up thrashing about still… it wasn’t until the next day that I noticed the odd burn patches on both myself and my son. “At first I thought the sun cream had wiped off but then both the patches on myself and my son started to bubble.” The -year-old, who asked not to be named, urged other parents to be on their guard. She said: “Please don’t let your children go near it, and be vigilant – even a young plant can cause damage. “And take baby wipes everywhere with you!” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero pc andrew harpers mum","story":"NewsHero PC Andrew Harpers mum leads calls for tougher jail terms for killersPC Harpers mother welcomed the prospect of tougher sentence for the teenagers who killed him - saying Andrew deserves so much betterShareByTom Pettor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsPC Andrew Harper and mother Deborah Adlam on his wedding day\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Andrew deserves so much better. “We can’t bring him back but we can hope there’s something... to give him the justice he deserves.” Henry Long, , and Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were jailed for manslaughter for a crime the judge described as being “very close to murder in its seriousness”.

Cole and Bowers, the passengers at the time, were each jailed for  years, so they could be out in eight. Speaking about the killers’ joy in court at being convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, Debbie said: “That was very insulting. To see them jumping and celebrating was hard enough. They got away with it really. “But now hopefully the sentence can be increased to something that is a little more realistic for the crime that they’ve committed. “Losing Andrew has been above and beyond what we could even imagine. It’s knocked us sideways.” A spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office confirmed it has received a request for the jail terms to be looked at under the “unduly lenient” sentence scheme.  Askedshe would use the phrase “unduly lenient” to describe the sentences handed down, Debbie said: “We really felt that. “I think because there were so many years knocked off for being of a certain age and for admitting manslaughter early on – the years they are going to do once they have taken out their allowances... to me that’s criminal.” PC Harper’s widow Lissie, , told the Old Bailey how she has been plunged into a “lost and endless world of numb despair”.

Miss Bunker, , told friend Monique Riggon she didn’t need a place to stay and not to worry, adding: “I’ve got Wes, I’ll be fine, I’ll walk back with him, I’ll be safe’.” But Wesley Streete took advantage of the barmaid’s trust during what should have been a -minute walk through Tamworth, Staffordshire, in the early hours of September  last year. Streete, , “forced himself on her sexually” and strangled her to death with his arm in Wigginton Park, and then dumped her body face-down in a brook, where it was discovered hours later by her devastated uncle during a search by worried family, friends and police. Miss Bunker had been celebrating her th birthday with Miss Riggon in Birmingham city centre, where they attended an Aitch concert at the O Institute and then met up with Streete to go clubbing before taking a taxi back to Tamworth. Giving evidence, Miss Riggon tearfully recounted how she had offered Miss Bunker a place to sleep for the night, but Keeley declined. Miss Riggon told jurors at Stafford Crown Court: “She said she was tired and wanted to go home. She would walk home with Wes. She said ‘I’ve got Wes, I’ll be fine, I’ll walk back with him, I’ll be safe’’.” The prosecution told the jury that Miss Bunker “trusted” Streete to get her home safe during the -minute walk from Miss Riggon’s home, but he attacked and killed her. Miss Bunker’s family became worried when she didn’t make it home and she failed to answer her mobile phone. She didn’t show up for a job interview at a school that she was excited about. Her dad Christopher reported her missing to Staffordshire Police, and family and friends posted appeals on Facebook and began a search.  They also quizzed Streete, who insisted he and Miss Bunker had parted ways at a telephone box. However, he was soon arrested by police. After Miss Bunker’s bag was found in the park, her uncle Jason Brown focused his search there and tragically discovered her body in the brook. He had spotted a “red object” and then hair as he moved closer to investigate.Mr Brown told the jury: Then I saw an arm with a bracelet. I knew what it was in front of me. I just started shouting ‘no’.” Dean Reynolds, an off-duty police officer who was nearby during the search, said in a statement that Mr Brownaposs agonising shouts were the most horrendous screaming I have heard in my le.Streete changed his story at least four times after he was arrested, initially telling police he and Miss Bunker had parted ways. At one point he claimed Miss Bunker fell and hit her head on a gatepost, and he tried to massage her head and chest to save her. He told the jury he accidentally killed her as they had sex in a park, and admitted dumping her body in the brook and covering her with branches. However, he insisted that he hid her in a “panic”. The prosecution said CCTV, mobile phone data and DNA all proved he was lying, with Miss Bunker’s blood, saliva and make-up found on his top.

Mr Justice Warby said that both sides have been fighting a tit-for-tat PR battle outside the High Court courtroom. Todayaposs decision in the ongoing -month legal fight between the duchess and Associated Newspapers was a victory for Meghan, as the judge ruled that the identities of her five friends who spoke to a magazine should remain protected.But handing down his decision, Mr Justice Warby criticised both the claimant and the defendant. He wrote: It is... clear that neither side has, so far, been willing to confine the presentation of its case to the courtroom. Both sides have demonstrated an eagerness to play out the merits of their dispute in public, outside the courtroom, and primarily in media reports. Warning both sides he said: This will be a judge-alone trial, not a trial by jury. But to fight proceedings in court and through litigation PR or sensational reporting at one and the same time is not designed to enhance understanding of the legal process. For a party to file and immediately publicise prejudicial and partisan characterisations of the other’s litigation conduct in the media before a hearing certainly does not assist.  He said that the coverage has selectively highlighted aspects of the defendant’s case and features of the claimant’s case that are novel and interesting to the public. The focus is on sensational reporting of information that happens to be contained in the claimant’s statements of case. Meghan is suing the publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline over an article which reproduced parts of a private and confidential handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father Thomas Markle, , in August .  At a preliminary hearing in London last week, Meghanaposs lawyers applied for the five friends who gave an interview to People magazine to remain anonymous in reports of the proceedings. In a ruling on Wednesday, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an order which protects the identities of the five iniduals. In the People article, published in February last year, the friends spoke out against the bullying Meghan said she has faced. They have only been identied in confidential court documents.  The duchess, , says her friends gave the interview without her knowledge, and denies a claim made by ANL that she caused or permitted the People article to be published. At a hearing last week, Meghanaposs lawyers argued that the friends - referred to as A to E - have a right to anonymity both as confidential journalistic sources and under their own privacy rights. In a ruling today, Mr Justice Warby said he had concluded that for the time being at least the duchess should be granted an injunction which protects the identities of the five iniduals. He described the ruling in favour of Meghan and her legal team as an “interim decision”. ANL won the first skirmish in the legal action on May , when Mr Justice Warby struck out parts of Meghanaposs claim, including allegations that the publisher acted dishonestly by leaving out certain passages of the letter.

Jemma Davies, , from Runcorn, was making breakfast for her young daughter when she made the grim discovery. She is convinced that they were spideraposs eggs - but the supermarket says otherwise.“My daughter has porridge every night with bananas in for her supper, Jemma told the  Liverpool Echo after the discovery on Saturday.“She’s got learning disabilities and she’s got a poor swallow so she can only have soft things. “As I was getting her porridge ready, I picked up the bunch of bananas and snapped one off - and that’s when I spotted it.” She says the eggs look like a cluster of small, round spheres covered by a silky, web-like material. She continued: “I made the mistake of googling spider eggs on bananas and it came up with Brazilian killer spider eggs. That was it then.” Jemma said she fears the eggs belong to the deadly Brazilian Wandering Spider but the supermarket strongly deny this and say they belong to a harmless insect called a mealybug. She contacted Asda and sent them the photos asking what she should do, and jokingly askedthey could come and take the bananas back and bring her a new fruit bowl and gin to calm her nerves.  The product quality team emailed back to say they were sorry she found an “unwelcome surprise” on her bananas and would investigate where they had been supplied from. In the meantime, Jemma wrapped the bananas - still in her favourite fruit bowl - in clingfilm and placed them out in the garden. She added: “I had to hide them from my son as he’s into bugs andhe spots them he’ll want to hatch them.” The next day she received an email from Asda saying “they were unable to trace the fruit back to its country of origin” but believed the “nest” to belong to an insect called the mealybug.

Paulo Dos Santos the Brazilian acro-bat is flipping his ft ins frame around the ring and the aerial artists are hanging about high on pre-show excitement. I, however, am standing against a white board gouged with deep blade marks, trying to stop myself shaking. “It’s important you don’t move,” says Toni Novoltini, the High Speed Kne Thrower from the Czech Republic, stating the bleedin’ obvious. “My we is my usual assistant and I’ve never hit her – but I did pin her dress to the board once.” Before I can askhe has practised much recently, a huge metal kne whistles past my face close enough to trim my eyebrows. Six more thud into the target and, as I check my limbs are intact, a huge cheer goes up from the assembled ensemble. I have passed my in-tents audition for Zippos Circus, the spectacular family show that is finally back in action after four months of corona lockdown. The big top is up again on Southsea Common, in Hampshire, ahead of a nationwide tour, and the -strong community have been working flat out to make things safe. As circuses are classed as outdoor venues they have now been allowed to reopen ahead of theatres. So, roll up, roll up, ladies, gentlemen and children and take your socially-distanced seats for the greatest covid-compliant show on earth.  “We are absolutely thrilled to be back,” says founder and director Martin Burton, aka Zippo the Clown. “We are calling this the Rebound Tour as we’re determined to bounce back to our brilliant best. “We’ve had to comply with stringent social distance and safety regulations but I’m confident our big top is now safer than my own home.” Rows of seats have been removed but families and households can sit in bubbles and, as seats all face forward, the wearing of masks is voluntary. But juggling safety concerns mean Martin and his we Julia are inevitably walking a commercial tightrope. He says: “We’re going to take a big hit. We usually seat , but now it’ll be .  Then there’s the expense of hand-sanitiser stations, PPE and the ‘deep-fogging’ machine we’ll use to disinfect between performances. “But everyone is just relieved and delighted to get back to work.” During lockdown the  artists –many from overseas and working on contracts – faced a tricky balancing act to make ends meet. Martin and Julia provided a safety net by allowing them to live at their winter quarters in Newbury, Berks. But circus folk aren’t used to sitting around doing nothing so, visas permitting, they found other jobs. The Kenyan tumblers became care-home assistants, a juggler and her family did night shts in a chicken factory and other performers worked as drivers.  “That’s the circus work ethic,” says Julia. “But our Mongolian acrobats didn’t speak English and couldn’t find jobs – so local charities helped raise the money to get them home.” Even the Ringmistress went to work in a meat-packing factory. Tracy Jones, , from Oswestry, North Wales, is the circus’s first female in the role. She is covering for veteran star Norman Barrett MBE who, at , is still shielding at home with his famous performing budgies. At  Tracy got a summer job as a stunt rider’s assistant then ran away to join the circus as a bareback rider, trapeze artist and snake performer. “I’d try anything,” she says. “My mum was mortied when I packed my bags but I just had to do it. “It’s the sense of community and the audience’s excitement. That’s why we’re so thrilled to be back. It’s not a job but a way of le. You get the bug.” But now, as well as compering, Tracy has a responsibility to keep the performers and audience safe from coronavirus.Sadly, that means no more audience participation – something that has hit the show’s French clown Emilion especially hard. “He had brilliant routines involving audience members,” says Julia. “Kids love to see their parents being dragged up. But it’s just not possible now. There are also no panto-style, ‘He’s behind you!’ routines either because of the risk of aerosol emissions. But gasping should be OK. That’s the usual reaction to the staggering first-half finale, which sees the Lucius Team of daredevil Brazilian motorbike riders hurtling round a metal cage at mph.  Although Martin is thinking of changing the Globe of Death’s name to the Globe of Speed… in case anyone is offended after the pandemic. “The perform-ers can’t line up at the end and shake hands or pose for photos,” he says. “It’s sad but it’s just the new normal and we are used to adapting. The show will still be absolutely amazing.” It turns out Emilion isn’t too down in the mouth – because today’s clowns don’t wear thick make-up any more. “That’s because of the whole killer clown nonsense,” tuts Martin who is president of Clowns International. “You can’t risk scaring the kids. Clowns got hijacked from comedy into horror, thanks to Stephen King. It’s really not funny but what can you do ” Circus people are superstitious folk. Green is rarely seen, you shouldn’t sit with your back to the ring and there must be no whistling or peacock feathers in the big top.

Tragic Seraphina Harrell was born after Crystal Kelley - who agreed to carry the infant for her biological parents - refused to have a termination in  in a landmark case. When the dispute turned ugly Crystal moved from Connecticut to Michigan in the US - where state law meant she could be recognised as Seraphinaaposs legal parent. The little girl was born with a rare condition called heterotaxy syndrome, which meant internal organs such as her stomach and liver were in the wrong place. She also suffered multiple heart defects and a brain condition called holoprosencephaly.  Shortly after her birth, Seraphina was adopted by the Harrell family in Massachusetts.Mum Rene Harrell said the little girl had a very, very meaningful and happy le, CNN reports.Her dad Thomas said: She had a lot of joy in her le and gave a lot of other people joy in ways that sometimes werenapost expected. Despite her health problems, the couple said, she was always happy and upbeat, the couple said.  Rene stated: What I heard over and over from so many of her doctors was they could never imagine that someone with Seraphinaaposs level of need could do as well as she did or be as joyful as she was. Rene said: She had the most confident, self-assured personality, and she told everyone what to do. In her letime she underwent three major heart surgeries and a number of minor procedures. Seraphina died after complications following necessary surgery, her family said. In a heartwarming obituary, her loved ones wrote: Seraphina’s larger than le personality only grew throughout her le, and you never had to guess what she was thinking or feeling.At least once a day, someone would snuggle up to her and repeat the Seraphina family motto: aposFor a girl who can’t talk, you sure are never quiet!apos She couldn’t walk by herself, but she persisted in turning everyone in the house into her personal mobility assistants.

Yesterday, easyJet CEO Johan Lundgren said they were expanding its schedule to % of normal capacity as demand surged beyond expectations.  UK airlines say there has been a real spike in demand for holidays in Greece, Turkey and Croatia, where coronavirus rates are lower than the UK and ing travellers do not have to self-isolate. After scrapping some flights to the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands last week, tour operator TUI said it would run extra flights to Greece and Turkey. Last week, they added seven new flights to Crete, Rhodes, Zante and Corfu in Greece and Dalaman and Antalya in Turkey. Mr Lundgren said he was encouraged by the number of people still opting to fly abroad in July, despite the new measures. Many holidaymakers facing quarantine restrictions switched their bookings to another country rather than cancel their holiday outright.  He said: There was an immediate decline in new sales. But the bookings lost out on to Spain were, to quite a large degree, picked up by the increased demand into Turkey, Croatia and Greece. But he criticised the quarantine measures - and called for the government to base it on regions rather than countries. He said: “We urged them to look at this from a regional basis, which I know that they are considering to do.  “But of course the damage and the uncertainty and the disruption for customers who had booked and needed to go home and quarantine for  days, that’s already been taking place.” He added: “You see parts of Spain – the Balearics and the Canary Islands – who have signicantly lower rates of infections than other parts of Spain and also in the UK.” Website Skyscanner, which handles  million searches a month, said there is a strong appetite for holidays later this year. Jon Thorne, a travel expert at Skyscanner, said: Our data shows that although Brits are sensitive to the changing situation, our love for certain hotspots endures. Tenere, Alicante and Malaga are still appearing in the top ten searches made last week for travel during the October half term. Holidaymakers flying to Spain and Portugal are taking extra risks after neither country made the apossafeapos travel list. This means Brits must self-isolate for  days upon , and the Foreign Office warns against all non-essential travel to both destinations, making nearly all travel insurance policies valid.

I could see damage to the buildings near me and a glowing red cloud and a plume of smoke. I couldnapost really move, I was rooted to the spot. My first thought was to go to a phone and call my parents, in case they saw a newsflash. I found my way back to one of the campus apartments. Everyone was walking in a daze. As soon as I got near the campus housing buildings, I could see there was panic. Everyone was saying they felt earthquake-like shakings and buildings had been shaking before the explosion. The Foreign Office has said that Embassy staff were injured in the blast. None of the injuries suffered were le-threatening. An FCO spokesman said: “All Embassy staff are accounted for. A small number have sustained non- le-threatening injuries and where necessary are receiving medical attention.”  Asked how many British nationals had been affected, the FCO said: “It is a fast moving situation and we are monitoring the situation closely.

I can say I didnapost see what I saw today in Ashrafia area, especially in front of the rum hospital and this aposheroineapos caught me inside the hospital and was accelerating to call despite the suspension of communication holding three newborn babies and surrounded by dozens of bodies and wounded. The explosion killed four nurses and injured about  patients, visitors and staff as it left the hospital non-operational. It suffered signicant damage and was without electricity in the hours after the explosion, which killed about  people, injured about , more and left dozens missing.  There were so many patients that doctors and nurses had to treat people in a car park outside after shattered glass and debris was cleared. The Lebanese Red Cross sent teams to transport patients to other hospitals.A doctor at the scene told Al Arabiya English: “We’re bringing the patients to the emergency building, and from there, we’re trying to send them to dferent hospitals because the urgent care is also full. What can we do ”Sleiman Haroun, head of the Syndicate of Hospitals in Lebanon, said mass injuries occurring amid the Covid- pandemic was“catastrophic. Hospitals were so overwhelmed that the walking wounded were turned away so medics could focus on those with le-threatening or more serious injuries.One local report claimed hospital morgues were full of bodies after the explosion occurred amid the coronavirus pandemic. There was an appeal for blood donations as stocks were depleted in the aftermath of the disaster. The explosion is thought to have been triggered by a fire that was sparked by a welder, according to local media. More than , tonnes of ammonium nitrate, used in fertilisers and bombs, exploded in a warehouse where it had been stored without safety measures for six years, according to officials. As teams searched the rubble for survivors and bodies, photos from the blast site showed apocalyptic scenes with a massive crater and buildings flattened by a blast that is said to have had a fth of the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.A preliminary investigation revealed Tuesdayaposs blast occurred after a fire was sparked by someone welding a small hole to prevent theft from the warehouse, the Lebanese TV station LBCI reported. A security source told Reuters it was started by welding work being carried out on a hole in the warehouse located in the Port of Beirut. Video posted on social media showed slashes and pops as the fire raged just moments before the explosion sent a shockwave through the city on the Mediterranean, leading to speculation the blast occurred at a fireworks storage site. Badri Daher, director general of Lebanese Customs, said it appears fireworks were being stored close to the ammonium nitrate. The explosive material was seized from a ship in . A shockwave that obliterated buildings and knocked people off their feet was felt as far away as Cyprus, some  miles from the blast site.  What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe, the head of Lebanonaposs Red Cross George Kettani told broadcaster Mayadeen. There are victims and casualties everywhere. Prime Minister Hassan Diab promised there would be accountability for the deadly blast at the dangerous warehouse, adding those responsible will pay the price. A number of British nationals, including embassy staff and journalists, were caught up in the disaster, with a small number suffering non-le-threatening injuries. Schools minister Nick Gibb told Sky News all embassy staff based in Beirut are accounted for.Mr Gibb added that we donapost know yet how many British nationals are affected and that the Prime Minister of Lebanon has asked for assistance. Dozens of people are feared to be missing and the death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue teams look for victims buried under twisted metal and debris from buildings. Dazed, weeping and injured people walked through streets searching for relatives.  Worried residents have been posting photos of the missing on social media as part of desperate efforts to find them. An Instagram account created after the blast now has dozens of appeals and more than , followers.There are many people missing. People are asking the emergency department about their loved ones and it is dficult to search at night because there is no electricity, Health Minister Hamad Hasan told Reuters. A number of countries have promised to send aid to Lebanon as thousands of residents were left homeless or forced to sleep in high-rise flats that suffered signicant damage.

So the idea of anyone causing harm or distress to a cute little pup is incredibly upsetting.But one family did just this to their dog, throwing the elderly animal out like rubbish when they decided to move house.The poor unwanted pooch, named Athena, was left tied up by a deserted café in Nikolaevka, Bulgaria, abandoned by those she loved most.To make matters worse, the cruel owners had also put a heavy chain around the dogaposs neck, meaning she was unable to go very far to find food or water. According to Paws  Hope, who shared her heartbreaking story, Athena survived off of scraps she was given by truck drivers who occasionally drove by her.Unsurprisingly she became extremely malnourished and her fur was soon riddled with fleas and ticks. Tragically while she was chained up, she also lost the sight in one of her eyes. However her sad story does in fact have a happy ending!  Laurica Nagel, who worked as a volunteer for a dog rescue organisation, heard a story about a dog tied up in the middle of nowhere and went to investigate.

The culprit, wearing a bright green t-shirt and black shorts, is seen looking down at the missing toes as he stood up. But instead of admitting what heaposd done, he then casually strolls off, presumably thinking heaposd got away with it. Furious history lovers have demanded action after the accident at the Gipsoteca Museum in Possagno, northern Italy. The man is said to be an Austrian tourist. The -year-old sculpture - the original plaster cast model from which artist Antonio Canova carved a famous statue of Paolina Bonaparte - was damaged on Friday. The artist, famous for his marble statues, lived between  and .Investigators told CNN there could be further damage to the base of the sculpture that the museum experts still have to ascertain. A furious Vittorio Sgarbi, president of the Antonio Canova Foundation, wrote on Facebook that the man must not remain unpunished andto his homeland.He fumed: The scarring of a Canova is unacceptable.

It’s been a long time coming. I can’t wait to get started and meet all the boys.“Now I’m here I want to prove to the manager and prove to the team I can help the club get where they want to be.“I know the league well, I’ve done well in the league before and I can see myself doing well at a club like this. It’s a massive club and the players here are top quality so I’m really forward to getting going.”The -year-old came very close to joining James McPake’s men back in January, only for time to run out at the end of the transfer window.And he says knowing the Dens boss has been an admirer for some time helped make the decision to sign up for the Dee six months later.He added: “It was really close, just didn’t quite work out, but I’m here now and happy to be here.“I think it’s half the battle being at a club that the manager likes you.”Mullen, who will wear the number nine jersey, will already have won over some fans after his play-off goal helped keep the Buddies in the Premiership at the end of season - at the expense of local rivals Dundee United.Meanwhile, former Dens loan ace Christophe Berra insists he is ready to revive his Hearts career after being unceremoniously axed by former boss Daniel Stendel.Berra, , remains baffled by the German’s decision to strip him of the captaincy and farm him out on loan to Dundee in January, emphasising that he was willing to fight for his place.He was excellent for James McPake’s side, who kept five clean sheets in six games featuring the veteran stopper.But Berra will go up against Dee with the Jambos in the Championship this season after reporting back for duty following the shutdown with renewed confidence.The defender, who is contracted to Hearts until next summer, is determined to battle his way into the plans of ing head coach Robbie Neilson, his ex-Tynecastle team-mate, and prove that age is no barrier.Reflecting on his enforced exile, Berra told the BBC: “I could understandI was a bad egg but I’m not.“I was happy to stay and fight for my place but the manager came in and you’ve got to respect his decision.“I went to Dundee and, looking back, that was a great thing for me. I played in six games, undefeated, kept five clean sheets and enjoyed my football.“I know I can still play at a good level. I don’t care about age #you are learning every day, putting in the sht and performing well then you can play far beyond your years.“I’ll do my utmost in training and, come the first game of the season,the manager decides to pick me, then great.“There are no guarantees in football no matter who you are. It’ll be down to me, in terms of how I perform in training and pre-season games.”Dundee and Hearts go head to head at Tynecastle on October , the Championship’s opening day, and Berra acknowledges the capital club are favourites for the title.However, he warned against anything approaching complacency.Berra added: “We have expectations as a club and, there’s not point hiding it, everyone expects us to go up.#We’re the hot favourites but in football, and sport in general, you need to earn the right to go up.“Every team we play against will be trying their hardest # and there are good teams down there good players. We need to have the right attitude and application.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It is great to have evidence that these services are highly valued and accessible to users.’’The study was commissioned by Community Pharmacy Scotland and carried out by academic researchers at RGU’s School of Pharmacy and Le Sciences and the University of Strathclyde’s Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences.It coincides with the launch of NHS Pharmacy First in Scotland: a new service in all community pharmacies across Scotland offering consultations for the treatment of minor illnesses and common clinical conditions.Harry McQuillan, CEO of Community Pharmacy Scotland, said: “CPS is delighted with the report, which demonstrates the clear value of community pharmacy teams. The report allows us to highlight this value with key decision makers. NHS Pharmacy First Scotland will only add to this report in terms of data.“This report, alongside this new service, should support further development of Pharmacy First so that the right person can receive the right care in the right place – with that place so often being the pharmacy at the centre of the inidual’s community.”The study highlights the signicant role community pharmacy teams play, alongside GPs, as a key component of the primary care team in encouraging self-management and acting as a touchpoint for Health and Social Care at the heart of the community.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I feel like I#m just getting started. Being injured I missed out on a lot of football over the last two years. I missed out the whole of the - season.#I played August-December this last season then I broke my foot. I played one game before lockdown. The last two years, I#ve only played consecutively for three months. I#m looking forward to playing a full season this year and it be a successful one at Peterhead.#I spoke to the gaffer# I played Peterhead a few times this season and they#re a good footballing side. I#m looking forward to the season.#He#s told me what he wants and I feel like it could really benefit my type of play. He said I#m a dferent type of striker to what he#s had and told me what we want to achieve. I#ve really bought into it.#I just cannot wait to kick a ball. The Betfred Cup is in October and I#ve got that date marked in my calendar.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking. Cycling has become ever more popular during lockdown and swimming in rivers and lakes is another wonderful way to get the blood pumping and improve your health. A survey taken at the start of lockdown revealed that one in four of us admitted that we were more active than before lockdown.This increased to one in three as lockdown continued, with combatting lockdown weight gain and helping mental health given as the top reasons many people are turning to some form of physical exercise. There is so much to choose from to keep you active from dusk to dawn.From aerial assault courses to horse riding treks, there are a massive range of outdoor family activities and endless possibilities for days out packed with family-friendly outdoor activities.No matter where you are, lakes and waterways make for not only incredibly scenic views but also cover a whole range of activities.The United Kingdom’s  National Parks also contain some of the nation’s most beautul and inspiring landscapes.You’ll find some of the best walking, cycling and horse riding locations and a whole host of other adventure activities in the spectacular parks.Add nearly  Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and you’ll find you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to exploring our famous countryside and keeping fit.NOTE: Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have dferent guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Whether you are heading for the hills, planning a coastal stroll or fancy splashing about in the sea or a lake, make sure you take time to check out what you need to do to stay safe.Visit visitbritain know-before-you-go to learn more about heading outdoors safely.Walking in Scotland means mighty mountains to conquer, plenty of forest paths or coastal walks to meander along, charming villages to discover, and exciting city routes to explore.Whether you’d like to enjoy a walking holiday, or simply an afternoon’s amble, you’re definitely in the right place when you are in Scotland.  What are you waiting for It’s time to explore one of Scotland’s best assets – the great outdoors Scotland’s Great Trails, such as the West Highland Way, the Great Glen Way, Fe Coastal Path and the Southern Upland Way are among the best walking routes in the world for experienced hikers and take you through some outstanding scenery.

The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place.

Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author.

Larkin, who was born in Coventry in  and died in Hull in , was a quintessentially English poet. At a time when international travel became routine he revelled in going nowhere. England made him and by and large held him under its spell. Interviewed for the Observer, he said he wouldnrsquot mind visiting China as long as he couldthe same day.Vacations were spent in the north of England or Scotland, whose landscape he loved and whose poets ndash especially Hugh MacDiarmid ndash he didnrsquot rate. In the mid-s the Larkins holidayed in Germany where his father Sydney, an anti-semite, felt very much at home. Sydney, who worked in local government, was also an admirer of Hitler and kept a statue of him on his mantelpiece reproducing a Nazi salute. Think Basil Fawlty and yoursquore on the right track.His loving son was no fan of Hitler and he was no anti-semite. His attitude to race, however, is complex to say the least, and best considered through the medium of jazz. For him, the music was at its most potent, hypnotic and enjoyable in its infancy when Louis Armstrong, the great crowd pleaser, was in his pomp. But along came the likes of Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charles Mingus who refused to pander to the stereotype of the black man entertaining whites. Larkin felt that what emanated from them was more than his ear could stand and he used his jazz column in the Dailyto explain why. ldquoItrsquos about time, he told one correspondent, ldquojazz had its Enoch Powell.Then there are the women. For a man who looked more like Eric Morecambe than Sean Connery, Larkinrsquos success rate offers hope to the bald, beer-bellied and bespectacled. He never married but was rarely short of a female companion, and was adept at stringing several women along simultaneously. Some have accused him of misogyny Irsquod suggest a verdict of not proven. But he did have a fondness for smutty jokes and was a keen collector of pornography, albeit of the sort that wouldnrsquot raise an eyebrow nowadays.Then there is his poetry which resonates still. No other modern English poet is so frequently quoted or invoked. Quite rightly he was offered the poet laureateship, but declined. Imagine the hullabaloohe was presently in post and his views on race, women and politicsbecame public.This edition of Larkinrsquos Collected Poems is remarkable not for the poems, which his fans must already have and know, but for the inclusion of a selection of his photographs, some of which have not been published previously.In his foreword, Andrew Motion notes that Larkin was a ldquocommitted amateur photographer who took his hobby seriously, but he was no Cartier-Bresson. Just  photographs are included which seems meagre. Their subject matter echoes that of his poetry: gravestones in a cemetery, cranes at Hull docks, the Larkin family on a beach the summer war broke out.Other photos are of two of his lovers ndash Monica Jones posing in a bathing costume, Maeve Brennan ldquoseen through reeds in a field ndash and of Larkin himself in his bachelor pad. The final one is of him leaning on a chair. Sitting in it is his mother who is wearing a floral dress and has in her lap a knitted rabbit. It was taken in the s. So glum and old and old-fashioned does Larkin look thatyou didnrsquot know otherwise yoursquod be forgiven for thinking that the pair were husband and we."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-preview-sensual-moving-daring-little-birds-feels-different-anything-else-tv","story":"\"They really affected me, and woke a sexual sort of fire that I didnt know I had\",\" notes the London-born star, who grew up in Somerset, and has been acting since she was a young teenager.Now,  years later, the quirky actress is playing the lead role - New York heiress Lucy Savage - in Sky Atlantics adaptation of Nins book.\"I made a lot of notes of little things that I wanted to add into the script, trying to get actual one-liner direct quotes from Little Birds, and I got a couple of them in there, which was really exciting,\" reflects Temple, star of films such as Atonement, St Trinians and Maleficent, plus Netflix series Dirty John.\"That was cool that everyone was open to me doing that.\"Little Birds is a six-part series, written by Sophia Al-Maria - an American-Qatari filmmaker and artist - and directed by Detroit-born Stacie Passon, whose previous projects include House Of Cards.When her husband Hugo does not greet her in the way she expected, she finds herself on a journey to freedom and independence.We see Lucy discovering the surprising, erse and degenerate world of Tangier, in Morocco, a country quivering on the cusp of independence. Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s... This is going to be very interesting for them.\"The show was shot in Tara in Spain, as well in Manchester.While on location, did the cast have any particularly memorable cast nights out after filming had finished for the day \"When wasnt there one !\" Temple quickly replies, grinning.\"Lots of dinners, lots of conversations, lots of laughter, lots of tears, lots of screaming, lots of hugging. It was great. It was also just an incredible learning experience.\"\"I always say that I am always surprised by how much we liked each other because Ive done so many projects with people that I absolutely hated,\" Marwan follows candidly.\"At the end of the day, its a job. But something about this felt dferent... This felt like a very, very special project where, for some reason, most of us felt very connected to each other.\"There was something about just all of us being there together that helped me a lot during the process of filming.\"\"Which makes it extra cruel we have to be doing press for this via Zoom, because of a pandemic!\" cries Temple. \"It really would be nice to be together to do this for real.\"Little Birds launches on Sky Atlantic on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"five-best-new-cars-towing-caravan","story":"Whether its a caravan, boat or trailer ndash or anything  in-between ndash having the right car for the job is essential when it comes to towing.Here, weve taken into account the maximum braked trailer towing capacity.

For safe towing, its usually recommended to only pull a caravan which weighs % of the tow cars total kerbweight. Be extremely carefultowing a caravan which exceeds this % rule.Weve been through the latest models, to see which cars are the very best for towing. Lets take a look.... Volvo XC DVolvos stylish XC won the Towcar of the Year award for , so its only fitting that it kicks this list off. Capable of towing up to ,kg of braked trailer, the XC is just as practical as it is good-looking.An optional retractable towbar means you dont need to disturb the cars clean lines when youre not hauling, while the interiors solid fit and finish should mean its up to the task for any adventure. It isnt overly large either, which means that when not towing, its relatively easy to park and position.. Volkswagen TouaregThe Volkswagen Touareg is a big, luxurious, high-riding SUV, which is capable of wolfing up hundreds of miles without a moments hesitation. It also - handily enough for this list - is excellent at towing.Its able to tow up to ,kg of braked trailer, and a silky-smooth turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine makes it a refined way of getting about.. Jaguar I-PaceIf youre looking to tow, then an electric vehicle might not immediately spring to mind. However, Jaguars I-Pace was designed to be capable of towing from the off, putting it in line with the firms go-anywhere mentality.As a result, itll tow up to kg. Well admit that its certainly on the lighter end of the scale, but its still admirable from an EV.. Skoda KodiaqThe Kodiaq is an excellent, well-valued choice in the seven-seater segment. Not only is it immensely practical but its also well priced, packing plenty of on-board technology and a vast suite of standard equipment.Plus, a .-litre turbocharged engine helps the Kodiaq to deliver a braked towing capacity of ,kg. Despite this load-lugging ability, the Kodiaq CO emissions are impressively low - just g km.. Land Rover DiscoveryThe Land Rover Discovery is a mammoth of the road, providing a luxurious, high-end driving experience for all on board. Its also packed with off-road technology and a iety of features which help it to keep going even when things get tough.Its impressive when it comes to towing too, thanks to a braked trailer rating of up to ,kg - which means its got more than enough pulling power for most occasions.Jack Evans"},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The unanswerable question for every Scottish Tory leader","story":"Few voters outside Moray know who Douglas Ross is.

Therersquos two big reasons TikTok has achieved the whirlwind success it has in an already busy field: Firstly, TiKTok provides a suite of surprisingly capable video-editing tools, free of charge on your mobile phone. You can create, edit and mody videos up to  seconds long, as well as add on popular music, songs and audio from a large library of recordings. Popular genres include comedy sketches, dance routines, make up, and fitness, alongside all sorts of other niche content creators.Secondly, it acts as a social media  by sharing usersrsquo videos to each other. Over time, the  develops an understanding of what sort of content each user enjoys, and creates a curated ldquoFor You page full of videos it thinks yoursquoll like. While most users are unlikely to reach a wide audience, successful creators can go viral and become ldquoTikTok famous. It may seem a little complicated but my -year-old sister insists itrsquos really quite simple.So why has it been so controversial TikTok stands accused of mistreating its underage users: fostering addiction, damaging attention spans, and failing to protect children from cyberbullying and inappropriate messages from adults. In February  the  was fined over M by the US FTC for collecting data on users under . Since then, the UK Information Commissionerrsquos Office have opened an investigation, alleging that the app fails to adequately protect children.Last November, TikTok admitted that it suppressed the content of disabled, ugly, deprived and LGBT users, allegedly in an effort to cut down on cyberbullying. Most damaging of all accusations has been that the app is influenced by the Chinese government.So is TikTok owned by China Itrsquos complicated. Ostensibly, ByteDanceis a private company based in mainland China. In reality, however, the Chinese Communist Party maintains a management committee over ByteDance and collaborates with it on CCP initiatives, blurring the line between the state and private sector in typical Chinese fashion. TikTok has been repeatedly accused of assisting the Chinese state by suppressing information about Chinese human rights violations, the Uighur genocide and the ongoing repression in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as promoting pro-CCP propaganda.Worst of all, the app has been charged with passing along personal, biometric and location data to Chinese intelligence services, an allegation the company strongly denies. Citing these reasons, the app has been banned by organisations such as the US Army, Joe Biden for President, and the Australian Defence Forces. The app has been banned entirely in India, and Donald Trump and several British Conservative MPs have made very clear their desire to do the same.Will the app be banned in the UK Under threat of a nationwide ban, ByteDance have scrambled to find a solution, and itrsquos looking asthe app will be sold off in a cut-price deal to Washingtonrsquos Microsoft. Initially this deal will only affect US operations, butthe British government continues its crackdown on Chinese tech companies , it seems likely the app will pass into Microsoftrsquos hands in the UK as well. Of course, only time will tellMicrosoft do a better job of managing TikTokrsquos PR issues, especially concerning childrens safety.FINLAY SCOTT"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-premiership-topped-premier-league-bundesliga-return-weekend","story":"Letrsquos be honest though, how many of you were actually that interested or did you just tune in to Augsburg vs Paderborn to get a football fix that had been absent for the best part of three months The Premier League comeback was met with increased interest in Scotland as punters actually had a relatively clued up understanding of the  players who were strutting their stuff on the park.Seeing Liverpool crowned champions was a welcome sight and the battle for relegation and Champions League spots also kept us entertained.But come on, nothing in Germany or England quite compared to theof the Scottish Premiership season did it I felt like a kid on Christmas Day waking up on Saturday morning.Aberdeen vs Rangers on the telly for starters, a trip to Tannadice for Dundee United vs St Johnstone as a main course, and Sportscenefor dessert.Donrsquot get me wrong, I was in an extremely privileged position to be able to go and watch a match in a stadium and I know thousands of others would have paid good money to be in my shoes. But it was just that sense of familiarity that was oh-so welcome.I would have happily handed over my pay-per-view fee to have Scottish football back on my TVI wasnrsquot in a position to go along to a game too.And going by the reaction of supporters on social media, screenings from across the country seemed to go down without any major hiccups.Of course there are going to be teething problems and it will probably take some of Scotlandrsquos top flight teams a few weeks before they are churning out industry standard streams ndash but remember these are unprecedented times for everyone.I have to tip my hat to Dundee United too. The Terrors were extremely well organised and made a potentially nerve wracking experience stress free for those of us who were lucky enough to take in their first game back in the Premiership.They would have loved the stands to be full of adoring supporters for the unfurling of the Championship winners flag, but with the stadium decorated in tangerine flags and supporter cutouts, they certainly made the best out of a bad situation.As much as it was great to be back at a live game, the lack of fans was the one big disappointment and I believe it certainly had an impact on those out on the pitch.United played against the  men of St Johnstone for the best part of  minutes on Saturday and threatened Elliott Parish in the Saints goal only once.If the stands had been packed with Tannadice followers urging their team on to attack, it could have quite easily been an opening day three points for Micky Mellonrsquos side.Therersquos talk of it being September before supporters are able toto their seats in stadiums across Scotland, albeit in reduced numbers.In my opinion this stage, with empty stadia, could have both positive and negative effects on teams.Dundee United, as previously mentioned, are a prime example of the way a lack of supporters can have a negative impact.But for a team like Rangers, I think an empty Ibrox for the opening period of the season could work as an advantage.Nobody can disagree that it takes a special player to perform week in week out in front of , and in recent seasons some Gers players have been guilty of finding that pressure too much.In contrast, having no one in the stands, players can focus fully on the job in hand ndash getting three points on the board week in week out.Consistency will grow confidence and when the time comes for supporters to make their way back through the Ibrox turnstiles, players should not find the weight of expectancy as heavy as usual.Only time will tellsupporter absence will play a key role in deciding where the title ends up this season, but letrsquos just take a minute to appreciate that our game is back.The league we love and adore, the teams we, in normal circumstances, would follow across the country every week are back on our screens.There was pressure on the Scottish game last weekend to get it right after a summer of squabbling between clubs and the SPFL about how the season was ended.It featured on our televisions and computer screens almost as much as the pandemic we are experiencing.But again I will reiterate, nobody has experienced anything like this before and cut-throat decisions had to be made.Those at the top got it right at the weekend and we must continue to showcase football in Scotland in the best possible way moving forward.The Scottish Premiership is one of the few leagues running at the moment and with an operational pay-per-view service and Sky Sports on our side - it is time to show the rest of Europe what we are all about.The talent is there and a captive audience is here now more than ever.You simply cannae beat it. Itrsquos great to have you back Scottish football."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-andrew-mckie-dont-know-future-lies-doubt-giffnock","story":"All this was stale potatoes by the s. But no amount of immersion in JG Ballard, Philip K Dick and William Gibson could have prepared me for rsquos latest bombshell: the news that Gfnock has just squeezed out Kirkintilloch as the UKrsquos most desirable place to live.ldquoCome off it, as Irsquom sure John W Campbell, editor of Astounding Science Fiction, would have said. ldquoShape-shting telepathic poker-playing vugs from Titan invading the Earth, fair enough. Gfnock  No one would believe that.:Kirkintilloch and Gfnock named best commuter places to liveI donrsquot intend to malign Gfnock . I would have been almost as surprisedthe result had been Clarkston or Newton Mearns. But the coronavirus crisis has shted perceptions and priorities and, according to the property firm behind this study, previously desirable attributes such as air quality, open spaces and residentsrsquo happiness have now to be measured against broadband speed and ease of home working.According to those who said that lockdown had changed their priorities,  per cent were more likely to want a garden. Thatrsquos maybe not very surprising, especially after a period when many people could go out only briefly to exercise or shop, and later, could meet limited numbers of people, but only outside.To take another example, one barbecue manufacturer reports recent sales increases of  per cent, which suggests that those who have gardens are using them more, while Amazon recently had to recall a barbecue sold for use on the balconies of blocks of flats over safety concerns, which indicates the limitations of more cramped outdoor space.As with so many property fantasies, I suspect that the participants in this survey are romanticising the idea of a garden, or Gfnock. Growing your own vegetables, building a pizza oven, installing a trampoline or keeping hens are certainly all things that can be done in a garden, but are more of a challenge up a wally close. But theyrsquore all also things that require work and effort and which a lot of people get tired of fairly quickly.The experience of those who have been working from home, rather than going into an office in a city centre or on an urban business park, may have sparked the idea that theyrsquod like to commute a bit less, but it doesnrsquot seem to have persuaded them that itrsquos possible to work entirely from home.If there were a genuine conviction, among either employees or employers, that working from home were to become the norm, surveys such as this one would not focus on commutable areas, still less find their top spots occupied by suburbs. Gfnock may technically be a town, but it s as a suburb .Like the suburbs themselves, working from home may not be as transformative as all that, but rather a sort of halfway house. The question is whether, in the aftermath of coronavirus, being in easy reach of a city centre, but in a nice house with a fair-sized garden, in a quiet area with good schools and excellent broadband, will offer as many advantages as people currently seem to think it will.If office workers can work almost as easily from their own dining rooms, theyrsquove also discovered that they can do their shopping just as easily from there. Online sales across Europe were growing by  per cent in April even after the reopening of some shops, they remained up  per cent on the same time in the previous year. Andyou donrsquot have to commute to a city to work, why would you need to live all that near one at all The answer might have been shops, or restaurants, or leisure facilities, or entertainment venues. But these are the very things that,they are not already closed down for health reasons, are gravely endangered for economic ones.Cities, which have historically been the mark of civilisation and increased wealth, are still overwhelmingly the destination for that portion of the global population seeking to improve their circumstances. Forty years ago, less than  per cent of Chinarsquos population lived in urban areas itrsquos now more than  per cent, and that period exactly matches the countryrsquos economic growth.But in the developed world, or perhaps the digital world, the traditional purpose of the city is less clear, especially with the decline of labour-intensive manufacturing in the West. Automation in factories and the fact that service industries are largely conducted inside computer networks leave retail and hospitality businesses, cultural sites and entertainment as their main assets.Until now, suburbiarsquos main contribution to those fields has been to supply a steady stream of young people so bored by theirdistance from the action that they canrsquot wait to get into the big city.Now that the UKrsquos cities are emptying, and the bright lights are found on YouTube, Instagram or Spoty, itrsquos hard to see why yoursquod want to be in a city, let alone just quite near one. If it offers no good pleasure, as Mrs Brutus put it, why be reduced to dwelling even in its suburbs Itrsquos possible,for most of us unrealistic, to see the appeal of a rural smallholding. Itrsquos easy, for the dynamic, to see the appeal of a bustling metropolis. Butthe metropolis is empty and therersquos no broadband in the wilderness, the suburbs may not be the best of both worlds, but merely the least terrible option. Perhaps Gfnockrsquos triumph is a sign that our future homes will be, like Gertrude Steinrsquos Oakland suburbs, in places where therersquos no ldquothere there.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Mr Findlay goes on to state that many of the SNPs policies have failed since taking office. Presumably he also blames the gullible public for ing the SNP to Holyrood three consecutive times, andthe opinion polls are correct it will be back for a fourth term next May. However, I seem to recall that before the SNP came to power I had to pay over the counter for my medical prescriptions and pay to cross a bridge when visiting my friends in Fe. Amongst many other achievements, the SNP has provided baby boxes to help parents give their children a good start in le, extended quality childcare provision, upgraded nearly a thousand schools, provided free university education, built thousands of affordable homes for families, and provided free personal care when required, regardless of age.As for Mr Findlays contention that an independent Scotland would have no influence in the world compared to that of the UK, I would suggest that the UKs standing in the world has slumped due to leaving the European Union, a decision which was soundly rejected by Scotlands voters.

A line has been crossed since Brexit. The Union as it is now is no longer viable. It has become a focus of discontent as Scotland is shoe-horned into a new UK internal market replacing the EU single market.There is another way. Over the past couple of years there has been talk in Unionist circles of a new Act of Union to cement the new post-Brexit relationship. The Prime Minister is thought to be interested in something dramatic that would redefine relationships in this ldquoawesome foursome, as he calls Britain.The unionist columnist Stephen Daisley put flesh on the bones in an article this week. This new Act of Union would, in his model, restore the sovereignty of Westminster in a unitary UK state.

This could be a golden opportunity to re-establish equal delivery costs for islanders –the Chancellor will take these calls seriously.“Almost every family in the Highlands and Islands, myself included, has a story about being overcharged for deliveries. In some cases delivery costs can be even higher than the product itself. Unreasonable charges are a barrier to growth and ease of living. This has to change.”He continued: “Delivery charge inequality affects communities represented by a wide range of parties, from Moray to Unst to Belfast.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not having the energy they need makes nerves vulnerable to further damage and causes disability over time.Orkney is understood to have the highest rate of MS per capita of anywhere in the world.Researchers—  funded in part by the MS Society – have discovered a natural mechanism in the body that tackles this issue, which they are calling ARMD .The study also suggests that a common diabetes drug could help enhance this new-found natural mechanism – and prevent disability progression in the neurological condition. Although this naturalalone doesn’t provide enough energy to address demyelination in MS, further research in animal models now suggests that pioglitazone –  a drug currently used to treat diabetes – could be the answer. Dr Don Mahad, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Disability in MS is caused by a loss of nerve fibres following damage to the myelin that protects them. #Although our understanding of MS has vastly improved over the last two decades, new therapies still do not protect nerve fibres. Such protection is the Holy Grail in MS treatment — not only for the relapsing form of MS, which has ious options available, but for progressive forms too, where treatment continues to lag behind. “Our discovery shows that nerves respond to myelin damage by increasing the movement of mitochondriato the area of damage — a response we’re calling ‘ARMD’. #Remarkably, we were able to enhance ARMD and protect these vulnerable nerves using the readily available diabetes drug pioglitazone. This is an incredibly important discovery – one we believe could finally bridge the gap in MS treatment.” Over the last few decades there have been huge strides made in our understanding of MS, and there are now over a dozen effective treatments for people with relapsing MS — but these only address damage that is caused by the immune system. In order to truly stop MS and find treatments for everyone, a method of protecting nerves from further injury and repairing damaged myelin needs to be discovered.Last year, another MS Society funded study found that a dferent diabetes drug — the fasting mimetic drug metformin —was able tocells to a more youthful state, and encourage the re-growth of myelin. Led by Professor Robin Franklin, the study found metformin could reverse changes that happen to cells responsible for making myelin as they age, and restore their regenerative capacity. MS Society assistant director of research, Dr Emma Gray, said: “This represents another important stride towards our goal of stopping MS — and we believe that MS treatment could in the near future look completely dferent. #People with MS will be prescribed a combination of therapies that work on every aspect of the condition: stopping immune attacks and relapses, protecting nerves from damage, and regenerating lost myelin. It will mean no-one needs to worry about their MS getting worse.“Currently, there are no effective neuroprotective therapies available for MS, but Dr Mahad’s research demonstrates we are getting closer – and finding treatments for everyone with MS is now a very real prospect.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SQA then checked and validated the information received. According to the council, moderations to the results, up or down, have been made by the SQA,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and consistency with results from previous years.Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC education, leisure and housing committee said that all had stepped up to the challenges set before them during these unprecedented times.“Never before have the exams been cancelled, so it has been a steep learning curve for all involved and we must acknowledge the efforts of our teaching staff here in Orkney in making these dficult decisions — it is not easy when you know you are playing a part in determining the onward learning journey of students.#But teachers and lecturers are best placed to have a strong understanding of how their learners have performed and, based on their experience and the evidence available, what a learner would be expected to achieve in each course. I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study. We are pleased that the overall pass rate across Orkney’s schools remains strong at  per cent – the same as last year’s pass rate.“When schools and college stafffrom the summer holiday detailed analysis of the results will take place, subject by subject, enabling the Council to evaluate trends, build on success and establish where any improvements may be needed.#We remain committed to assist in whatever way we can in helping all students move forward into positive destinations.”Kirkwall Grammar School head teacher, Don Hawkins, expressed his pride a the quality and amount of work carried out by staff to ensure the best possible outcomes for the young people of KGS.He said: “This can also be a time of incredible pressure for our young people and for some this will be a period of extreme anxiety, especiallytheir grades don#t match up to their expectations or hopes.“My message to all young people is that there is no one pathway.  No one’s journey will be exactly what they hoped for.  Congratulations on your success andthe results are not what you had wished, pick yourself up and try again.  As someone once said ‘there is no disgrace in being knocked down, there is only shame in not getting back up never quit!’.#Your parents and teachers will be there to provide you with the support and guidance you need to adapt the plan your pathway going forward.#Orkney schools and other local organisations are on hand to help pupils who are concerned about their exam results, or who just want some advice on what to do next.

It does have to depend on the facts of the case and thatrsquos why the local director of public health will be responsible for the response to that spike.Pressed on whether schools should be the last to close, he said: ldquoWhat Irsquom saying is that all children will be ing to school in September, including in those areas that are currently subject to a local lockdown ndash Manchester, Greater Manchester, Leicester and so on ndash because it is important children are back in school.ldquoBut you canrsquot decree this for every single case and it will depend on the circumstances of a local increase in the infection rate, and that is why it is being led by the director of public health in localities. But we want all children back in school.Professor Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the decision to impose the lockdown, suggested ministers would need to ldquorow back on the relaxation of restrictions, such as in social and leisure venues and with increased working from home, to allow a full-timeto schools. colleges, link lots of households together, reconnect the social network which social distancing measures have deliberately disconnected\" data-source\"Professor Neil Ferguson\"He told Today: ldquoI mean that really is a policy decision, but Irsquom just saying, in my view, it is likely that some form of those measures will be necessary to maintain control of transmission.Prof Ferguson, whose advice continues to inform the Governmentrsquos response despite his resignation from the Sage advisory group, said there is some evidence that older teenagers transmit the virus just as effectively as adults.ldquoThe risk then is that big schools, comprehensives, universities, FEcolleges, link lots of households together, reconnect the social network which social distancing measures have deliberately disconnected. And that poses a real risk of amplication of transmission, of case numbers going up quite sharply, he said.Ms Longfield had earlier accused the Government of treating children ldquoas an afterthought during the Covid- crisis.In a briefing paper, she said keeping schools open should be the ldquoabsolute priority, adding: ldquoEducation should be prioritised over other sectors: first to open, last to close.ldquoWhen only a limited amount of social interaction is feasible, the amount accounted for by education must be protected ndash at the expense of other sectors activities.Labour was unequivocal in backing Ms Longfieldrsquos demand, with leader Sir Keir Starmer warning Mr Johnson he has only a month to fix the test and trace programme to prevent a resurgence in outbreaks. vw,vw,px, px\"ldquoWe were promised a world-beating system, we havenrsquot got it. So wersquore saying to the Government very clearly today, time is running out, Sir Keir said during a visit to Stoke.ldquoSchools must be the priority and we certainly support the call that schools should be the last to close.In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon appeared to take action to prioritise schools when she ordered bars, cafes and restaurants to close in Aberdeen as an outbreak of  new cases prompted ato lockdown restrictions.ldquoActing now, we judge, gives us the time and the space to protect the ability of our young people toto education, she said.Meanwhile, an influential cross-party committee of MPs blamed the Governmentrsquos earlier failure to quarantine travellers arriving in the UK for having ldquoaccelerated the spread of Covid-.The report by the Commons Home Affairs Committee was scathing of the ldquoinexplicable decision to lt all border restrictions in March, which they say led to ldquomany more people contracting Covid-.Figures published by the UKrsquos statistics agencies show there have now been , deaths registered in the UK where Covid- was mentioned on the death certicate.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/web-banner-1.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most ReadFormer UTV presenter Brian Black dies after car plunges into water at Strangford#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittA special man: Tributes to TV presenter Brian Black after car plunge tragedyBar closed for deep clean after outbreak of Covid- in Co DownDUP MLA Joanne Bunting charged with careless driving and leaving scene of accident,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the time, the Troubles, as we came to know them, had scarcely begun. I wanted to persuade Frank, with John#s help, that international media had begun taking an interest in NI and the commentary was almost unormly sympathetic to the nationalist cause.I then hoped Frank would impress on his Republican colleagues the fact that suitcase bombs going off in streets would surely destroy this image.John demurred a little at first, saying that he always found that once he succeeded in convincing an IRA man to rely on dialogue not bombs, a harder one in the IRA circle would convince him otherwise. .textContentembedUrl +  dart_gs_channels +  catchconst el  documentel.async  trueel.src  embedUrldocument.getElementByIdChildYet he agreed to accompany me, but first he had to speak with a constituent in Derry.When we eventually got to Convoy, Frank was nowhere to be found. His more-than-hospitable we, however, suggested we spend the night at their home.However, John and I had to share the same bed.At the enormous breakfast which she provided the next morning, Mrs Morris ribbed us both, inquiring of John: What were you two fellas doing last night John looked at her from two heavily pouched eyes - into each one you could have poured a glass of brandy - and replied in heavily accented Derry: Shleep.With nothing to show for our efforts, we disconsolately headed back to Derry. John received a call that we should visit Ivan Cooper#s house.Read More Biden and Pompeo pay tribute to John Hume John Hume: How political icon#s death was reported John Hume family ask public to light candle for peaceOn arrival we found Ivan standing beside the wreckage of his car which had been blown up overnight.John posed for pictures taken by the BBC. Constituency work, Derry style!A few years later, John got another call offering another possible peace idend.It would involve going to Frankfurt to meet an Irish American politician called Ted Kennedy.John borrowed the money for the fare, and set off to commence what turned out to be one of the most valuable relationships of his rich career.Like Convoy, the visit could have ended fruitlessly, but at least he would have tried.His pursuit of peace led him to the realisation that achieving it would ultimately have to hurt those he loved - the membership of his own SDLP party which he helped found and came to dominate.When Fr Alec Reid began his subterranean peace efforts, putting political opponents in touch with each other John agreed to meet with Gerry Adams and continued to do so even though the initial talks foundered disastrously John discovered that the Provisionals intended to photograph the interview.When it came in , the conferring of the Nobel Prize on John was no more than his just reward.By the time the Good Friday Agreement era dawned, he was almost burnt out.His exertions: the late nights, the political strain of dealing with Dublin, Belfast, London and Washington, the indignities of age, all took a heavy toll, but John by now had won not only the ear and trust of the Kennedys but also of Bill Clinton.He helped to bring the agreement to birth and it is a commentary on the inadequacy of Unionist philosophy that his opponents did not wholeheartedly embrace bringing that infant to a state of healthy adulthood.His legacy is such that - in Ireland, America, and the UK - those who dealt with John Hume will forever honour his memory.Here was a Caesar!

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

Banagher defeated their neighbours in the  and  semi-finals before going down to Slaughtneil. The Lynchs have brought through a host of new players in the intervening years from their Ulster minor winning teams and have went toe to toe with the Emmets in the last two seasons. Geoffrey McGonigle has added to his management team. Former Dunloy goalkeeper Shane Elliott and Ryan ONeill join Ronan McCloskey in the setup. In a change to their team structure, Derry goalkeeper Sean Kelly played outfield last season but he has replaced BJ Lagan between the posts. googletag.cmd.push In the first round this season, they were - to - ahead against Swatragh and were cruising but failed to match the Swatragh workrate before losing their stranglehold of the game. In their game, Banagher led Coleraine by five points after the first quarter but it was the visitors to Fr McNally Park who took control. Darragh Cartins last gasp free earned them a draw but Banaghers body language told a story of dejection. The one thing that will raise them will be the sight of the Kevin Lynchs jersey and local bragging rights is everything. They met in the league last season and it was hell for leather. googletag.cmd.push Selector Ronan McCloskey stated after the Swatragh game that his side had plenty to improve on and they will be keen to put the record straight. In the other game in the section, all is to play for as Swatragh take on Coleraine, two teams who will have taken a lot out of their first round outings. For Coleraine manager Brendan McNicholl, it will be about assessing who all is available after last weekends football championship. It was touch and gothey would even get a team to play Banagher, such is their limited squad. They were minus Ruairi Mooney, Liam and Barry McGoldrick. Swatragh were upbeat after their spirited display in the Kevin Lynch Park monsoon but Declan McGuckin and Seamus Bradley will need to address their poor start that left them with a mountain to climb. They will need to get more scores from open playthey are to see off Coleraine. In the other group, merciless Slaughtneil take on Lavey where a win would seal a semi-final berth and allow breathing space during a hectic period for dual players. Gerald Bradley didnt start against Screen and could come into contention, but Michael McShane will be without Karl McKaigue following his Achilles tendon injury. The champions will have to plan without the suspended Jerome McGuigan but they have plenty more in reserve. Liam Cassidy, Prionsias Burke, Cormac McKenna and minor star Shea Cassidy could all come into the selection thoughts. Lavey lost Ryan Mulholland with broken fingers in their win over Na Magha and will need to offer more in front of the posts, with Johnny McGarveys side hitting close to  wides in their opener. Fintan Bradley, Paddy Henry and Ciaran Hendry were their scorers, but its hard to see them getting anything from this game. Ballinascreen manager Cathal McDaid will be looking for a reaction from his sides heavy defeat at Emmet Park to take into their clash with Na Magha. They will take positives with the appetite shown in the opening  minutes and how the use of Martin Mulgrews short puck-outs worked. Paul Cleary is carrying all their scoring threat and that will be a concern. Na Magha, minus Alan Grant, stuck with Lavey every step of the way and they will be keen to build on that as they strive to break away from their tag as a junior team. A win for Ballinascreen could setup a showdown with Lavey in Round , where the winner would advance to the senior semi-finals. The top two teams from each section will advance to the senior semi-finals, where the losers will play in the intermediate final. The bottom two teams in each group will make up the junior championship semi-finals.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The figure was outlined in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the local harbour.While the key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, they also examined improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.The consultants also undertook a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computer modelling.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas, including the fish dock within the southpier. In August last year, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group set up to oversee the regeneration of the port.Cllr Curran says there are plans to deepen the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.He said consideration is also being given to creating a pontoon with finger berths adjacent to the quay wall and gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.ldquoNew investment in Ardglass harbour can help sustain existing jobs and create new employment opportunities, said Cllr Curran. ldquoThe port plays a key part in the local economy and is at the heart of village le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Couple who met at school enjoy 50th wedding anniversary  ","story":"A LOCAL couple who met at school and whose love grew at a church youth group have recently celebrated th years of marriage.Jim and Angela Wilson marked their golden anniversary with a family party with their three sons and their wives and nine grandchildren.The Saintfield couple, who now live in Comber, married on July ,  at Saintfield Parish Church and honeymooned, like many others of their generation, at home.Angela was just  and Jim  when they got married but despite their tender years starting off married le, the happy couple wouldnrsquot turn the clock back.Retired motor mechanic Jim said: ldquoWe met at Saintfield High School and used to go the local youth club, I was in the BB and Angela was in the GB.

But just before half-time a breakaway move left the home defence breached and this was capitalised on as Gilmore fired to the net leaving a goal in it at the break.On the restart the Hoops introduced Tim Prenter and Jarlath Brannigan to add a bit of spark, but it was St Johnrsquos who raised the first flag before Gerdie Collins pointed and Peter Turley brought things level with a marauding goal.St Johnrsquos wouldnrsquot give in, despite playing against the breeze, and again went in front with a point before losing a man to a black card.Conor McGrady and Jarlath Brannigan nosed the Hoops in front before Chis McKay added a final score of the game for St Johnrsquos.RGU upped their game massively in the final  minutes and points from McGradyRuairi Quinn and Johnnie Bell and a Conor McGrady goal saw them home by - to -.The scoreline may have been a bit flattering, but it was a deserved win all the same given the horrendous night.There were some impressive personal performances, no more so than Conor McGrady with a personal tally of -, but Chris Magee impressed over the hour alongside Ronan Murphy, Nathan McShane and Eoin Rooney.This week the RGU travel to Annaclone.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care home.Residents say while this section of road is governed by a mph limit, very few drivers adhere to it with the speed of many vehicles which use the road described as ldquofrightening.PSNI traffic officers are periodically deployed to the Strangford Road and while their presence is welcomed, residents believe thatthe new speed indicator sign needs to be relocatedis to be effective.Last week, a call was issued to Downpatrick area councillors to meet with PCSP officials to discuss the location of the speed indicator sign and press for it to be moved back as far as the entrance to Lecale Park.Residents say that speeding has been a major issue along the Strangford Road for many years and that there have been several accidents. Concern has also been expressed about the safety of pedestrians who walk in this popular area.Some Strangford Road residents say they cannot understand why the new speed indicator sign is policing just a short section of one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads and has not been placed ahead of the approach to a number of large housing areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Murlough club celebrates  ","story":"MURLOUGH ACrsquos annual awards night was very dferent this year.Prize winners were presented with their awards on Saturday at a less formal and socially distanced outdoors event.It was a great way for them to celebrate the running achievements of everyone from   before lockdown occurred.The award winners have shown commitment to their running and to the club in the respective categories.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11641126.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With free admission to NHS health workers and an extensive ‘Customer Confidence Charter’ in line with the World Health Organisation and Government advice, Titanic Belfast reopened to the public at the weekend.The multi award-winning, world-class experience’s first official visitor since it closed due to Covid- in March was Belfast’s First Citizen, the Right Honourable, the Lord Mayor, Councillor Frank McCoubrey. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Knotted rope on the floor shows the way around Boomtown BelfastAs part of its wide-ranging Customer Confidence Charter there’s an extremely user-friendly, one-way route vividly marked on the floor, artwork which wonderfully illustrates Belfast’s unique history whilst maintaining social distancing. Without missing a single historic detail, the floor-markings lead visitors through a series of themed areas.Boomtown Belfast is all about the city’s burgeoning industrial past and the marking on the floor is a thick, knotted rope.In times past, when the city’s manufacturing dexterity was at its peak, it was said that every sailor, of whatever nationality, sailing whichever ocean, worked with ropes that were made in Belfast. Titanic BelfastTramlines on the floor guide visitors through the shipyard exhibits, evocative of the days when Harland and Wolff not only built ships, but trains that were exported all over the globe, as well as having its own, vast railway system beside the Lagan, and trams, steam-cranes, buses, ferries and a fleet of taxis!Unmistakable white and red White Star Line flags and logos mark the route through Titanic’s Launch, Fit-Out and Maiden Voyage, with floor directions to The Sinking marked by her final Morse-code call-sign, repeated urgently, as it was when Titanic foundered. CQD - Come Quickly Danger - dash, dot, dash, dot dash, dash, dot, dash dash, dot, dot.There are ‘jump out’ circles and interactive zones along the way where visitors can pause and ‘delve a little deeper’ - maybe tap out the tragic Morse code, or take the amazing Arrol Gantry ride, or glance through a window at a yellow HW crane, or make use of the ubiquitous hand sanitising facilities. Face coverings were advisablenot mandatoryThe route to, and around, Titanic’s replica leboat is indicated on the floor with some of the heartrending newspaper headlines that followed her sinking - Her Side Ripped as by a Giant Can Opener, Great Loss of Le, Officers Sank with Titanic and , Die. Navigational markings and compass points on the floor indicate the route through Titanic Belfast’s modern-times narrative, explaining how the great ship has captured the world’s imagination, how the wreck was discovered and exploring the depths of the Atlantic where Titanic lies today. A le-size model of a deep-sea er from the Titanic era, with air-pipes connected to his thick brass helmet,shows that face coverings are advisable,not mandatory, but as I went outside to visit the Nomadic a line of pigeons perched on the roof of Lord Pirie’s former living quarters weren’t properly socially distanced!In addition to Titanic Belfast’s one-way, self-guided themed tour and Family Trail, visitors will be able to experience its award-winning outdoor Discovery Tour, Titanic Foundation’s Out of Stores Exhibition and its new Maritime Mile Treasure Trail.It will be accepting pre-bookings only and operating on a reduced capacity to allow for physical distancing.

It does have to depend on the facts of the case and thatrsquos why the local director of public health will be responsible for the response to that spike.Pressed on whether schools should be the last to close, he said: ldquoWhat Irsquom saying is that all children will be ing to school in September, including in those areas that are currently subject to a local lockdown ndash Manchester, Greater Manchester, Leicester and so on ndash because it is important children are back in school.ldquoBut you canrsquot decree this for every single case and it will depend on the circumstances of a local increase in the infection rate, and that is why it is being led by the director of public health in localities.
