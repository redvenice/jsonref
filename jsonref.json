Unproven and often dubious economic benefits are no replacement for dismantling farming communities that were built over generations.\u0027Then there is the question of whether removing sheep from upland areas will actually increase bioersity, as Mr Monbiot and others claim.A long-running scientific study at Moor House, a nature reserve in Upper Teesdale where large areas were fenced to keep sheep out around 65 years ago, has identified very little increase in vegetation, and no significant growth in animal populations.Other studies raise further questions about rewilding. In 2014, a team led by Cibele Queiroz of Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden reviewed 276 studies on the effect of farmland being abandoned. It found that while some areas saw an increase in bioersity, most did not.This is because landscapes farmed in traditional ways (as opposed to intensively) create a wide variety of habitats that animals love, from grassland to hedgerows. When farming stops, those habitats can disappear.         One fan is Henry Dimbleby — son of broadcaster David and co-founder of restaurant chain Leon — who runs the country\u0027s National Food Strategy. Mr Dimbleby told farmers in November last year that \u0027an area of the UK the size of East Anglia does need to be planted with trees for rewilding\u0027For example, the study explains, the Coa valley in Portugal was once used for small-scale cattle and pig farming and foraging, creating a mosaic of habitats, supporting lynx and eagles.But farming there ceased, and the valley has been choked with scrub and forest, with the constant threat of wildfires.In Japan, where rice farming is in severe decline as the population falls and people switch to wheat, abandoned paddies get choked with vines and bamboo.Over past 15 years, that has caused a steady decline in insects, birds, amphibians and plants. (Supporters of rewilding argue \u0027abandonment\u0027 is very different from the stewardship involved in well-run projects.)In any case, argue critics, large-scale rewilding — taking substantial areas of farmland out of food production — will leave Britain either needing to import more food or to farm remaining land more intensively. Neither option seems environmentally friendly.Rewilding Britain insists, for its part, that it only aspires to stop farming on a small portion of our countryside.\u0027Less than one per cent of the UK is currently rewilded and 70 per cent is farmland,\u0027 says Alistair Driver, Rewilding Britain\u0027s director.\u0027We only have ambitions to reach around five per cent by 2100. This isn\u0027t going to make a huge impact on food supply.\u0027So can the two sides in this increasingly rancorous debate reach a compromise?The omens are not good. In Holland, moves to carry out an annual cull of large mammals on the Oostvaardersplassen — to stop so many from starving to death — were unveiled by the government in 2018, only to be attacked by animal rights groups who want the creatures relocated.Even now, lawyers are fighting it out in court.Few believe it will be the last battle fought over rewilding."},{"url":null,"title":"How Prince Andrews ex Amanda Staveley brought investors Middle East save Barclays","story":"Share this article          The case is due to start later this year and it is believed further damaging revelations will emerge about the culture at the bank at the time.

Campaigners claim that the US practice of giving chicken a chlorinated wash to remove harmful bacteria can compensate for poor hygiene and welfare standards on farms, allowing American producers to undercut their rivals.Minette Batters, from farming union NFU, warned this week that ‘opening our ports, shelves and fridges to food which would be illegal to produce here would not only be morally bankrupt, it would be the work of the insane’.Environment minister Zac Goldsmith said Mrs Batters was right about the principles but wrong about the Government’s policy.‘To impose high standards on our farmers, only to undercut them with low standard imports would be wrong on every level, and there is no argument about that,’ Lord Goldsmith said.But Government sources last night cautioned that ministers were not proposing a blanket ban on cheap American food.One pointed out that, while the Tory manifesto talked about ‘safeguarding high standards of animal welfare’ in any deal, it was silent on issues such as genetically-modified crops, which are produced on an industrial scale in the US.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is said to have underlined the importance of removing barriers to its farm produce during talks with Miss Truss earlier this week.

But they remain far apart on key issues, including legal oversight, fishing and the EU’s demand that Britain should continue to follow its rules after the transition period expires at the end of this year.And the agenda revealed they cannot even agree on terminology – with the EU demanding talks on a ‘level playing field’, while the UK refers to ‘open and fair competition’. But it was agreed that the talks will be conducted in English, with Brussels agreeing to pay translation costs if Mr Barnier wishes to speak in French.Talks will alternate between Brussels and London, with five rounds pencilled in ahead of a ‘high-level summit’ in June when Mr Johnson will decide if it is worth continuing with them.But France’s Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin warned yesterday: ‘We cannot let our level of ambition be affected by what I would call artificial deadlines.

But, ahead of a Tate Britain show, we look at the pictures that were deemed just too outrageous. WARNING: explicit contentA woman who is naked except for fancy stockings touches what the artist calls her “coynte” while a winged cupid teases her bottom with a powder puff. A wizened man admires a young man’s elephantine erection, the glans as big as his bald head – all delineated in sharp black outlines and shadowed with inky pools against expanses of white. These are a few of the many explosions of obscenity that a slender, pale young man created in the room he checked into at the Spread Eagle hotel in Epsom, Surrey, in June 1896.The drawings Aubrey Beardsley completed in this suburban hideaway were to illustrate the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes. The works, that can be perused at your leisure in Tate Britain’s forthcoming exhibition, had an incalculable effect on the birth of modern art. Beardsley’s eroticism would soon be emulated all over Europe by revolutionaries such as Klimt, Schiele and Picasso, while James Joyce summed up his impact on modernism in a double entendre: “Kunstfull”.That isn’t generally how this unique artist is remembered, though. Beardsley is pigeonholed as a preciously eccentric purveyor of late-Victorian erotica. Rediscovered in the 1960s, when both Victoriana and sex were fashionable, he hovers in the subconscious of British art. His name sounds posh, which adds to the air of whimsy, but he was born into an economically unstable lower-middle-class family in Brighton in 1872 and left school aged 16.Beardsley was an insurance clerk before being discovered by Oscar Wilde’s first male lover, Robert Ross. This led to an artistic collaboration with Wilde, but his importance goes far beyond the aesthetic movement. He put sexuality at the centre of modern art for the first time, spreading his influence across Europe – to Vienna, Paris and Barcelona – 25 years before surrealism.Then in 1895, a year before he settled in at the Spread Eagle, Beardsley’s world fell apart. Wilde was arrested and charged with gross indecency. The author’s love for Lord Alfred Douglas became a scandal and anyone associated with him was suspected of sodomy. Beardsley, at the age of 22, had been chosen by Wilde to illustrate the printed edition of his disturbing drama Salome. Following that success, he became art editor, designer and illustrator of the Yellow Book, a bestselling magazine that brought avant garde ideas into respectable homes. But when Wilde fell, its publisher John Lane sacked him. Beardsley had only recently been able to give up his day job. Now he was vilified and poverty-stricken.The poet WB Yeats, a friend of Beardsley, remembered him looking into a mirror shortly after being sacked and saying: “Yes, yes, I look like a sodomite ... but no, I am not that.” The man in the mirror was an exquisite dandy: when Beardsley became a star in 1890s London, he started wearing suits in subtly contrasting shades of grey with yellow gloves over his ethereally thin figure. Yet there is no evidence that he ever went to bed with anyone of any gender – except maybe, biographers speculate, his sister, Mabel.And here Mabel is, naked in a back room at Tate Britain. To get a sneak peak at Beardsley’s drawings, I’ve visited the museum’s Prints and Drawings Rooms. The frontispiece he designed for the collected plays of a now-forgotten writer rests on a wooden stand. Mabel Beardsley is the nude at the far left, with layers of radiating hair that look like they belong in a psychedelic poster. She is looking ecstatically at Wilde, who stands beside her dressed as the ancient wine god Bacchus. In front of them is a goat-legged faun.Sex is Beardsley’s theme and, unprovable allegations aside, it seems to have existed for him only on paper. That makes him an artist for our time. Long before the virtual and fluid sexualities of the 21st century, Beardsley created an erotic fantasy world of shifting identities and infinite variety. His art is one long act of self-pleasuring that reached its consummation on Epsom High Street.His most famous illustration for Wilde’s Salome is actually called The Climax. In this intense symbolist design, Salome has persuaded her stepfather, Herod, to have John the Baptist’s head cut off in return for gratifying his lust with an erotic dance. She can now satiate her own lust for the Baptist – or at least his lips. She floats in the air, seemingly with orgasmic joy, as black blood pours from the fetishised dead head she embraces.Does that seem an over-explicit interpretation of this great fin de siècle image? Well, you should see his rejected designs for Salome. Several scenes were deemed too dirty by the publisher and he was asked to replace them with milder versions. In his original drawing of The Toilet of Salome, a pageboy stands naked holding a tray of tea things. Another near-nude youth sits with his hand between his legs, masturbating as he gazes at the tray-carrier. Meanwhile, Salome also masturbates.Sex is all in the head. That is Beardsley’s message, and the basis of the strange game he played with Victorian censorship. The reason Salome first appeared in English as a book, rather than on stage, was because it was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain. Beardsley’s drawings mock the censor by dancing a fine line between innocence and depravity. The publisher accepted his vision of Salome’s love of a severed head, but rejected his drawing of her sitting with her back to us in a dressing gown that’s open. What was the problem? She holds a conductor’s baton.Before he got sacked from the Yellow Book, Beardsley filled the widely read magazine with similar suggestiveness. His illustration A Night Piece shows a woman in a long black dress and gloves and a thin black ribbon round her white throat walking down a dark city street – she is, in Victorian parlance, a woman of the night. In another picture, called L’Éducation Sentimentale, a young woman is listening attentively to her older friend. Both have tough, pinched faces. It’s not a sentimental but a sexual education set in a brothel.Beardsley pictured his audience as young women. On the cover he designed for the Yellow Book’s publicity leaflet, his imagined female reader studies the latest volumes outside a bookshop. She looks rapt, for Beardsley depicts reading itself as the most subversive of pleasures. In his revised version of The Toilet of Salome, she has Émile Zola’s novel Nana on her bookshelves – a “dirty French novel”, as Lou Reed would later put it. The Yellow Book was yellow to evoke the typical covers of sexy French fiction. Wilde wrote Salome in French, intoxicated by the writings of Flaubert, Huysmans and Baudelaire. Beardsley was equally au fait, regularly taking the boat train to Paris. French artists loved him back: Toulouse-Lautrec ordered three copies of his illustrated Salome.When Beardsley checked in to the Spread Eagle hotel, he’d just come back from Brussels, another capital of fin de siècle culture. There he probably encountered the explicit art of Félicien Rops, including his 1878 gouache Pornocrates, in which a pig is held on a leash by a naked woman wearing a blindfold and black stockings. On the way back from the Belgian capital, Beardsley fell seriously ill. It was to get out of London’s smog that he fled to Epsom. He had known since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was seven years old that his life would be limited. In the two years following his stay in Epsom, he would travel to France in search of better health, dying at Menton on the Riviera in 1898, aged 25.As his young life entered its premature twilight, he found sensual solace in Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, a play about love defeating death – or, in Greek, Eros defeating Thanatos. Aristophanes wrote it during a murderous war between Athens and Sparta that seemed to have no end. He imagines the women of both cities refusing to have sex with their husbands to stop the war. Beardsley turns this sex strike into an orgiastic triumph of lust over despair. Even as they listen to a speech, his Greek women can’t stop fondling each other. A Spartan woman gleefully taunts her lust-crippled husband with her body. Men gather in a mass display of monumental members.We tend to analyse erotic art in terms of power, but for Beardsley it was quite simply a matter of life and death.• Aubrey Beardsley is at Tate Britain, London, 4 March to 25 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0082ad7c3efeca1539f349b5c32d10fe4b1ad547/0_762_12150_7290/master/12150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fcf5d688a2b4a286cffadd4f1205ec5","title":"own a guardian classic photograph abandoned car peak district 1979","story":"This week’s photograph in our weekly archive print series is a wintry image of a Mini abandoned in the snow and surrounded by sheep, shot by Don McPheeA Mini appears to have careered off the road and been abandoned in heavy snow near Buxton, in Derbyshire.  photographer Don McPhee captured the image in January 1979.

From the Americas (I think of Gabriel García Márquez’s Living to Tell the Tale) to Africa (Aida Edemariam’s beautiful The Wife’s Tale), in an era of renewed identity politics, many wish to engage with the inter-generational connections that skip the parents.Freeman’s focus – initiated by finding a burnished red shoebox stuffed with papers and secrets – was originally on her father’s mother, born as Sala Glahs in 1910 in Chrzanow, a small town of the Austro-Hungarian empire, not so far from Kraków. She was one of four siblings, and the intertwining of the life of Sala – who later became Sara – with that of her three older brothers encouraged Freeman to broaden her attention. The challenge for the structure and direction of a book such as this is obvious: family lives, as well as the discovery of the details, tend not to be linear.“When I became an adult, I suddenly couldn’t stop thinking of them,” Freeman, a,  journalist, explains. Many will know that feeling, the persistence of regret, of not having had a certain conversation, or asked a particular question.There is a singular form of communication that exists between grandchild and grandparent, not necessarily in a spoken form. It was finely explored by Maria Torok and Nicolas Abraham, two Hungarian psychoanalysts who sought to understand how secrets skip a generation and are transmitted from the first to the third generation. “What haunts are not the dead,” they concluded, “but the gaps left within us by the secrets of others.”The writer sets out to know who they are, and who she is. The reader is intrigued by the tales because they offer a way better to understand the gaps in their own life. There is also the question: what would I have done in times of brutal upheaval? Give me a grandparent, it might be said, and I will tell you about the grandchild.Sala was part of the generation of Ostjuden – eastern Jews – who headed west following the upheavals of the first world war, including pogroms against the Jews. In the 1920s the four Glahs siblings headed to Paris, where they lived happily under the name Glass. The life of each followed a different path. Jehuda Henoch became Jules Henri Glass, married a woman with roots in Lwów, invented the Omniphot microfilming machine, set up his own company and became a successful businessman. The ill-fated Jakob became Jacques in May 1940, as the Germans approached Paris, he joined a regiment connected to the Foreign Legion, which happened to be the same one my Lwowian grandfather joined, based in Barcares on a beach in southwest France. He was taken prisoner, but returned to Paris where he dutifully registered as Jewish.The third brother, named Sender, became Alex Maguy, a successful couturier who worked with a young Christian Dior and would, in later life, become a gallery owner who hoped to hang out with Picasso, and then did.Sala became Sara. She met Bill Freiman, an American man of business and left for the US and marriage, which allowed her to escape the horrors that engulfed Europe. But her husband promised more than he delivered and she led, it seems, an emotionally unfulfilled life in a place that never quite felt like home. She lost her “easy-going” brother Jacques as well as her favourite cousin, Rose, in the Holocaust.Freeman traces the lives of the four siblings with elegance and humanity. She confronts the mysteries of life that cause four iniduals with a similar beginning to reach very different endpoints. Is it will, or fate, or chance, or something else? Such questions flow below the surface of the narrative. Occasionally they reach out with brutal force: could it be that death in an extermination camp is the price you pay for being decent and playing by the rules?The sibling who stands out is the one defined by the greatest ambiguities, at once attractive and repellent. Great uncle Alex – “small bald and tough like a bullet” – is recalled for the cabana he kept on the beach at Deauville, who, as his great niece records (with admirable clarity), was “suspected of collaboration” during the war, and of having associated with known collaborators after the war. Serge Lifar, for example, a former director of the Paris Opera Ballet, commissioned Alex to make costumes in the postwar years and so offered him a financial lifeline. In that period, Alex records in a personal reminiscence, “my real concern was to get my couture business relaunched”. This is delicate material, the dark side of a beloved family member.To Freeman’s credit, she lays the material out in a balanced way, allowing the reader to form their own view, not imposing her own. Alex’s “life-saving pragmatism took precedence over his loyalty to a greater cause”, she concludes, inviting the reader to go the extra mile in the case of such fascinating characters as Lifar (I was catalysed into a modest investigation of my own, and quickly found material that confirmed his brilliance and ghastliness: “Jewish culture is incompatible with omni-Aryan culture,” he wrote to the Commissariat Général aux Questions Juives, in an effort to save his own skin and stave off further inquiries as to his own heritage).To survive and to prosper may be a matter of chance and strategy. Does one go with the flow, and what if different flows pull in opposite directions? “How much of one’s ancestral identity must one give up to live in the modern world?”, Freeman asks. The question is pertinent once again, as matters of populism, nationalism and racism come to the fore. House of Glass is interspersed with Freeman’s own thoughts on matters of assimilation and social mobility. Past and present exist in a state of constant interaction, and this finely honed and engaging account draws the threads between then and now.• Philippe Sands’s The Ratline: Love, Lies and Justice on the Trail of a Nazi Fugitive is published in April by W\u0026ampN.

Every morning, the 87-year-old takes the two-minute stroll from his flat to a nearby basement office where his assistants help to keep the Blake empire ticking over. Last year, while walking to the office, he noticed a tiny weed growing in a crack between the pavement and the bottom of the garden railings. “Each day I came past it had got a little bit bigger,” he says. “I could show you exactly where it was. In the end, it had these little white flowers. It probably only lasted three weeks, but I thought to myself: ‘Ah.’”The expired plant is now immortalised in The Weed, Blake’s new illustrated children’s book set in an indeterminate future in which the world is “hard and dry, and more and more difficult to live in” and in which, without warning, a large crack opens up in the ground. We find the Meadowsweet family, plus a chatty mynah bird called Octavia, marooned at the bottom of the crack and wondering how to get out. Octavia flies to the surface and returns with a seed which she drops into a tiny crack in the rock floor. A green shoot appears, followed by leaves, branches and edible green fruit. As the weed gets taller, the family starts climbing. Eventually, it bursts above the surface and the Meadowsweets are flung on to the ground “with greenery sprouting all around them. They sat and stared around with amazement.”We are sitting on a sofa in Blake’s office, the fabric of which is printed with his illustrations (you can also get Blake wallpaper, mugs, fridge magnets and tea towels). He is small, softly spoken with twinkly eyes and sticky-out hair: I’m not the first to observe that he looks a lot like one of his drawings. He is not sure how many books he has illustrated – “I haven’t counted them recently” – but reckons it’s more than 400. Despite being semi-retired, he is still incredibly prolific. He’s mostly given up doing public appearances and has scaled back the commissions. “Which means I can draw anything, you see,” he says, delightedly. “I draw every day. I draw in bed and when I’m sitting like this on the sofa.”His studio is in his flat around the corner, and he has another one in his other house in Hastings. “I spent 40 years working standing up at a plan chest with a light box on it, and eventually my doctor said: ‘No wonder your feet hurt. You’d better sit down.’ Sitting down still feels rather odd, though lying down is perfectly all right. Do you know Michael Morpurgo? He writes everything in bed.”He struggles to draw cars and buildings but birds have been a recurring motif, from the magpies in The Twits and the mynah bird in The Weed, to his illustrated version of Aristophanes’ The Birds. “I don’t know why,” says Blake. “Perhaps it’s partly because they’ve got two legs like us.” He asks his assistant, Nikki, to hand me a copy of his 2005 book, The Life of Birds, in which there are birds in spectacles walking in the park, birds as adolescents standing moodily with their hands deep in their pockets, and a bird sitting at a desk writing letters. A recent commission, he tells me, involved a series of drawings about whisky, and he was asked to bring in characters from Shakespeare’s Macbeth – “and they all ended up as birds. It’s what came naturally.”Although he turns down a lot of work, he still enjoys the challenge of drawing to order. Collaborations with authors have sustained much of his career. “Reading is the only thing I’ve got a qualification for,” he chuckles (he studied English at Cambridge). “I like drawing for myself but all those books, they’re so different in character … People often ask me where I get my ideas from and I say: ‘I get them from writers.’”Born in 1932 and raised in Sidcup, Kent, Blake doesn’t recall seeing many illustrated children’s books as a child. In his early teens he became aware of the 19th-century French caricaturist Honoré Daumier. “He was fascinating to me because he was an artist of major stature, but in newspapers.” He recalls going to a shop in Bromley with his mother and paying two guineas for a book on Daumier. “My mother said: ‘Are you sure you want to spend all that money on a book?’ I was and I did. I still have it.”Blake sent drawings to Punch magazine in his teens and, to his surprise, it paid him for them. He later found a mentor in the painter and illustrator Brian Robb, whom he tracked down at Chelsea School of Art with a view to studying with him. “He told me: ‘Don’t join my illustration class.’ I think he thought I’d done enough on my own. So instead I took in my drawings and he gave me a tutorial. He looked after me very well, and when he died he left me the contents of his studio. Extraordinary.”After university, Blake did a teaching diploma. The plan was to teach English, which he did part-time for a while, but he went on to teach illustration at the Royal College of Art. After university, he knew he wanted to draw full-time but, he says, “received wisdom was that you couldn’t make a living from it”. He had the last laugh when he finally gave up teaching to concentrate on drawing “my income increased dramatically”.Blake is currently working on drawings to accompany a series of poems by Michael Rosen called On the Move, about migration. “It’s a children’s book but anyone could read it. It’s about members of his family, many of whom were refugees.” He didn’t want to try to draw Rosen’s family, as that would have felt intrusive. “So what I’ve done is landscape pictures of people migrating. In one I’ve got a line of them going up a hill with their bags, and there’s another one with a bombed building in it. They’re not exactly illustrations, they’re things that might have happened to those people. But they’re generalised.”The hardest commission he ever had was Rosen’s Sad Book in 2004. It was about the author’s grief after the death of his 18-year-old son Eddie from meningitis. “I’d come across Eddie in earlier poems that Michael had written about him, so I’d drawn him as a small boy,” explains Blake. “I was very relieved that I’d never met him. It made it easier for me.” The first page had an illustration of Rosen with a smile on his face and big, wide eyes. “This is me being sad,” it says. “Maybe you think I’m being happy in this picture. Really I’m sad but pretending I’m being happy.” Usually, Blake will do two or three versions of an illustration and pick the best, but this was different. “I did it about 14 times,” he says.Blake rarely deals directly with authors when illustrating their books, although he would talk to Dahl from time to time – “We would have a discussion about what the BFG was going to wear, and that kind of thing.” Is it true that Dahl sent Blake a pair of sandals in the post and said he’d like the BFG to be wearing them? “Yes, that’s absolutely true,” he confirms, though he adds that most authors don’t do that. Once, when Rosen was asked about his working relationship with Blake, he replied, “I give it to him and he does it.” Blake tells me this approvingly. He doesn’t like to think too hard about where his ideas come from or what they mean. He just gets on with it.Nikki tells me it’s time for the last question so I ask Blake, who has never had a family of his own, if he ever seeks out the company of children to get a sense of what they like and don’t like. He looks slightly appalled at this. “Good God, no,” he exclaims. “Oh no. I get on with them perfectly well but spend time with them? No, no, no. There’s no need, you see. I just make it all up.”• The Weed by Quentin Blake is published by Tate (RRP £12.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

An economy largely based on the production of sugar brought wealth and led to the beginnings of an imperial system.But that system was built on the almost unimaginably brutal reality of slavery, enforced by almost equally unimaginable cruelties and daily punishments and control.The system was ruthless and relentless. In the mid-18th century one plantation in Westmoreland Parish, site of the most serious slave revolt in 1760, recorded twice as many deaths as births, many from pure overwork. Importation of fresh slaves, often from the Gold Coast of Africa, filled the gap and reinforced the system – yet contained the seeds of the system’s eventual destruction.Vincent Brown’s Tacky’s Revolt: The Story of An Atlantic Slave War, places the Jamaican revolts of 1760 firmly within the broader history of the time, notably the Seven Years War, for which Brown comments that “historians have barely noticed that the Jamaican insurrection was one of its major battles”. The judgment is correct when one remembers that the Caribbean, not just Quebec, was key to British strategy.War suffuses this book: wars among African polities, wars between the European powers such as the War of Jenkins’ Ear and the Seven Years War, war and violence on the daily life of the plantation between master and enslaved. These “wars within wars”, Brown writes, ensured that “slavery’s violent conflicts integrated Europe, Africa, America, and the Atlantic ocean”.Brown endorses the phrase of freed slave and soldier Olaudah Equiano: that slavery was itself a “state of war”. Overseer and diarist Thomas Thistlewood chronicled the inhumanity of slavery, including his own brutalities. The daily violence of plantation life was a war for control no less than the broader contest in the Caribbean between Britain, France and Spain.It is thus a small step for Brown to conclude that “recognizing slave revolt as a species of warfare is the first step toward a new cartography of Atlantic slavery”.African commanders including Tacky, who had probably held “a royal office or lineage in one of the Gold Coast’s eastern kingdoms”, and Apongo, a leader among the Akan-speaking peoples in both Africa and Jamaica, brought knowledge of military strategy and tactics.Brown studies the movements of the insurrection closely and draws conclusions about its military and political aims. With experience of African political and economic life, the slaves sought something more than freedom alone. As Brown writes, their “pattern of warfare indicates an attempt at territorial and political control, a strategy of maneuver rather than of retreat, evasion, or escape”.The revolt of the title was put down suddenly and fiercely. It began on 7 April 1760 in St Mary’s Parish but was possibly premature. A larger conflict, which the British called the Coromantee war, was timed for the Whitsun holidays and for when the merchant fleet sailed to Britain, leaving the island less defended. It continued for months.After initial success in Westmoreland Parish and retreat into the mountains and forests from which they conducted skirmishes and other tactics largely derived from African warfare, the Coromantee rebels succumbed to overwhelming British power.“The Navy brought the full resources of transatlantic empire to bear against the rebels,” Brown writes, “articulating the local conflict to the wider war.”Dense, closely argued and meticulously researched, this is not popular history, perhaps in either sense of the word. But it is important history. Historians have long recognized the Seven Years War as a global conflict but this book brings the role of Africa – and Africans – fully into the struggle.As Brown writes in conclusion: “The Coromantee war was at once an extension of the African conflicts that fed the slave trade, a race war among black slaves and white slaveholders, an imperial conquest, and an internal struggle between black people for control of territory and the establishment of a political legacy.“The economic, political and cultural consequences of this war within wars reverberated out from Jamaica to other colonies, across the ocean to Great Britain and back again to the island, where the revolt reshaped public life and lodged deeply in collective memory.”The Jamaican revolts influenced, sometimes in subtle ways, the movement for abolition of the slave trade, and eventually slavery itself, on both sides of the Atlantic. To correct a victor’s perspective and recover lost history and the dignity of the enslaved, Brown has written a 21st-century military history – one which takes full account of all the combatants and those for whom they fought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddb545fd0ec4994bbb4cf21148e98b8d25d0997d/0_333_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fa0c11097474b69c242fa7f3bc7408e","title":"john lewis launches hand me down clothing drive","story":"Retailer seeks to cut fashion waste with children’s coats featuring reusable name tagsJohn Lewis is tackling fashion waste by launching a hand-me-down drive with extended name labels attached to children’s coats that can be easily amended by parents.The department store chain is introducing organic cotton labelling inside its own-brand children’s coats so the new owner can cross out the name of the last person and write a new name. Coats have been chosen to test this labelling because they have a long life and are often the most costly garment for parents.A new slogan – “Wear it, love it, hand it down” – is also appearing on all cardboard labels attached to the retailer’s entire ranges of own-brand babywear and childrenswear.Baby and childrenswear represent a disproportionate amount of the thousands of tonnes of clothing in landfill because children quickly outgrow their clothing, typically moving up seven sizes in their first two years. As well as the high cost and limited life, mass production of garments places huge pressure on the environment through waste, water consumption and carbon emissions. Britons bin about 300,000 tonnes of clothing a year.Caroline Bettis, the head childrenswear buyer at John Lewis, said: “We’re proud of the quality of our clothes and want them to have a really long life and be handed down again and again. “We hope these new labels will help to grow the culture of handing down clothes which can be worn again by other children.”The retailer will also from next week further extend its fashion “buyback” trial covering any worn and unwanted clothing from its customers – including underwear and old socks – to five more stores and a Waitrose branch.In an industry first trialled at its London Oxford Street and Oxford shops, customers can arrange through an app to have any unwanted clothing that they bought from John Lewis collected from their home, and will be paid for each item regardless of its condition.Among other high-street clothing recycling initiatives, the fashion retailer Monsoon has also introduced a “Love. Wear. Recycle” label.In another solution to the high turnover of barely worn babygrows and vests, families are saving time and money by renting or hiring clothing “bundles”. Subscribers pay a monthly subscription to companies such as Bundlee and Belles and Babes which offer ethical-branded, age-appropriate clothes and receive new outfits in the post. The clothes, washed, ironed and ready to be worn again, are sent back when the child has outgrown them, with another bundle arriving soon after."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9997ea560fc87a592c73a1c3a05925d132f4023b/1041_1089_8846_5309/master/8846.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02d657db834714109f17cd5ffb4e9fe3","title":"art and commerce a history of the art of advertising in pictures","story":"A new book examines the artistic development of advertising and the innovative ways that ads combined images, text and product to communicate and attract potential customers.

The premium also differed depending on the subject studied.The report comes as the government in England is applying additional scrutiny to universities and outcomes for graduates, with some ministers looking to restrict the numbers taking so-called “low-value” courses.Overall, the IFS found the government benefited from extra tax revenue and national insurance contributions of £110,000 per man and £30,000 per woman, over and above the costs of study to the government.“The exchequer gains a lot on average from higher education, despite the high costs of writing off unpaid student loans. That is mainly because high-earning graduates go on to pay an awful lot of tax,” said Ben Waltmann, an IFS economist and co-author of the report.“But this analysis also shows that the government makes an overall loss on financing the degrees of nearly half of all graduates. These losses are concentrated amongst those studying certain subjects.“For creative arts, for example, the losses are substantial. This need not mean that the government is misallocating funds but it is important to be aware of the costs involved.”Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, said that while the benefits of higher education included “unquantifiable experiences and friendships,” she was still concerned about value for money.“It is no surprise our universities attract students from all over the world. However, that prestige is built on quality and my role is to work with the regulator to safeguard that, while ensuring students and the taxpayer are getting the value they would expect for their investment,” Donelan said.The Department for Education said the earnings data would define the benefits of higher education and “help students of all ages make smart choices about their future”.However, Jo Grady, the general secretary of the University and College Union, said: “It is vital to recognise that education is about much more than just financial benefit. Focussing on future income following university ignores the wider benefits that education brings to iniduals and to society.”But while men’s earnings rocketed up from the age of 30, women’s earnings growth was far lower, with childbearing and family formation the most likely factor. The IFS said women “see little difference in average returns” across different universities, while male graduates who attended Oxbridge and Russell Group universities earned more than their peers at other institutions.Jack Britton, another co-author of the report, said: “This work highlights how important the 30s are for graduate men. Rapid earnings growth of male graduates in this period has a large positive impact on their average return to higher education such that three quarters of men end up better off as a result of having done a degree.”The new research is based on annual incomes and fails to take account of hours worked, with non-graduates working longer hours for the same income, according to previous research."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84cd649e594f28952de632d487735a796de1df4/1065_701_746_448/master/746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf22f29d8bed5194fe813d2cdc15539","title":"greta thunberg bristol schools shut students join climate strike","story":"Teenage activist tells huge crowd: ‘We will not be silenced because we are the change’Tens of thousands of people, many of them children skipping school, braved heavy rain to join a climate strike headed by Greta Thunberg in Bristol city centre.The vast crowd fell silent as the 17-year-old activist told them governments were acting like children and so it fell to young people to be “the adults in the room”.Police said there were more than 15,000 people at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate event, while Thunberg estimated the figure as at least 30,000.As Thunberg spoke, onlookers clambered on to bus shelters and up trees and hung out of windows to catch a glimpse.Criticising governments and the media, she said: “Once again they sweep their mess under the rug for us – young people, their children – to clean up for them. We must continue and we have to be patient. Remember that the changes required will not happen overnight.”Thunberg arrived in Bristol by train and was driven to the climate strike in a red Nissan Leaf electric car.Wearing a yellow raincoat and woolly hat – a look copied by some of her devotees – she took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta” from schoolchildren and teenagers.She told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power.“Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.”Thunberg flagged up the recent decision by north Somerset council to oppose Bristol airport expansion as an example of what could be achieved if activists worked together.The Swedish teenager went on to join protesters on a march through the city centre accompanied by a samba band. She waved at well-wishers and at one point consoled a child who was clearly overwhelmed by the experience.Avon and Somerset police had warned of the potential for protesters to be hurt and urged parents not to allow children to go unaccompanied.Bristol Cathedral, which sits on College Green, was ready to open its doors to anyone needing refuge but the organisers insisted they had put enough measures in place to make sure nobody was hurt.Emily said: “I think it’s really important that people understand what is happening to the Earth.” She was returning to school after the event to give a presentation on climate change.Isaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them along. Maya said: “We want to help make a change. Greta’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message. It was cold and wet but it is was worth it. It was exciting to see how many people care.”Davies said: “I was against them taking time off school but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational. It was a lovely experience … It’s good to see that so many people can be inspired by one girl.”Hannah Burge, 12, and Harvey Hennessy, 16, have organised school strikes in Barnstaple, north Devon. Their biggest turnout has been 850. “It’s been amazing seeing so many people here,” said Hannah. “Greta is such a role model for us.”Mya-Rose Craig, 17, an ornithologist who recently became the youngest person in the UK to be awarded an honorary doctorate, said: “It’s so cool to see so many thousands of young people here ready to fight for our future.”Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 and the school’s “green team” to the event. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”The crowd was swollen by many students who were missing lectures, tutorials and lab sessions. But it was not just young people who attended. There were groups of doctors, nurses and even a collective of wildlife film-makers.One moment of tension came when police equipped with video cameras moved through the crowd pointing their lenses at strikers, including a group from the Public and Commercial Services Union.Some employers had turned a blind eye to workers taking time to attend. Good Energy, a green energy company from Chippenham in Wiltshire, went further by actively telling its 250-strong workforce to join the strike. The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, tweeted:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801574d804e937a790ae5a1f322bea82c96afbb6/540_142_1474_884/master/1474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a2a9d204b593e0712ba2db28495e54","title":"50 ways to green up your life save the planet","story":"Expert tips on how to be kinder to the planet – from cooking and cleaning to fashion and financeLove your leftoversLook at what basics you’re binning. “Chefs talk about what to do with carrot tops or whey from cheese, but that’s not where we need to make changes,” says Feast food writer Anna Jones. “It’s the milk poured down the sink and stale bread – the items we don’t put as much value on.” Jones tears up bread to freeze for instant croutons, or whizzes it into breadcrumbs for adding to croustades, pastas and salads. If oats have already been made into porridge, follow Claire Thomson, chef and author of The Art Of The Larder (Quadrille, £25), and substitute for some of the flour and water in bread dough.Treat “food waste” as ingredients, says Ollie Hunter, chef and author of 30 Easy Ways To Join The Food Revolution (Pavilion, £14.99). “It’s easy to turn it into something else aquafaba (chickpea water) can be made into a vegan mayonnaise fry squash seeds in oil and sprinkle with salt for a snack cut courgette stalks into penne shapes and cook like pasta. You need to find creative ways to use everything up wasting food is down to a lack of imagination.”Use tech for goodApps are taking the fight to food waste. Olio connects neighbours and local retailers so surplus food can be shared Too Good To Go enables cafes and restaurants to sell uneaten meals at reduced rates while Farmdrop connects you with sustainable local farmers. To recycle kitchen scraps, find neighbours with a compost bin (or chickens) at sharewaste.Shop little and oftenA lot of waste comes from doing big shops, putting two-for-one “bargains” in the trolley and buying on repeat rather than planning meals. “I’m always clear about what we will eat at home and when,” says Skye Gyngell, chef and founder of Spring in London, which runs a “scratch menu” using waste. She shops little and often, supported by a store cupboard of wholegrains, olive oil, vinegars and mustards to bolster meals. “Working out what kind of cook you are is also useful,” says Jones, “then reverse engineer how you shop. There is no point doing a weekly shop if you like to decide what you’re going to make for dinner at 6pm, like me. I shop in small increments, and I find I waste less this way, too.”Pick your own“Foraging solves many problems,” Hunter says. “You’re getting into the countryside, engaging with nature and the community, and finding food that has a different flavour.” Start with herbs, grasses, berries, wild garlic and, a favourite of Hunter’s, nettles (“They’re so underrated”). Use to garnish pies, in risottos and soups wear gloves to avoid stings and wash thoroughly in salted water. Ensure foraged ingredients are identifiable before eating – check woodlandtrust.org or wildfooduk.Switch your floursCrops can’t be grown every year in the same soil without replacing nutrients taken by the plants, and switching the flour you use can help. “Spelt or wheat is often grown in rotation with rye and clover to replace lost nitrogen,” says Hunter. “Eating rye supports the farmers’ rotation I use spelt and emmer flour as an alternative to wheat because they have similar baking properties, while being beneficial to the soil.”Befriend a butcher“There is no way around it, eating meat sustainably requires a little more effort on our part,” says Fergus Henderson, chef and godfather of nose-to-tail eating. His first rule is to “hug” your butcher: “Support them and ask questions – they are your way in to a positive supply chain. They will also give you access to the insides and extremities, such as kidneys, shanks, feet and glands, which offer so much more possibility and flavour than the fillet.” Whole-animal eating is not about blood and guts, but “respecting the animal enough to realise that, if it has died for you, the least you can do is make use of every part”. Compost on the goCompost isn’t just for the garden – think about reducing your food waste when you’re on the go, too, says Lindsay Miles, whose book Less Waste, No Fuss Kitchen: Simple Steps To Shop, Cook And Eat Sustainably (Hardie Grant, £12.99) is out in June. “A reusable coffee cup makes a great impromptu container for your lunch scraps – take apple cores or bread crusts home to compost.”Plan aheadMake the most of seasonal gluts and preserve vegetables in oils, vinegars, chutneys, ketchup and marinades, or freeze them. “Blitz and freeze tomatoes in containers for passata all year round make kimchi from cauliflower stalks and leaves use beetroot in jams, vinegars and oil, then chop stalks and leaves to top pastas, pizzas, curries and dal,” says Hunter.Minimise packagingLook for loose fruit and vegetables, and take your own containers to shops and markets. “If you are buying packaged food,” says Miles, “look at where the product comes from and try to choose the more local option – oat milk from Scotland will have a lower carbon footprint than almond milk from California, even if they have the same packaging.” The most recyclable plastics are PET, found in drinks bottles and fruit punnets, and HDPE, in milk bottles and cereal box liners so if you can’t avoid it, go for these, then reuse or recycle what you can.Clean with castileBy making cleaning products (from polish to detergent) you can reduce the amount of plastic entering your home and the level of harmful VOCs (volatile organic compounds), such as formaldehyde, that are released. “Of all the green cleaning ingredients I use, liquid castile soap is by far my favourite,” writes Jen Chillingsworth in Clean Green (Quadrille, £7.55). “Originating from Spain, castile soap was traditionally made with pure olive oil, but is now more commonly produced by mixing vegetable oils such as hemp, avocado, jojoba and coconut.” For a simple, multipurpose kitchen spray, add 50ml of castile soap to 800ml tap water in a spray bottle. Add a few drops of essential oils (tea tree is antibacterial). Spray and wipe with a clean cloth.Go for plastic-free personal careThere is a world of waste-free sanitary protection to explore, and Chillingsworth suggests buying a reusable tampon applicator. “The reusable version fits every size of tampon, is antimicrobial and easy to insert. After use, give it a wipe, rinse and return to the storage box that fits in your handbag. Sterilise in hot water between periods.”Recycle as much as you can“Most major supermarkets provide plastic recycling collection points in store for stretchy plastic (such as frozen food bags, carrier bags and bread bags) which normally can’t be recycled from home,” says Helen Bird, plastics expert at government waste advisory body Wrap.TerraCycle rescues hard-to-recycle waste that is not processed by councils. It has free national recycling programmes and also sells zero-waste boxes, which you can fill with most non-hazardous, non-recyclable and non-organic waste, and return for recycling. Search its website for a scheme near you, or set one up. Look after your electrical appliancesThe Restart Project is a social enterprise that aims to fix our relationship with electricals and electronics. Cofounder Janet Gunter says the first step in keeping household appliances for longer is regular cleaning. “By simply cleaning and maintaining your white goods, laptop or mobile, you will prolong its life.” Restart runs a nationwide network of skill-sharing workshops as well as promoting a directory of commercial repair options in London. (See also repaircafe.org for events in your area.) “If we don’t have access to spare parts,” says Gunter, “these appliances will be thrown away, which has a huge carbon impact.” If your electrical appliance really is beyond repair, Rhoads suggests you “call the manufacturer or company of purchase to see if they will take back items or packaging for reuse or recycling”. Not all charity shops accept electrical items, but the homelessness charity Emmaus accepts working items. These are tested before being resold, which makes it a good place to purchase secondhand electrical goods, too.Create clean air“You can never have enough house plants,” says Oliver Heath, who runs a sustainable architecture practice. Certain plants are best for certain rooms: “Mother-in-law’s tongue gives off oxygen at night, which makes it best suited to the bedroom.” According to Chillingsworth, peace lilies and boston ferns thrive in rooms with high humidity and can reduce the mould spores in the air, making them ideal for bathrooms weeping figs have been found to be the best plant for removing formaldehyde released from carpets and furniture, making them good for living areas.Change your shower head“Investing in an aerated shower head will make a significant difference to energy and water consumption,” says Brian Horne at the Energy Saving Trust (EST). They inject air into the water stream, limiting water usage. “A water-efficient shower head could save a four-person household £70 a year on gas for water heating, and a further £115 on water bills if they have a meter,” says Horne. Opt for green energy suppliersThere are “shades of green” when it comes to choosing an energy supplier, says Horne. The EST identified four suppliers who clearly listed the renewable sources of their energy on their websites last year: Green Energy UK, Good Energy, Ecotricity and Octopus Energy. “But just because you’re on a green tariff, it doesn’t mean you should stop worrying about how much energy you use,” says Horne.Draught-proof your homeOne of the cheapest, most effective ways to save energy and money at home is to draught-proof windows, doors, letterbox, fireplaces and loft hatches, says Dr Sarah Price, head of building physics at Enhabit, a consultancy specialising in low-energy design. Done professionally, it costs about £200, or do it yourself with products such as Gap Seal.Buy vintage furniture“Reusing furniture is the best thing to do, and so much more fun than buying new,” says Nicola Harding, founder of interior design studio Harding and Read. “Secondhand items come with interesting stories and force you to think creatively, and give you have something far more unique.” To keep mileage down, start at your local auction houses and charity shops (the British Heart Foundation has dedicated home stores and a free collection service), followed by a targeted trawl through Freecycle and Facebook Marketplace. Alternatively, grow your own flowers to bring indoors. Gardener Sarah Raven suggests going for “annuals which are cut and come again: pick above a pair of leaves and the plant will spring back and produce more flowers – and keep on doing so as long as you keep picking”. Sow cosmos, snapdragons, zinnias and rudbeckias on a sunny window ledge in March, pot on and plant out after the last frosts.Encourage beesHoneybees visit only one type of flower in any one foraging trip, says Sarah Wyndham Lewis, author of Planting For Honeybees: The Grower’s Guide To Creating A Buzz. “This is called ‘flower fidelity’ and is what makes them such effective pollinators. So plant large clumps or ‘drifts’ of single species and optimise each of the bees’ trips.” Think swathes of catmint, field scabious and hyssop. “March to September are the key months for honeybees – they will fly whenever the temperature is above 10C, even in winter, so early- and late-flowering plants are especially valuable,” she says. Spend less, propagate moreYour own plot is the best garden centre there is: collect seed, learn to take cuttings and ide plants to stock your own backup nursery. Gaps can then be filled with home‑propagated stock plants. Increase what does well in your garden to build a healthy community of plants. If you do go shopping, research a plant’s natural habitat to reduce failures. Lock up carbonIn The Garden Jungle, Or Gardening To Save The Planet (out in paperback 2 April, Vintage, £9.99), Dave Goulson explains that although many gardeners don’t have room for large trees, “The basic rule is that the more vegetation you have, the more carbon you are storing.” So the fuller the planting in your garden, the better, even if it verges on overgrown. Don’t be too tidy, either. “Log piles also lock up carbon for as long as it takes them to decay, which can be many years.” Let the grass growLetting your grass grow longer between cuts not only saves petrol or electricity, and therefore reduces carbon dioxide emissions, but also encourages more wildlife into your garden. Longer grass is more drought-resistant, too. Try cutting every three or four weeks and let dandelions, daisies and violets bloom in spring, followed by buttercups, clovers and selfheal in summer.Encourage hedgehogsHedgehogs have a voracious appetite for pests such as caterpillars, slugs and snails. They need easy access in and out of gardens, say Helen Bostock and Sophie Collins, authors of How Can I Help Hedgehogs? (Octopus, £14.99). They recommend that neighbours get together to arrange hedgehog holes between gardens. “This is simply a hole cut into the bottom of a fence – it should be around 13cm high and at least as wide, preferably in a sheltered corner.”Set a barIf a year without buying anything new seems too big a challenge, try a month, or buy only secondhand. Livia Firth, founder of sustainability consultancy Eco-Age, follows the “30 wears rule”: ask, “Will I wear it at least 30 times?” before buying.Find a secondhand that works for youOpting for vintage or secondhand is one of the easiest ways to shop sustainably, but while some fans will extol the virtues of rifling through giant warehouses, this approach is not for everyone. Thankfully, there are other ways. Smaller stores with a curated selection may not offer quite the same bargains as a car boot sale, but they can be less intimidating. Many, such as Paper Dress Vintage or Cow, also have websites.Shop in person – and aloneThat said, shopping in person – especially if you walk there – is usually greener than online. Clothes shipped across the world have a significant carbon footprint, and often come packaged in plastic. You are also less likely to return things you have tried on.It can help to ditch your friends. “When you ask a friend if you should buy something, you already know the answer will be yes,” writes Lauren Bravo in How To Break Up With Fast Fashion (Headline, £12.99). “It’s an unwritten rule of sisterhood.” Think of it as the new version of not going supermarket shopping when you’re hungry.Choose materials wiselySome fabrics age better than others the ’s styling editor, Melanie Wilkinson, recommends looking for leather when shopping secondhand. Leather jackets, shoes and belts last for years and often look and feel better once they have been worn in. The environmental impact of denim – another durable fabric – means jeans are also best bought secondhand.Unsubscribe and unfollow“If someone wants to quit fast fashion, I recommend unsubscribing from all the emails,” says writer and fashion consultant Aja Barber. “A brand that is constantly introducing new products might be sustainable in name only. Sending emails and pressuring consumers to buy, buy, buy is not sustainability – that’s fast fashion.” The same goes for influencers and brands on social platforms such as Instagram. Deleting fast-fashion shopping apps can help, too.Get swishingClothes swaps – known as swishing – are one of the greenest ways to refresh your wardrobe. They offer credits based on the value of the items you bring, which can be swapped for items brought by others. Avoid trends and hunt for quality pieces you’ll wear for years. Find one near you at swishing.Make your clothes fitLayla Sargent, founder of The Seam, a website to connect you with local tailors, seamstresses and embroidery artists, says: “If it doesn’t fit well, you’re never going to wear it. Even by making trousers just the right length, or altering a waistband slightly, we will be inclined to wear them more.” The service is currently only in the London area, but coming to Manchester and Birmingham this year. Meanwhile, start with your local dry cleaner.Make your own apron from a pair of old jeansTurn a pair of old jeans into a denim work apron by unpicking the inside leg seams and stitching them together. This is one of many hacks from The Great British Sewing Bee’s book on Sustainable Style (Quadrille, £27, published on 26 March).Darn your socks“Once a life skill, darning has skipped a generation (or two),” says Emma Mathews of Socko (socko.shop), which makes socks from repurposed yarn. “But we can learn a lot from the way things were done in the past.” Sew small running stitches up and down the area around the hole and then turn the repair around and stitch perpendicular to them, weaving the thread together until you have covered the hole. Highly therapeutic.Primp your trainersThis is a growing service industry. Gråel in Liverpool is a small business that specialises in cleaning “coveted footwear”, offering laces cleaning (£3), a deep clean (£15) and the meticulous premium package from undersole to insole (£35). Meanwhile, Jason Markk offers premium shoe care from branches in LA and Carnaby Street in London, where your trainers will be brought back to life by the brand’s sneaker-care technicians.Lose the disposablesA staggering 20,000 litres of water are needed to create only 1kg of cotton – that’s enough to make just one T-shirt and a pair of jeans, so any cotton you buy should count. Replacing cotton wool is a good start. Remove the initial bulk of makeup with a reusable disc, such as Face Halo (£7), soaked in plain water. These do an astoundingly good job, even on waterproof mascara. Follow with a cleanser and a wet terry-cotton flannel both flannel and disc should last for hundreds of washing machine cycles. For toners, exfoliants and nail polish remover, use washable bamboo pads. A pack of 18, plus washbag, costs about £10.Don’t be tempted by minisThose pick’n’mix bars of travel-sized beauty products are so alluring, but cause a huge amount of waste for no reason and very little product. Instead, make a one-off investment in refillable travel bottles and pots from Muji (from 95p) or any high street chemist, and decant your favourite full sizes – or, even better, wash out and reuse any mini bottles you already have. Remember that active skincare such as vitamin C or retinol serums are best left in their original packaging to safeguard their stability, but anything else can be decanted for travel. And if you have so many minis left over from flights and hotel stays that you won’t use them all, take them to your nearest homeless shelter, where their clients need them.Embrace bathsBaths have long been seen as more wasteful and less responsible than showering, but some research shows that modern, pumped power showers can use more, not less, water than bathing. It is possible to enjoy a luxurious, but environmentally considerate, bath. Use sulphate-free oils, salts or foams and relax (I’ve even been known to wash posh, delicate bras while I soak). You can save more water by washing hair over the bath before climbing in, allowing the water to fill the tub – the shampoo will create bubbles, too.Save water and lower your billsConsider switching to a water meter, so you pay for only the water you use. Invest the money you save into water-saving devices and plumbing, such as rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling systems. Get free water-saving products from savewatersavemoney. If you live in England and Wales, you can get a water meter fitted for free, but you may need to pay £300 if you live in Scotland. A number of investment funds have clean water and sanitation as their dominant theme, says Becky O’Connor of Royal London. For example, Parvest Aqua and RobecoSam Sustainable Water are recommended by ethical financial website good-with-money.Get a loan to improve your home’s energy efficiencySome lenders provide cheap green mortgages and loans for energy-efficient improvements. Ecology Building Society offers discounts to customers borrowing for this. Nationwide says it will start offering low-interest loans of up to £25,000 to homeowners who want to retrofit existing properties with energy-efficiency measures.Choose an environmentally friendly current accountNearly £150bn has been invested in fossil fuels by UK banks since the Paris climate agreement was adopted in 2016. Ethical bank Triodos, which has the backing of Friends of the Earth, invests only in projects that create positive cultural, social and environmental outcomes. To review your bank’s track record, see lobbying organisation BankTrack, which reports on the activities that banks finance worldwide.Invest wisely“Look at funds with sustainability in mind,” says Alice Evans, co-head of the BMO Global Investment’s responsible investment team. “Invest in funds that are described as ‘responsible’, ‘SRI’ (socially responsible investment), ‘ethical’ or ‘dark green’. These have the strictest criteria and avoid investing in any company that may have a poor record on environmental, human rights or other ethical grounds.” Evaluate your pension“For many people, their workplace pension will be their largest investment,” says Rich Mayor of research and analysis company Fundscape. You have the right to know where your money is being invested. “Ask your HR department or pension provider what funds you’re invested in and whether there is a sustainable or ethical option,” says Jon Dean, head of retirement strategy for financial services consultancy Altus.Get a green financial adviserLast year, a new financial advice firm called The Path was set up to invest only in portfolios that have a positive impact on the planet. “You don’t need to be a millionaire to invest your money wisely,” says founder David MacDonald. “With very little effort you can make a significant difference, moving from harming the planet with your money to sustaining it.” Some research suggests that making sure your investments are sustainable has 27 times more impact than all the other things you could do to reduce your carbon footprint added together. “If you put the maximum annual ISA contribution of £20,000 into a positive-impact fund, it would be the carbon equivalent of taking one car off the road,” MacDonald says.• If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a71ecd9ef691f4903361587e825b5c91f633ef5/0_0_5515_3682/master/5515.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11b155690fa046a58bb5b9f60bb77b02 700w","title":"tell us have you not bought clothes for more than 10 years","story":"We’re interested in hearing from people who haven’t bought any clothes for the last 10 years Konnie Huq has revealed that she hasn’t bought any clothes in 10 years.

His mouth froths. He gets so excited that he spills some of his lemon and ginger tea on the floor of the photo studio we’re sitting in. “Oh dear,” he says, Iggy Pop transforming rapidly into an extremely apologetic, polite young man. “I’m just going to wipe that up with my bum.” And so he does – sliding across the floor while his black trousers soak up the drink.A polite young man George MacKay might be, but at just 27 he’s had plenty of practice trying on other personas: a closeted gay activist in Pride, a singing Scottish squaddie in Sunshine On Leith and – most recently – Lance Corporal Will Schofield in Sam Mendes’ first world war smash, 1917. He is soon to play the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in True History Of The Kelly Gang, which is where today’s unlikely punk outburst comes in: director Justin Kurzel wanted his young actors to put a punky spin on the tale of the Aussie folk hero, so he booked a gig venue and told them to perform their own songs live as a punk band. MacKay is treating me to one of his self-penned numbers.“We put on dresses and rubbed ash in our eyes,” he recalls of the performance by the resulting band, Fleshlight. MacKay came up with the name: “It’s a… it’s a sort of… sex toy that you can, um, unscrew and, er, make love to,” he says, his bashfulness further proof that Iggy has left the building.MacKay adores this immersive way of working – not just researching but living his roles. To prepare for True History Of The Kelly Gang, he lived in the bush, bulking up by chopping wood and riding horses. Sadly, not every aspect of physical transformation was as easy to achieve: the outlaw Kelly was renowned for his manly whiskers, yet baby-faced MacKay struggled to grow any facial hair. “I honestly thought I was going to lose the part,” he says.What did his attempt at a beard look like?They tried a stick-on beard but Kurzel wasn’t convinced. Then the director had a brainwave – what could be more punk rock than playing Australia’s hairiest antihero with baby-smooth cheeks? “Just grow a mullet instead,” came the instructions, which MacKay managed.Fortunately, no facial fuzz was needed for 1917, in which MacKay’s role – alongside another relatively little-known actor (Dean-Charles Chapman) – was to be a young man in an old man’s war. The story follows the two soldiers on their mission to carry a vital message deep behind enemy lines. Again, MacKay threw himself into the part: army boot camps, six months of rehearsals, understanding the function of every bit of archaic military kit. The Oscar-winning film was famously shot in “one take” (in reality, very long takes – some of them almost 10 minutes – stitched together) and the last thing anyone needed was to get seven minutes into a take, only for the safety catch on a rifle to jam.Sometimes, though, mistakes were encouraged. In one epic scene, MacKay hurtles down the frontline while allied troops emerge over the trenches he gets floored by one soldier, something that wasn’t scripted. “When everyone’s blood’s up and the bombs are going off, that happens,” MacKay says. “Sam wanted it to be natural and alive, so he kept it.”As an actor, MacKay is already something of a war veteran: he’s fought the first world war three times, and the second world war twice. For him, this has meant delving into an awful lot of history books, including harrowing first-person accounts. “We talk about seeing the inside of a person in a spiritual or figurative sense,” he says. “But these people would really see it. To see someone’s organs, or their bone split and poke out. Picking up a friend’s leg and it coming away…” He shudders.At the same time, he is keen to stress that being an actor is nothing like being a soldier. “I hope this isn’t a terribly misjudged thing to say,” he caveats at one point, and, “This is only my extremely cushy version of it.” But he does note some parallels: there is the sense of brotherhood on a film set the returning home after an experience that nobody else has been through the sense of pushing yourself beyond normal limits. MacKay’s 1917 character, Schofield, is a quiet soul who bottles up his emotions as a way of forgetting his life back home, and MacKay thinks he did something similar while working on True History Of The Kelly Gang.MacKay grew up in Barnes, a villagey suburb of south-west London on the bank of the Thames. His parents (his mother is a costume designer, his father a lighting and stage director) sent him to the independent Harrodian school, which encouraged his love of drama. By the time he was 10, MacKay had his first acting job, and was whisked away to Australia for eight months to play Curly, one of the lost boys in PJ Hogan’s 2003 version of Peter Pan. Back in London, he got on with the business of becoming a normal teenager: “I didn’t really talk about it much,” he shrugs.His career hasn’t been all plain sailing. He failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, but refused to be disheartened: “I decided the next job I got, I was going to actively learn and listen, and look for jobs that could facilitate the learning I would have done there.” And so he picked roles that pushed him to new places. The part he wanted more than anything was that of Edmond in the 2013 postapocalyptic teen drama How I Live Now – because he wanted to learn from its director Kevin Macdonald and then rising star Saoirse Ronan. “I was 20, had spent a year not working, and I knew she was this amazing actress,” he says. “Even back then, she was a trailblazer.”The two ended up dating while on set (“I suspected what was going on but they kept it very quiet,” Macdonald would later say), which must have made finding the onscreen chemistry a bit easier.“Yeah,” he says. “I just admire that woman so much. She’s an amazing human being, but that’s all I can say.”Does he make a habit of falling for his co-stars? “It seems obvious that, if that’s who you’re spending time with, and who you’re getting to know, that’s how we meet everyone,” he deflects. “It’s not a constant through-line but we all meet people some way, either at work or in a pub.”Is he single at the moment? “I can’t say.”He is less cautious when it comes to picking his parts. MacKay’s cross-dressing Ned Kelly, for instance, is charged with sexual energy: there’s a homoerotic frisson between him and Nicholas Hoult, who plays a young constable interested in Kelly’s sister and his relationship with his onscreen mother (played by the director’s wife, Essie Davis) would make Freud blush. As MacKay puts it, “It’s a beautiful, weird oedipal relationship where he’s the little boy to his mum but he’s also her man, and she’s his greatest woman and greatest love.”Playing characters such as Lutz and Kelly has made him “think a little bit harder” about social constructs, he says, specifically ones that have benefited him. “I am recognising that I have never, as a white male, felt like I couldn’t walk into a room,” he says. “It’s a wonderful thing to feel confident. So it’s been a brilliant realisation to be, like, wow, that’s not a feeling that everyone feels? Not everyone feels they could get cast for this? Why, subconsciously, do I feel that confidence – and other people subconsciously feel inferior?”In an interview last year, MacKay said that he wanted to be more political in his life and work, but his innate caution and fear of offending means he probably won’t usurp Joaquin Phoenix in the wild outburst charts any time soon. When I ask which way he votes, he flushes, looks panicked and, after a pause that seems to hang in the air, puts his hand to his chest and says he would prefer to keep that private. He wants to say the right things about ersity in Hollywood, and equal pay, too, but when we try there are so many false starts – an avalanche of ums and ahs – that watching him try to answer each question feels almost cruel.“Sorry, I’m not really articulating myself,” he says. “I’m just trying to be careful. I should know the answers to these things, for myself more than anyone.”A few weeks after we meet, 1917 wins big at the Baftas, scooping seven awards including best film, best director and best cinematographer for veteran film-maker Roger Deakins. MacKay presents an award with Dean-Charles Chapman, who has been by his side almost constantly over several intense months of publicity-blitzing around the globe. The actors look nervously out at the crowd before MacKay asks if this is still part of Deakins’ continuous take. Unlike most presenters, they get a genuine laugh.A week later, MacKay is presenting again – this time at the Oscars – and then he is back on a plane to the UK, where he calls me. If he’s exhausted, it doesn’t show. “It was huge,” he enthuses of the Academy Awards. “I grew up watching the results, so to be part of it was overwhelming. Just being in physical proximity, just 10 yards away from Brad Pitt, or Beyoncé, or Scarlett Johansson – and look, there’s Tom Hanks!”But the memory that will stick in his mind is of reuniting with the cast and crew of 1917 at the Bafta after-party: “When we were making the film, everyone was in their gear all the time – either war costumes or boots and rain macs. So to walk into that room and see a huge number of the crew all done up and smiling was the best thing.”It sounds as if he’s got a taste for this kind of thing. He laughs and shrugs off the notion, saying that it was a privilege just to be part of a successful film. But I suspect this is MacKay being the polite young man again. And I suspect there will be plenty more plaudits coming his way – probably before he’s managed to grow a proper beard.● True History Of The Kelly Gang is out nowIf you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/defac15e9f52ed94778e54747975ca06e97da155/0_31_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e91618c62bc8484c9cc7dbb33beb1eb7","title":"the wild goose lake diao yinan mubi cannes 2019 chinese film noir","story":"Having missed out in a vintage year at Cannes, Diao Yinan’s dazzling The Wild Goose Lake is now available to stream – joining some of this fine director’s earlier work The further it recedes in the rearview mirror, the more last year’s Cannes competition looks like an exceptionally good vintage. This week, British cinema audiences can finally see the rapturous beauty of Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire for themselves, while Parasite, now with a history-making Oscar win to match its Palme d’Or, keeps racking up the numbers. That’s in addition to such standouts released last year as Atlantics, Pain and Glory and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, with plenty yet to come: only half of last year’s competition has yet been released at all.Mubi, of course, is helping out with some lower-profile treasures. They have ferocious Brazilian provocation Bacurau coming in cinemas and on streaming later in March. Better yet, however, they’ve just added Diao Yinan’s dazzling The Wild Goose Lake to their 30-day streaming menu. The best film at Cannes last year not to win any kind of prize at all, it’s also been sold a bit short by not getting a cinema release. Don’t let it pass you by, however: this Chinese film noir is an eye-popping, screen-filling vision that deserves wider attention.If the English-language title of Diao’s film sounds like a play of “wild goose chase”, that’s probably accidental, but also not inappropriate. In this pileup of double- and triple-crossings in the ganglands of a fictional, seedy Chinese town, the looping, labyrinthine plot often feels like an exceptionally ornate bluff. Gradually you realise that all the neon-lit beauty you take in while running Diao’s elegant, breathless obstacle course is the real point.It begins, like many a great noir, with a shadowed meeting between a hardened criminal and an aloof femme fatale. Zhou (the superbly stoic Hu Ge) is on the run from the law after killing a cop prostitute Liu Aiai (Gwei Lun Mei) has come to deliver a message from his wife, but perhaps also has interest in the substantial price on his head. Further complexities unfold in flashback, as we learn how things unravelled for Zhou in a heist labelled “the Olympic Games of theft”: a madcap plan to steal a town’s worth of motorbikes in two hours. Diao’s film thrives on such demented details.Mistakes are made, spectacularly, and things get more and more tangled: if you lose the thread at some point and simply wallow in the film’s seamy, rain-soaked visual splendour and athletically choreographed action, that’s probably the idea, and you certainly won’t feel shortchanged. Though there’s a rich tradition of Asian thrillers that find lavish atmosphere in late-night noodle shops, bleak urban beaches and, perhaps more unusually, an after-hours zoo, they’re rarely presented with quite gravity-defying cinematic imagination. Revelling in hot pinks and sulphurous yellows, Diao and his ingenious cinematographer Dong Jinsong make a brilliant new world of this much-crossed terrain.More surprising is that Diao’s little-seen 2003 debut, Uniform, can be found streaming on Chili for a mere 90p. It’s a dark fable about a young factory worker who swipes a cop’s uniform from a laundrette and discovers the unearned power it wields when he slips it on. A simpler, scruffier study of inverted law and order than its successors, it’s a taut, witty treat in its own right – ripe for rediscovery as Diao’s luminous new film spreads its wings.Black and Blue (Sony, 15) A rookie cop goes on the run after witnessing a murder committed by corrupt boys in blue. Carried by a soulfully committed Naomie Harris, Deon Taylor’s old-school police thriller is spikier than generic outward appearances might suggest.Chained for Life (Anti-Worlds, 15) Ableism in Hollywood goes under the microscope in Aaron Schimberg’s pointed, cleverly metatextual satire, in which a conventionally beautiful movie star – playing the role of a blind person in a dubious disability drama – falls for her facially disfigured co-star.Terminator: Dark Fate (Fox, 15) After a run of desperate extensions to a mutated franchise, this back-to-basics return is a marked improvement, thanks largely to a front-and-centre role for 63-year-old Linda Hamilton’s resurgent Sarah Connor. But let’s leave things there, shall we?First Love (Signature, 15) Japanese genre workhorse Takashi Miike is so prolific that you can afford to skip several of his films in a row, but this cheerfully grisly Tokyo underworld caper is one of his keepers, stringing one beautifully staged knockabout action set piece after another.Studio Ghibli (Netflix) I discussed Netflix’s bonanza of films from the Japanese anime masters last month: a reminder that the second batch, including the essential Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, hits the service on Sunday.

By  Kieran MorrisFew restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce reciism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu.Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?”It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.Chefs were once courtiers then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes.The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce.Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.”The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”.Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.”One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.”So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”.Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”.What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey.El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary bioersity of Scandinavia.Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.”A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park.Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and bioersity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded iniduals in cooking and hospitality skills.Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.Roberto Flore, former head of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.”Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4601509156cc26ed30556b6245f3198f31b0ffbc/0_399_1996_1198/master/1996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11903dd81930f48191edbd7083d8d03","title":"emma hayes brian clough continental cup final chelsea arsenal women","story":"The outspoken Hayes takes her Chelsea team to the City Ground for Saturday’s showpiece against Arsenal and says the former Nottingham Forest manager has influenced her careerIt may be Chelsea’s first Continental Cup final but Emma Hayes is more overawed by the City Ground venue than the trophy.“The minute we got through I thought: ‘Oh God, I’m going to Cloughie’s home,’” says Chelsea’s manager, before her team take on the five-times winners Arsenal for the only domestic trophy to have eluded Chelsea.Hayes does not style herself on Brian Clough, though she may literally by wearing a green shirt in tribute, but she sees his influence in her teams and they way she conducts herself.“My father loves him and watched his teams a lot, and live. I went to a lot of Nottingham Forest games live when they were in London, so I’ve grown up always admiring his football, the type of football and his straight-talking, I guess.“I always think outspoken gets used – it gets misused. I find it refreshing to hear some honesty. That was a time where there probably was more honesty than there is now with managers. Let’s not forget he produced some brilliant football teams and is most remembered for that, I hope.”Hayes is definitely outspoken and it is a refreshing quality. In October, before Chelsea played Crystal Palace in the group stage, Hayes proclaimed the Football Association should “get rid of the Continental Cup” in favour of more league fixtures, saying: “Sell the Women’s Super League why are we diluting our product?”Now the tune has changed a little. It is not a complete switch, but as Chelsea have progressed so have Hayes’s views on the competition.“I’m an advocate of more games not less games. More games for me means more opportunities for younger players. So the Conti Cup, if it is to remain, should be to promote the development of younger players for the senior sides. Perhaps for the smaller clubs it helps boost their attendances and helps develop their players and we have to understand that. I think there could be a win-win with some small adjustments.”Win the tournament and a domestic treble will be in reach. However, despite Chelsea’s superiority in head-to-heads with Arsenal this season, Hayes believes their opponents’ record in this tournament means the odds are even.“This is Arsenal’s trophy,” she says. “This is the one they’ve won the most in recent years. This is the one they’ve dominated, so I expect a fight. I expect an aggressive Arsenal performance. I expect them to go around us, on the outside of the pitch, unlike the last game. I don’t think there is an underdog.”Lining up alongside Kerr will likely be Beth England, whose fight to earn her place at Chelsea after being sent on loan has paid off and is somewhat symbolic of the character the team have shown in coming from behind to win or draw nine league games this season.“You’ve got to have hardships,” Hayes says. “Too often, players think they’re going to come through their journeys and it’s a straight route to the top. She was never ready in her first year here and needed that loan. Has it been easy? We had to have difficult conversations, yes. Has she had to earn my trust? A million per cent, and that’s a real credit to her because rarely do you see that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b51d6484100772a33540808141f828ac06c2c9dc/207_226_3375_2026/master/3375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80e4bf20a1d446ff3bf7ff1946e02370","title":"norwich leicester premier league ","story":"Against the great escapologists of old, Norwich gave themselves genuine reason to believe a new Houdini act is possible. Nobody expects them to emulate Leicester in steaming on to win next season’s Premier League, but survival this year no longer seems out of the question and by one measure they are ahead of schedule. Back in 2014-15, Leicester began eating into a seven-point deficit with nine games to play Daniel Farke’s side are two matches better off and a campaign that had all but been explained away as a learning experience pulsates, at least for the next week or so, with fresh life.They deserved this win, only the second in their last 15 top-flight outings, against opponents whose deterioration in the final half-hour was a puzzle. Norwich’s tails were already up when, 20 minutes from time, their indefatigable right-back Max Aarons stole a yard on Ben Chilwell and spotted his colleague on the opposite flank making ground rapidly. Aarons crossed perceptively, bypassing everyone in the middle and allowing Jamal Lewis to size things up on the far side of the box. Lewis controlled with his chest and then, with impeccable technique, cut across the ball to spear a raking low volley across Kasper Schmeichel and send Carrow Road into raptures. Such a daring combination between two young full-backs epitomises why Norwich, who never want for ambition, would be widely popular jailbreakers. They have squandered inviting positions all season but this time never looked like allowing an increasingly flat Leicester, who should have been ahead by half-time and will point to VAR’s striking-off of a goal from Kelechi Iheanacho four minutes after the restart, a way back.“It was such a spirited and committed performance with a deserved win and a clean sheet it’s amazing,” Farke said. He was particularly pleased for Lewis, an exceptional 22-year-old whose season had been stalled by injury and the form of Sam Byram. “I’m unbelievably delighted for Jamal because he had a tough first season in the Premier League. He had to adapt to the level and then was out for 10 or 11 weeks.”His team had struggled towards the end of a watchable first half but Iheanacho, tasked with leading Leicester’s attack after a calf injury kept Jamie Vardy away, missed their best opportunity when he turned onto Ayoze Pérez’s cross before shooting over from seven yards. Dennis Praet also struck the outside of a post but none of that seemed to matter when Iheanacho found his bearings in spectacular fashion.He raced Ben Godfrey to a long pass and then, having foraged inside, curled unstoppably past Tim Krul. But it quickly became apparent that the ball had bounced off Godfrey’s upper arm and struck Iheanacho’s hand before he took aim the VAR decision to disallow the goal, confirmed by the Stockley Park-based Graham Scott, was correct under the current numbingly austere application of the rules but Brendan Rodgers was perplexed.“We’re obviously disappointed,” he said. “In the worst case scenario it’s a free-kick for us. I think it’s unintentional from the defender and then I don’t know what Kelechi can do when it drops and hits his hand.”He did not feel inclined to complain at length, though, even if his impression was that Leicester should not have lost. He acknowledged they had lacked the precision that has marked their past six months and admitted concern that 306 minutes have passed since their last goal. “We can’t dance around the truth,” he said. “We need to find that quality again.”They might have been expected to show more of it after Iheanacho’s disappointment, but instead Norwich seized their reprieve and fired two warning shots at Schmeichel via the outstanding Ondrej Duda before Lewis’s coup de grace. Leicester would meet an unlikely target of their own by reaching the Champions League but there is still time for a teetering season to unravel Norwich’s possibilities are now open to a degree that set Farke’s eyes ablaze.“It would be a little miracle,” he said of the prize before him. “But we are here to create something special and if we go on further on with this belief, this unity and commitment, there’s definitely a chance to do this.” He only had to look at the team in blue, vanquished though they were, for all the evidence he needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f43870d9f63d9ae90d5fe52e816e286391d6215/0_129_3865_2318/master/3865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc1abc94d7e3d20e4e864f8de2418356","title":"tell us do you have an inner voice","story":"We’d like to find out how you express thoughts in your head?

Here’s an hour-by-hour scheduleLeap Day is a date that should be more significant. Christmas, Halloween, Valentine’s Day those happen every year. But Leap Day? You have to wait four years for one. Which means that you’ll need to party four times as hard. Luckily, we’ve drawn up a detailed timetable in order for you to maximise your celebration ...Your alarm today is I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance) by Tina Charles, which Radio 1 named as the No 1 single on 29 February 1976. The only other song ever to reach No 1 on a Leap Day is a rerelease of Mysterious Girl by Peter Andre, and frankly you’re better than that.One of very few contemporary recording artists to have a birthday on 29 February, Ja Rule is literally the man of the hour. Listen to his hit Always on Time! Watch the trailer to his 2002 action film Half Past Dead! Get involved in a fraudulent, influencer-baiting music festival! He deserves this!Remember: if you are a woman, it is tradition to propose to your boyfriend today, and only today. If you don’t have a boyfriend, propose to anyone. If you’re not a woman, then make a woman propose to you. Tradition dictates it!I’ve checked Spotify, and some exist. One, by Terry v Tori, is all indie and jangly. One, by the Mystic Cowboys, is acoustic and depressing. One, by Cam Buma Project, is smooth jazz. One, by Jack Thought, sounds as if it came from a garden centre’s ambient CD collection. They’re all terrible, so go nuts.It isn’t her birthday, but she did become, on 29 February 1940, the first African American actor to win an Oscar. Why not watch Gone With the Wind and then stand around doing nothing for 51 years until Whoopi Goldberg becomes the second African American woman to win an acting Oscar?Only a handful of movies are set on 29 February, so you have a choice. Romantic comedy fans can watch the Amy Adams romcom Leap Year. Horror fans, you can watch the South Korean haunted-tollbooth film February 29. All other people, you’re out of luck.If today is 29 February, that means it must be time to rush out and buy the new issue of La Bougie du Sapeur (The Soldier’s Candle), the French satirical newspaper that only publishes once every four years. This is only its 11th issue, so well done for being such an early adopter.Just three Leap Days ago, Misha Defonseca finally admitted that her 1997 memoir Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years – in which she claimed to have spent the duration of the Holocaust living with wolves in the forest – was all made up. Commemorate this betrayal of trust by making up some rubbish about where you were during a time of international crisis. Maybe you were a passenger on the Titanic. Maybe Pearl Harbor interrupted your lunch. It’s your choice entirely!The most celebrated Leap Day reference in all of pop culture, in which Tina Fey created an entire tradition around 29 February, then made a Jim Carrey movie about it, then fed it into a sitcom episode. It tells the story of Leap Day William, who emerges every four years from the Mariana Trench to trade children’s tears for candy. It is perfect.Don’t forget, today is the birthday of U-Haul founder Leonard Shoen. As such, you are required to pack all your worldly goods into a trailer and leave your house for ever. Tradition dictates it!Don’t forget, time is running out. If you’re a woman and you haven’t proposed within the hour, you’ll remain sad and unmarried until at least 2024, by which time nuclear war might have killed most of the male population. Quickly!

I was brought up on a council estate and joined the army when I was 16. I felt quite rich as all I needed was beer money. After six years in the forces I moved into sales, selling telecoms and data network services and taking home about £150,000 including commission.My wife and I had a lavish life. I splashed out on flash cars, expensive suits and going out. We spent a lot on a barn that was far too big for us. I had a disrespect for money.Then in 2013 I put everything on the line when I decided to launch my own telecoms company. We sold the house and the cars and raised £200,000 to cover the shortfall in wages for the first four years. Those were scary times but I had a strong gut feeling it would work.For years it was a struggle, especially as the cash was running out. Thankfully the risk paid off: my company, Vapour Cloud, now employs 20 people in Halifax, and turnover is set to exceed £4m this year. That whole journey led me to have a healthier regard for money.A decade ago, our joint income totalled about £200,000. But after starting the business, we had to learn to rely on about £80,000. Our first daughter was an IVF baby and it took three chances for her to be conceived. After that struggle, the pair of us made a conscious decision for my wife to stay at home and support the family.Now I’m earning good money again, so things are more comfortable. I take £80,000 out of the business plus a bonus. The salespeople earn more than me but they are the guys who make the money for the business. I feel it’s important that the boss isn’t taking all the money out.We rent a four-bedroom house as we don’t have enough money to buy a property. However, in the next 12 to 24 months we’re looking to take cash out of the business to buy a house. I doubt it will be as big as the five-bedroom barn we used to live in. Our rent is about £1,500 a month. I’m not sure how much bills come to – maybe £600 a month. But I don’t know for sure I stay away from that. When it comes to food shopping, we like to eat well. Our food bill is about £250 to £300 a month.I plan to upgrade our cars in the next 18 months – we have an Audi A6 and a 10-year-old Lexus 4x4. We’ll probably buy a Land Rover as the family car, then I might treat myself to an electric Porsche, which would cost in the region of £100,000.Once a year we visit Miami for two weeks as my sister-in-law lives there, so we don’t have to pay for accommodation. Saying that, it’s not cheap when we’re there, but the children love it. When you’re a salesperson you think you’re the bee’s knees, so I was always buying expensive clothes such as handmade suits. I still love fashion and I like to dress smartly for work but, back in the day, I’d splash out on labels such as Armani and Versace. But those days are gone. Although I did just buy a new velvet Boss tuxedo for £800, I won’t spend £2,000 on a jacket any more. I now only buy clothes when I need something.It’s my 50th birthday this year and I’m planning to book an adventure trip through my cousin’s company, the Extreme Leaders. It offers trips such as trekking to the north pole. That’ll cost me £5,000-£10,000. I hope to raise money for a charity such as the Fertility Foundation.I’ve developed a healthier relationship with money. Before I’d spend without thinking now I’ve calmed down and think about the future. I have life insurance, which costs £225 a month, and a pension. My dad died of a heart attack when I was 13, and it’s made me conscious about being fit. I want to see my kids grow up. When my dad left, we were goosed. We lived in a council house and mum worked part time. It was a struggle. I want to build a substantial pot to ensure everyone is looked after.As told to Suzanne Bearne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214fea0779b4daecfce207fbd29bb82e9611afd5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8faa20e2a73866249769d7fa35e55789","title":"india modi and the rise of hindu nationalism","story":"With Delhi rocked by deadly protests as Muslim and Hindu groups clash violently,  writer Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism within India.

That makes sense given the complexity of many transactions. Worth noting, that is with skilled, trained, experienced labour.“So if we are dealing with 200m extra declarations, at a productivity rate of 4,000 per year that equals 50,000 staff needed on day one, and probably more.” Gove has access to about £7.5m to fund new HRMC customs agents but may seek funds from the wider Border Delivery Group cross-department initiative to prepare for 1 January 2021.Neighbouring countries including France, the Netherlands and Ireland launched customs officials recruitment drives last year, with six-month training schedules considered a minimum.Agents in Dover who deal with lorries coming in from the Ukraine, Turkey and other non-EU countries have warned that the skills base around customs disappeared with the creation of the single market in 1991, with just a handful of customs agents now operating in offices in Dover.The emergence of the human resource needed puts into perspective the scale of the task – the number of staff needed dwarfs the 12,000 people estimated to work in the fishing industry, a sector emblematic of Brexit.Government sources have said the new recruits would largely be “intermediaries”, agents who help businesses process their export and import paperwork with HMRC.The tax authorities will also recruit government agents to process the paperwork and guard against tariff evasion on borders.The Freight Transport Association and the RHA have been pressing the government for the past three years to wake up to the realities of a hard Brexit.The FTA said Thursday’s publication of the government’s negotiating goals gave some “hope” in that it provided confirmation that the government was not pursuing frictionless trade.However, it called for “more ambition” to help road, aviation and rail transport prepare to minimise the disruption from 1 January.“Over recent months, the FTA has repeatedly requested the UK government prioritise the needs of logistics in its negotiations around the future trading relationship with the EU or risk a devastating effect on the UK’s highly interconnected supply chain. The business organisation has also warned of knock-on effects on UK plc’s future productivity, and on the economy as a whole but these concerns seem to have been overlooked,” it said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5cd7f2be3be9877572e33f70791cb41966e4177/0_73_4208_2525/master/4208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab7c65cc950932dd416b0a927cf1e15d","title":"who is the real priti patel","story":"Rude, dismissive and hostile, or friendly and self-deprecating? The home secretary ides opinionThe story goes like this: when the news that Priti Patel had stepped down as international development secretary spread through her department, some civil servants burst into an impromptu singalong of Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead.While largely told secondhand, the vignette illustrates a current political truth about Patel, that someone who not many years ago was regularly tipped as a future prime minister is now among the most isive figures in Westminster.It is common for there to be mixed feelings towards politicians, but views on Patel, now Boris Johnson’s home secretary, appear particularly split. Some former colleagues, even opposition MPs, speak of her as approachable, friendly and self-deprecating. But certain civil servants and officials tell a very different story.Following a series of claims about bullying behaviour at the Home Office – vehemently rejected by Patel’s allies – several sources have made similar claims to the  about when Patel was international development secretary. Her tenure in that role ended abruptly in 2017 when it emerged she had failed to tell Theresa May about meetings with Israeli politicians and officials while supposedly on holiday.One official who witnessed Patel at the Department for International Development (DfID) said her behaviour there was “as bad as the stories say”, with staff ranging from her private ministerial office to senior civil servants having “really suffered”.The official said: “While the word ‘bullying’ is used, with her it’s not really personal, as if she took a dislike to certain people, it was her typical manner. One minute she would come across rude or ungrateful, and another she would be being dismissive or hostile in the face of advice. It was difficult for the people who experienced it.”Such behaviour was not universal, they said. “I doubt you’ll hear politicians saying any of this. I think she’s been careful about how she’s presented herself all these years. And she can be the most charming person, people feel drawn to her.”The official said they had not spoken out before. “I’m not saying this because I want her to be removed from office. But the whole thing doesn’t feel right. At the end of the day, it’s not right to treat people the way she does.”Another official familiar with Patel’s period at DfID backed this up, saying the recent allegations “did not come as a surprise, because she had a reputation for being a bully”. They added that many had been “traumatised” from her time in the department.In contrast, one Conservative figure who worked with Patel when she was a junior minister recalled that at the time she was “mainly notorious for being very nice, friendly and happy to help”.One constant in Patel’s political life has been her beliefs. A career-long Eurosceptic, she holds views on law and order sufficiently robust that she famously spoke in favour of the death penalty on the BBC’s Question Time in 2011, a view she now disowns.While her position on the right of the Conservatives made her something of an outlier when she first became an MP in 2010 during the David Cameron years, it now chimes happily with Boris Johnson’s government.The child of Gujarati Indian parents who fled to the UK from Uganda just before Idi Amin’s decision to deport all Asians, Patel shares a love of Margaret Thatcher with her father, Sushil, who built up a chain of newsagents and once stood for Ukip in council elections.As a new MP, Patel was one of the contributors to Britannia Unchained, a 2012 book of Thatcher-on-steroids essays calling for lower taxes and massive economic deregulation, with one section famously describing Britons as “among the worst idlers in the world”.Like her co-authors Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, Patel now has a senior cabinet job, even if, paradoxically, she finds herself in a government publicly committed to increases in public spending and maintaining EU-level standards and regulations.Patel’s trenchant views have alarmed some critics during her ascent. When she took over at DfID, one charity even went to the trouble of compiling a cuttings dossier of her previous statements calling for the aid budget to be reduced or redistributed.Similarly, her appointment to the Home Office prompted rights groups to raise her previous comments on areas including immigration, asylum and criminal justice – not least the death penalty.While she is, in ministerial terms, just one step away from No 10, Patel is now rarely talked about as a future PM, despite a capacity for hard work and the ability, even acknowledged by her enemies, to be hugely charming.One former Labour MP who worked with Patel on cross-party matters said he “disagrees with her fundamentally on pretty much everything” in politics, but nonetheless called her “nice, normal and fun”. He said: “To me she always seemed like one of those MPs who doesn’t take it all too seriously, which can be a curse in Westminster.”The lowering of expectations for her career seems to have several causes. One is a seeming capacity for political misjudgment, notably her extracurricular visit to Israel, which baffled and outraged May and her team.Patel’s decision to hold a dozen unauthorised work meetings during what was billed as a family holiday, including with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, seemed motivated by her vigorous opinions on foreign policy, apparently influenced by her ties to strongly pro-Israel and pro-US groups such as the Henry Jackson Society.Most of all, weeks of allegations about bullying and fallings-out with senior civil servants, coupled with reports that she sought to have the director of communications at the Home Office removed just before Christmas, have clearly damaged Patel’s reputation, for all the counter-briefing by allies.But at the same time, Patel’s allies are vehement her reputation is unfair. One official who worked closely with her at her Home Office said she has “the hardest job in British politics”.They said: “Personally, I loved working for Priti. She is an extremely motivated and demanding boss, sure, but also incredibly kind. Frankly, I find the allegations of bullying ridiculous. I’ve never seen anything that even vaguely resembles it.”Born: 29 March 1972 in north London.Career: Educated at state schools, then Keele and Essex Universities. After stints as a press officer for both the Referendum party and the Conservatives, she worked in corporate PR for Weber Shandwick, and for the drinks giant Diageo. Having become an MP in 2010 she had junior ministerial roles in the Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions under David Cameron, before Theresa May made her international development secretary.High point: Returning to the cabinet as home secretary under Boris Johnson.Low point: Being forced to resign by May after failing to tell the PM about unofficial meetings in Israel.She says: “As the daughter of a migrant, I know the sanctuary, welcome and opportunities that Britain provides. Regaining control of our borders does not mean slamming the door shut.”They say: “Priti Patel is a politician with a consistent record of voting against basic human rights protections. For her to be put in charge of the Home Office is extremely concerning,” – rights group Liberty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

The furore sparked by the recent decision to cut funding for the Championship has revealed a fault line running throughout rugby union in England. It might best be termed as the tension between recreation and ambition, community and elitism, the amateur ethos and the professional.The question has never quite been resolved since professionalism. What is the purpose of the clubs beneath the elite? What is the purpose of the sprawling, seamless pyramid of leagues in which they play? There are those at the heart of it now proclaiming the future death of grassroots rugby, a slow strangling of the community game.The RFU is midway through its latest review to try to settle on a system that might better cater for the needs of more than 1,500 rugby clubs among its membership. The adult male future competitions survey on the RFU website will continue to accept submissions until it closes next Friday. Clubs are urged to have their say.Unanimity of opinion is not expected. “The great thing about our game,” says Steve Grainger, the RFU’s rugby development director, “is there’s so much ersity of thinking. The biggest challenge in our game is there’s so much ersity of thinking.”This chimes with the results from a survey of more than 350 clubs from across all the regions and levels of rugby in England for my recently published book on rugby in the 21st century, Unholy Union: When Rugby Collided with the Modern World. In the hundreds of supplementary comments, the refrain that a ring-fencing of the elite game would be the death of their club was common, but not as common as the lament that the league system itself was killing the community game.The insidious effect of the seamless structure is to institutionalise the idea of ambition, the notion that anyone can make it to the top. The effect of the professional era has been to normalise the idea of paying players to pimp up your first team. In the Unholy Union survey there were reports of payments to players as low as level nine. One club in level 12, the lowest rung of the current system, said it pays expenses for its first XV. Four clubs across levels seven, eight and nine said they harbour ambitions to reach the Premiership.All of which introduces an element of toxicity into the structure. It takes only one or two teams in a region or league to start paying players to make others feel the pressure to respond, just so they can hang on to their own or maintain their position. Across any few years of the professional era, one can chart the rise, and usually fall, of ‘ambitious’ clubs through the league structure. These shooting stars are invariably fuelled not by a golden generation of local talent but by the money of wealthy iniduals, which in turn prioritises investment in the first XV, the standard by which so many clubs seem to judge themselves.“If I walk into a club and ask how things are going,” says Grainger, “the answer is always about the first XV. What you want to hear is how a club fielded four teams for the first time or developed a second women’s team, age group and minis. It’s that holistic view.”Taken with developments in the wider world, the prioritising of the first XV has had a withering effect on the community game since the leagues were introduced in 1987, quite alarmingly so if the measure is fixtures played. The last time the RFU conducted a review of the league structures, in 2014, they pulled out the examples of two clubs, Morpeth and Harrow. In the 1982-3 season, each played more than 180 fixtures across six XVs 40 years later Morpeth played 86 across four and Harrow 56 across two.Suffering injuries and the fear of injury are two of the three most cited reasons for players dropping out of rugby. The other is travel. In a culture of changing work patterns, more enlightened approaches to parenting and an increased accent on inidualism, the traditional model of the rugby club has been transformed, as has each player’s commitment to it.Level four club\u0026nbspIf the Premiership is ringfenced expect an exodus of financial backers from the lower league clubs and the eventual demise of grassroots rugbyLevel four club Soon we will only have the larger clubs, less rugby being played below first-team level and too much there. It is the young players who are burning out, playing too many games in a hostile environmentLevel six club We could not have survived financially but for ersification, which brings in far more income than rugby aloneLevel seven club Clubs within our county who have a short-term ‘let’s buy success to feed our ego’ attitude cause great harm to our gameLevel eight club The real issue is the lack of recreational rugby being played. By promoting elitism you dampen the\u0026nbspjoyLevel eight club The grassroots game is collapsing in terms of number of teams playing. The RFU seems to be concentrating on the England teams only and their fear of a split from professional rugby. That might not be a\u0026nbspbad\u0026nbspthingLevel 10 club Bigger clubs in our area get bigger,\u0026nbspwhile smaller clubs are strugglingRugby, at all levels, is an increasingly punishing game. The only other team sport in the world that might be further along the collision spectrum is American football. It is telling that no one has even tried to establish an adult community game there. The model works. The NFL is the biggest spectator sport in the world by average attendance and needs only a supply line of youth to keep it viable, players dropping out of the system as they grow older, until only the elite continue into adulthood. There is a fear that this is the future towards which rugby is heading.The current review of the league structure is not the first. From 2012 to 2014, the RFU canvassed the views of players around the country and devised a new structure designed to reduce the number of league games and the amount of travel. The uproar among, tellingly, the administrators of various clubs was loud and decisive, citing the loss of home fixtures and an expected dilution in playing standards. It is not only at elite level that the imperatives of player welfare and revenue generation war with each other.The Northern Action Group was formed, through which a collection of clubs in the north threatened to break away if the restructure went ahead. With a World Cup to host on the horizon, the RFU agreed to shelve it rather than risk mutiny. Ironically, within two years, another group of clubs from Lancashire broke away from the league system to form two isions of a mini-league of their own, citing the burden of excessive travel.Reports of their new arrangement are encouraging, but even that has come at a cost. Those left languishing in the farther reaches of Cumbria seethe at the consequent reduction in their fixtures and the dilution of playing standards. These are issues facing any league system, but this time the hope is for a more open mind among the RFU’s membership to the concept of a restructure.If ring-fencing the elite game, whether at Premiership level or Championship level or both, ever comes to pass, it is likely to be independent of the current review. Which is not to say the RFU would be against it. Many clubs struggling at adult level are now sustained by the vibrancy of their minis sections, which have boomed since the 1990s, but rugby’s current great growth area is the women’s game. The Tyrrell’s Premier 15s is an example of just such a set-up, with membership of the elite established by application, not by results on the field.“We’re just at the beginning with the women’s game,” says Grainger, “but that gives us a good opportunity not to go down the same path as the men’s. I won’t say make the same mistakes! We want a community that is flourishing through rugby, where rugby is flourishing through the community. What does that look like? Don’t know yet. We’re at a watershed.”In an undoubtedly challenging environment, beset by social pressures way beyond its control, community rugby needs to decide what it wants to be. That means inidual clubs deciding. The wise ones will focus on the joy of playing and their status as community centres. The wise clubs will leave ambition to the elite."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57611927ba482e7106007b3c6ec03d55e0089d2c/0_150_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c014367302550ba0943fa0d7c46af6d3","title":"sun yang benefited from convenient friendship with swimmings chiefs","story":"In the Sun Yang case the only thing clear about the way Fina runs swimming is the water in the poolIn August 2016, two years after Sun Yang was banned for three months because he’d been caught using an illegal stimulant, he won the Olympic 200m freestyle. It was his third gold medal, after his victories in the 400m and 1500m at London 2012. Sun explained the drug was medication for a heart problem. Still, it’s fair to say that some people there weren’t too happy about it. Australian freestyler Mack Horton called him a “drugs cheat”, French backstroker Camille Lacourt said he “pisses purple”. Others, though, seemed to be genuinely pleased for him. Particularly Cornel Marculescu, the executive director of Fina, the international swimming federation, who gave Sun a long hug after he stepped off the podium.Afterwards, Sun explained that Marculescu had been “like a grandfather” to him. “He is a very good friend of the Chinese swim team,” he said. “So I was very happy to see him see me win the gold. I hope this friendship will last.” It did. A year later, Fina made a special point of celebrating “this friendship” at its World Aquatics Gala in the Chinese city of Sanya, when it presented Sun with a bespoke award for “Outstanding Contribution to Swimming Popularity in China”. Asked about it afterwards, a Fina spokesman told Inside the Games the award had been made at “the request of the China Swimming Association”.You don’t need goggles to see to the bottom of this relationship. At that same gala Fina’s president, Julio Maglione, spoke about how “China is surely a very valuable partner for Fina”. He was especially keen to stress the commercial benefits of the relationship. “The Chinese market is a very vibrant one,” he said. “This represents countless business opportunities for Western brands.” China, Maglione added, is “one of the most committed countries in the promotion of aquatics. And the results are quite fruitful: Chinese athletes are shining at the highest level at Fina competitions.” None brighter than Sun.In the world of swimming, everyone knows how Maglione and Marculescu run the sport. Maglione, 84, has been president for 10 years, Marculescu, 78, has been executive director for 34. Between them, they’ve weathered a series of scandals. The Sun Yang case is the biggest yet.The question facing them now is whether “this friendship” had any bearing on the way Fina has behaved since the Sunday Times broke the story that Sun had missed an out-of-competition drugs test in 2018 because he had got into a row with the team who had come to do the testing. The argument ended with one of Sun’s entourage smashing the vials containing his blood samples. Fina’s doping panel held an inquiry, which found the officials doing the testing hadn’t followed the correct protocols, so the samples weren’t valid. Which meant that whatever else he’d taken a hammer to, Sun hadn’t broken any rules.Last July, Sun won two more gold medals at the world championship in Gwangju. Horton refused to share a podium with him, so did Scottish freestyler Duncan Scott. Sun blew up. “You’re a loser,” he told Scott as they walked off. “I’m a winner.” In private, Fina warned all three about their conduct, but in public Marculescu singled out Horton and Scott. “It’s unfortunate,” he said, of two men who were protesting their right to compete in a clean sport. “We regret they put the sport in disrepute.” Soon after, Fina rushed through new rules compelling all medal winners to stand on the podium and banning them from making “political statements”.Meanwhile, the World Anti-Doping Agency launched an appeal against the Fina decision at the court of arbitration for sport. And it has now come to a very different conclusion to the one Fina reached. It has ruled that the doping officials had followed protocol, so Sun was guilty of tampering with his samples. The key point in the Cas ruling is this: “It is one thing to question the accreditation of the testing personnel while keeping the intact samples in the possession of the testing authorities it is quite another thing, after lengthy exchanges and warnings as to the consequences, to act in such a way that results in destroying the sample containers, thereby eliminating any chance of testing the sample at a later stage.”You might have expected Fina to remain studiously neutral in all this. But it recently emerged that behind the scenes it had supported an effort made in the Swiss courts to stop Wada’s lead prosecutor, Richard Young, from participating in the Cas hearing. Young had previously served on Fina’s legal commission but stood down to work for Wada on this case. Still, Sun’s lawyers, with Fina’s help, tried to force him to stand down because of a possible conflict of interest. They failed. Fina also sided with Sun’s legal team in a second complaint against Wada’s appeal hearing, when they raised a plea of inadmissibility because of the alleged late filing of Wada’s brief.It’s not clear how Fina’s doping panel and Cas could draw two such distinct verdicts from the one set of facts about what Sun did that night. It’s not clear why Fina decided to involve itself in Sun’s defence. It’s not clear why it cooperated in two attempts to hinder Wada’s appeal against their verdict. Right now, about the only thing that is clear about the way Fina runs this sport is the water in the pool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ef55551623229cd6e8272f8422d5ca0332dfb92/0_73_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f3c9a9aed8dc664977e8f62d5db616c","title":"talking horses not another muddle can strike gold at newbury horse racing tips","story":"The selection was memorably impressive at Sandown around this time last year and goes well fresh after a breakFive wins in seven years is an impressive record for any trainer in a handicap, so the three Paul Nicholls runners in Saturday’s Greatwood Gold Cup must be given lots of respect. But the Somerset trainer, who is in excellent form as so often at this time of year, may get worried out of the Newbury prize on this occasion by a long-absent runner from the Gary Moore yard.Not Another Muddle (3.15) was memorably impressive at Sandown about this time last year and looked good for a long way when tried in the Grand Annual the following month. Mistakes undermined his chance that day, so this return to a flatter course may help a lot.He is still ahead of his rating when things fall right for him. The obvious risk is the fact that he hasn’t been seen since April but he has gone well fresh in the past and odds of 12-1 provide fair compensation. Bennys King, so narrowly beaten at Ascot last time, should go close again.1.50 Doncaster This weather is ideal for Blackjack Kentucky, who “can’t have it soft enough”, according to Nicholls. He’s been given a fair mark for this handicap debut, despite an authoritative performance at Chepstow last month.2.05 Newbury Unseating at the 16th was a disappointing way for Horatio Hornblower to exit the veterans’ final but it may help here unlike Dark Flame and Theatre Guide, he was spared having to slog all the way to the line at Sandown last month. Twice a winner this season, he gets a non-claiming rider for the first time since April.2.25 Doncaster On what could be a great card for Nicholls, Dolos can follow up on his recent Sandown success, when he was giving 22lb to the runner-up, First Flow. That one has upheld the form with two wide-margin victories in the past fortnight. Gino Trail is interesting on his debut for Fergal O’Brien but is 13 now.2.45 Kelso Calva D’Auge deserves his place after a couple of battling wins but ratings suggest he has nothing in hand on these terms with Clondaw Caitlin, who has been really impressive in a couple of mares’ hurdles. The mudlover can make her sex allowance tell.3.00 Doncaster Clear of her rivals by 8lb on official ratings, Cill Anna is a worthy odds-on shot. Her Wincanton success last time was easily a career best, so she is going the right way.3.35 Doncaster The fitting of blinkers has done plenty for Worthy Farm, who has won his last two races in them. It looked as though he could be a fair way ahead of his mark at Wincanton last month and a half-stone rise is reasonable. He has his quirks but may be worth chancing. Chris CookSupporters of Epatante, who was displaced as favourite for the -Champion Hurdle on Thursday following a report that she had been intermittently coughing, received a more encouraging update from Nicky Henderson on Friday night when the trainer confirmed that his mare remains “on course” for hurdling’s championship race.“But that is what they are making you do. She has not coughed this morning and we are all on course.”Epatante had been the clear favourite for the Champion Hurdle for two months following her impressive success in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, but she is currently second-favourite with all major layers at a top-price of 9-2. Willie Mullins’s Benie Des Dieux, who has an alternative option at the Festival in the Mares’ Hurdle the same afternoon, heads the market at 3-1, while Pentland Hills, a stable companion of Epatante, is next in the betting at 5-1.No inspections are currently planned for Saturday’s three meetings over jumps in Britain ahead of the arrival of the latest storm from the Atlantic, but the meeting at Navan in Ireland, which was due to include the Grade Three Flyingbolt Novice Chase, has been postponed with details on a rearranged date to follow. Monday’s card at Chepstow has also succumbed to waterlogging, after 25mm fell at the Welsh track up to 3pm on Friday.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d0523a825a137aab6ecbb2553362d1ba5d3f05/0_227_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f984ec6f11a77ea2b4949aee20f46782","title":"bothy mountain huts scotland highlands walking routes hikes highlands","story":"Explore some of the most stunning scenery in Scotland with this pick of wilderness walks from a new guide to routes that take in free bothiesWhy do it? An adventurous round of Lochnagar’s awe-inspiring north-east corrie from Gelder Shiel Stable, with grandstand views of the crags towering over the loch that gives the mountain its nameDistance 13 miles 6.5-8 hours over two days (in summer conditions)Grade StraightforwardRising nobly above Royal Deeside, on the edge of the sprawling Mounth plateau, Lochnagar is one of the most celebrated hills in the Cairngorms. The mountain is the focal point of the southern quarter of this vast, protected region, its most prominent feature a huge amphitheatre of fractured granite buttresses that inspired Byron’s rousing 1807 poem, Lachin Y Gair.After stowing your overnight bag, pack a day sack and set out across the undulating, heather-clad moraines that sweep down from the corrie of Lochnagar (the seven-mile round trip will take about five hours). When the track abruptly stops, continue on a faint trail that plots a steady course up towards the high crags. Off-piste, away from the crowds, you become accustomed to the startled cries of black grouse as they shoot skywards from the undergrowth, and the sight of mountain hares dashing between the boulders piled up before the coire lip. Suddenly the dark, curving lochan appears, and above it the imposing crags. The breathtaking scale of the scene is only truly evident if there are climbers on the rock face. Since the early days of Scottish mountaineering, the vertiginous crags have attracted a succession of hardy mountaineers.From the outflow of the Lochnagar Burn, climb to the bealach (pass) south of Meikle Pap, looking back for spectacular views of the coire, which quickly feels a world away. Now pick up the well-worn trail leading up from Glen Muick and traverse the edge of the cliffs to the summit, Cac Carn Beag. On a clear day, a splendid panorama unfolds: Ben Macdui and the central Cairngorm plateau are steadfast in the north-west, while the huge whaleback of Beinn a’Bhùird and the distinctive tors of Ben Avon dominate the skyline above Deeside.To complete the circular walk back to Gelder Shiel, descend steeply north-west to a bealach (pass) then follow the stream down to the corrie of Lochnagar and seek out the path back to the bothy. Settle in for the night, before the leisurely walk back to Balmoral the following morning.• Open all year. Contact the Balmoral Estate (01339 742534) before planning a trip between 1 September and 20 OctoberWhy do it? This is one of Scotland’s finest mountain walks, stopping off at Suileag bothy, under Suilven’s formidable sandstone buttresses. There are wonderful views from the summit dome over Assynt’s rugged peaks and ribbon lochsDistance 12 miles 6-8 hours over two days Grade StraightforwardOnce through the estate buildings, take the stalkers’ path just beyond Loch Druim Suardalain and out on to the open moor. The turn to Suileag bothy is marked by a cairn and soon comes into view. Named from the Gaelic for “little eye” or “loop”, it’s a long, single-storey stone cottage with an impressive view of Suilven from the front door. There’s room for half a dozen people, so if you arrive early, bag a space on one of the sleeping platforms for your return after the day’s climb.From the bothy, head towards the foot of Suilven and climb the steep slope to Bealach Mòr. The anticipation builds as you approach the summit ridge, and the view does not disappoint. The sweeping profiles of Cùl Mòr, Stac Pollaidh and Ben More Coigach stretch off to the south, beyond the mesmerising curves of Fionn Loch and Loch Sionasgaig, while to the north, there are tantalising glimpses of Foinaven and Ben Hope beyond Quinag’s complex ridgeline. Turn west through a gap in a drystone dyke and up on to the summit dome, the view of protected wilderness expanding with every stride. There are a couple of rock steps to negotiate, but nothing too hard. At 731 metres, Suilven’s summit is relatively low, but it punches well above its weight. Return triumphant to the bothy, retracing your steps down the slope, and settle in for a night by the fire (the seven-mile round trip should take about five hours) or continue to the car park if you’re heading home. Whatever the weather, this is an unforgettable expedition.• Suileag bothy is open all year round, but closed from 6-13 June for a work party. Loch fishing by permit only. Dogs not permitted. Further details at assynt-foundationWhy do it? This three-day round trip takes in two beautiful bothies along the remote, uncompromising northern shore of Loch Tarbert on Jura. A haven for wildlife, this is among the finest landscapes in ScotlandDistance 17 miles 12 hours over three daysGrade ChallengingThe westward-facing seaboard of Jura has been sculpted into a procession of quartzite cliffs, caves and raised beaches that are as remote and inaccessible as any in Scotland. A world away from Glasgow, but barely 50 miles as the crow flies, it is home to a large population of red deer and wild goats that roam the open moorland. Golden eagles and buzzards soar, and otters and grey seals share the rocky skerries. Traversing this untamed coastline is a true voyage of discovery.Head west across the mudflats at the outflow of Loch Tarbert, and negotiate a patchwork of peat bog and tussock grass down to the coast, using intermittent deer tracks. Jura derives its name from the Old Norse for “deer island” – and the local herd significantly outnumber humans. Finally, spy Cruib bothy, in the corner of a secret cove, about three hours after you set off (the walk is 3¾ miles). Expertly renovated in 2012, the bothy’s communal room would not look out of place in a hostel, with a sleeping platform, armchairs and a heaving bookshelf above the fireplace.Suitably rested, set out on a circular day trip to Ruantallain bothy. Pick up a track leading west over the moor and on to the promontory, where the bothy lies behind a low bluff in a show-stopping location. The view south is framed by Loch Tarbert and the Paps of Jura, and from the point there is a rare view of Colonsay, last stop before Newfoundland. Wildlife is plentiful. Along with the red deer and wild goats, otters and grey seals are regular visitors, and shags and cormorants perch on the rocks.Why do it? This is a daring expedition through superb hiking country, with an overnight stop at Sourlies, one of the most popular bothies in Scotland. And this remote, rugged terrain can be accessed via public transport Distance 27 miles 17 hours over twothree daysGrade ChallengingRenowned for its steep-sided peaks, deep lochs and wild, challenging terrain, the Rough Bounds boasts some of Scotland’s finest mountain scenery. And by happy coincidence it also has the highest concentration of bothies in the country. There are several possible through-routes linking these remote shelters, but this expedition is the pick of the bunch.Only accessible by boat or on foot, the tiny village of Inverie, on the western shore of the Knoydart peninsula, has a unique atmosphere. Arriving by ferry from the rail terminus at Mallaig, leave the day-trippers behind and walk through the village past the tempting pub (the Old Forge may be the most remote hostelry in mainland Britain) and out into the open glen. Now head along the Inverie River into Gleann Meadail, up over the saddle and down to the ghostly ruin at Carnoch.Loch Nevis is soon within reach, where an obvious path climbs to higher ground then down to Sourlies bothy (56.9935, -5.5190), above the mud flats at the head of the loch (the 9¼ miles will take about six hours to complete). After the hard-earned walk in, there is a real sense of satisfaction as you soak in a fjord-like landscape that could be Norway or New Zealand.This bothy is deservedly popular, though it is just a small, single-room shelter, so in the summer, be prepared to camp just outside.If you are hoping to catch the evening train from Glenfinnan, you need to crack on in the morning. From Sourlies, head over the watershed into Glen Dessarry and down to A’Chuil bothy tucked away below a blanket of conifers on the far side of the glen (allow four hours for the five-mile hike). You could spend the night here, or just take a well-earned rest.Continue round into Glen Pean and up to the Bealach a’ Chaorainn. Descend steeply to Corryhully bothy for a final pit stop. A few hundred yards before the main road, pass under the Glenfinnan Viaduct (better known these days as the Harry Potter bridge) and on to the railway station at Glenfinnan (about 13 miles and seven hours from Sourlies), taking in views of the northern end of Loch Sheil .Returning on the train you feel a real sense of achievement. The walk is a challenging one for one nighttwo days, but using A’Chuil bothy means this can become a two-nightthree-day adventure.• Both bothies are open throughout the year. Keep to main paths during the stalking season (September-February) Why do it? This is a classic two-day expedition through the vast upland moors of the central Highlands, staying overnight in the atmospheric and reputedly haunted bothy of Ben Alder CottageDistance 18.5 miles 9-11 hours over two daysGrade StraightforwardSince the 1920s, stravaigers (wanderers) and walkers have sought solitude in the empty quarter of the sprawling Grampian mountains, bounded by the West Highland Railway and the road over Drumochter Pass from Blair Atholl to Aviemore. Dominated by the Ben Alder plateau and the long, muscular arm of Loch Ericht, this remote region is notable for the absence of public roads, houses or people. This exceptional weekend expedition takes you into the heart of this brooding wilderness, utilising consecutive stops on the railway line.Above a semicircular, lochside bay, Ben Alder Cottage has long had a reputation for being haunted, though this has not affected its popularity. The bothy is very comfortable, with bunk beds in a separate dormitory, as well as sleeping platforms in the two communal rooms.After (hopefully) a good night’s sleep, the walk will take you on to Corrour station for an evening train – allow six hours to cover the 10 miles. First, head up the stalkers’ path to the pass on the plateau’s southern flank, and descend to the Uisge Labhair river, which is clearly visible. After crossing the river, follow an obvious trail down to beautiful, tree-lined Loch Ossian. Continue round the loch and on to the station. The warm embrace of the Station House cafe is a fine reward for your endeavours (open from the end of March to the end of October) before you catch your train.• Open all year with unrestricted access. During deer control (mid-August to 15 February) stick to paths where possible and use prominent ridges to access the hilltops. Ben Alder Estate: 01540 672000Bothies are open shelters with no booking system or warden. Just turn up with all the items you would take camping, plus candles and fuel for the fire. Bothies have no facilities (gas, electricity or tap), but with a bit of initiative can become a cosy home from home. Many have sleeping platforms and woodburning stoves. Use fast-flowing streams for water. Hill walking in winter requires specialist equipment and experience. For the uninitiated, attending a winter skills course is essential before any unguided treks are attempted. Before setting out on any of these routes, be mindful of the forecast. The weather conditions can quickly deteriorate, making navigation particularly difficult, especially in winter.Geoff Allan is author of Scottish Bothy Walks: Scotland’s 28 Best Bothy Adventures, published on 1 March (Wild Things Publishing, £16.99)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

She was, in the way that is specific to pop figures we engage with daily, a friend, albeit one I had never met. That raspy voice, her surprised guffaw, her dresses (pretty, bordering on wacky, like early Cher) and the empathy she brought to a bloodless and occasionally unkind television format lent her an air of approachable glamour, a local-girl-done-good sheen, aspirational but earthy.Not since I saw Sarah Jessica Parker on Broadway in 1996, belting her heart out with a childlike vibrato, had I hungered so deeply for information about a star. I pored over Flack’s Instagram, over dailymail images of her pink-doored flat (I’m not proud of this), and histories of her love interests (most of whom were only figures of note to me because they had been pictured holding her hand outside a nightclub). I read her deceptively sunny memoir, Storm In A C Cup, and took comfort in her durable, bounce-back brand of vulnerability. Her quotes about heartbreak (“I feel at my most calm, in control and happiest when I’m single, so at the minute that’s what I’m doing”) reassured me, yet still I cheered “Good for her!” when she was pictured on the beach in Ibiza with her latest athlete beau. Despite being on fairly intimate terms with the mechanics of celebrity, I felt sure we were connected. Caroline would like me. She would get it. I got her. I am clearly far from the only person who felt this way, which is why her every move, hairstyle and misstep were clocked and noted by the country at large.This adoration, this childish sense of connection, is only a small part of why her death hit me with a sickening power. While I am not often at a loss for words, I felt that weighing in – especially with a Twitter micro-tribute – would be useless and borderline disrespectful. I am fairly allergic to the culture around celebrity death announcements. When the latest loss hits the timeline, we pile in with broken-heart emojis and prayers for the families, a kind of wan language of loss. And when a death is as tragic as Flack’s, we stand even further on careful tippy-toes, offering soft-pedalled wishes that she had felt less alone, or footnoting our praise with terms like “she had her demons”. We remind our followers that there’s always someone to reach out to, even if we privately have often believed there is not. In our efforts to avoid saying the wrong thing, we resort to vagaries. I’m not suggesting I know of a better way.But I do know of a better way to treat the living. And I am – with both gratitude and some bitter aftertaste – able to describe the inner state of a person who has placed their self-image in the hands of the public a public that has made a sport of building up, then tearing down, the people we elect to entertain us. The deepest rage is reserved for women.There are a few caveats to apply here: I do not claim to know what Caroline Flack felt when she took her own life. I know that obsessively following her holiday outfits and “love rivals” does not make me an authority on her inner life, which was as rich, varied and insular as anyone’s. I also do not claim to know why some people take their lives when their circumstances nosee, and others do not.What I can say, with the authority of someone who has been on a decade-long journey through the funhouse of public life, is that none of us benefit from a culture in which young women are told that being revered by people who do not really know them, in any forum from secondary school to the X Factor stage, is the answer to ancient feelings of low self-worth, or a salve for the pain and powerlessness that accompany so many forms of female identity. When we tell our daughters, both through what we value and what we imitate, that their truth lies in what others reflect back at them, we set a standard that no amount of self-love Instagram quotes can undo. And so young women continue to chase the holy trifecta of beauty, productivity and likability, hoping that hitting their marks and saying their lines will lift from their backs the load they have carried since birth. To quote Kate Bush: “Oh, darling, make it go away.”It is in this quest for their own culturally specific version of perfection and adulation that nearly every woman I’ve met, no matter their differences, is united. The equally evil twin of these desires is to simply coast and camouflage. To be adored for qualities that are not really yours is very close to disappearing. Caroline Flack was adored and attacked for many of the same reasons: her brassiness, her autonomy when it came to personal decision-making, a sense of fight that kept her from taking criticism lying down. At the same time, she spoke (in an unpublished Instagram post shared by her family) of having repressed the stresses of trying to go along to get along: “I’ve accepted shame and toxic opinions on my life for over 10 years and yet told myself it’s all part of my job. No complaining. The problem with brushing things under the carpet is... they are still there and one day someone is going to lift that carpet up and all you are going to feel is shame and embarrassment.”History’s habit of erecting monuments to women, and then dismantling them just as quickly, is well known to us: from Cleopatra to Hillary Clinton, Queen Esther to Whitney Houston. I used to think women got it worse if they didn’t conform to the current standard of beauty, but being pretty is no picnic, either. (It seems we must always destroy our fantasy women no wonder Farrah Fawcett took a side turn into the art world later in life, where at least some fun and identity play are permitted.) Any woman engaged in public life is used to a kind of constant temperature check, trying to gauge whether or not there is blood in the water around them that day – but then again, so are women in abusive relationships, or girls at dog-eat-dog middle schools. As is often the case, female celebrities represent a sort of canary in the coal mine for wider attitudes towards women.Since Flack’s death, there has been a lot of finger-pointing, as well as meta-discussions about the impact of both social and tabloid media on mental health. One of her final Instagram posts has been much quoted: “In a world where you can be absolutely anything, be kind.” And, of course, kindness is a worthy, and necessary, goal. But I would ask that we also consider our ability to accept contradiction, complexity and grey areas in the women we idolise, and consider the violence of suspending them in mid-air above us and then cutting the harness. Our ability to forgive men in power, to celebrate their contradictory aspects, is well-documented. But the people who have lately been speaking to Flack’s inner beauty, work ethic and vivaciously engaging presence were mostly too afraid to do so in the weeks after her arrest in December. Their willingness to say, “A woman I admire may have done something that I don’t,” could have gone a long way to lessen her shame and expand her sense of possibility.I am not dismissing the seriousness of the charges against her. But nor do I want my own attempts to stay on the right side of people’s opinion to prevent me from saying what I really mean – which is that public vilification, especially as it follows public celebration, is almost too painful to bear for most, and a trauma like any other.I know what it feels like to be adored – to be hailed as refreshing, delightful, necessary, approachably stylish and fun. I also know what it feels like to be cast out and away, for some valid reasons and other arbitrary ones or, more accurately, for valid reasons that then make the arbitrary ones seem pretty damn good, too. I know what it feels like to be so dependent on an influx of praise that the loss of it feels like the removal of a vital organ. I know what it feels like to fully believe the hatred that is being directed at you by strangers, and to stop believing the people who love you when they tell you there is more to your story. I know what it feels like to be sure you’ve failed your family, and to be isolated from them because you cannot forgive yourself that failure.It was a long and lonely process, searching for another set of metrics by which to measure my own worth, to see myself as a human orced from the echo chamber of fickle fandom and female perfection. It didn’t change until I started asking myself: was I kind today? Was I honest? Did I do my best to be accountable to the people I love, and when I was wrong did I promptly admit it? These are the truths about a person that cannot be determined by a Reddit thread or a Sun article. And these are the units of measurement we so often forget to remind our daughters of – not because we have bad values, but because we have inherited a culture that does not believe in our essential right to be as messy and confounding as the men it celebrates. For me, getting to this place involved a combination of factors, an enormous amount of therapy and personal reflection, and, most of all, time. Time I wish Caroline had. There is no simple way to explain why she doesn’t.I imagine – with the stress on imagine – that Flack was reeling from several kinds of heartbreak, not least that which comes from being cast out of the golden circle of validation that celebrity has come to imply. I wish I could have told her that it changes. That it may not go back to the way it was, to life before you received death threats. Or dissections of your appearance by people who refuse to reveal their own. Or wittily constructed puns about what a total waste of lungs and a heart you are. But it can, with the right support and reconstruction, become something better – more self-reliant and therefore more peaceful, no matter how the boat may rock. I wish I could have told her all of this, but I also wish we could have shown her a more hopeful reality: that women who err and fail are just as worthy of love as the men who do the same.To honour her complexity, to name and celebrate it, will go a long way toward changing the narrative for the women who watched her. After all, she was an example. She still is.• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

This being the Donald Trump administration, however, where qualifications and expertise are often seen as prohibitive factors for top jobs, that’s exactly who we’ve been given.Cutting to the heart of the matter with her characteristic bluntness, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez this week pointed out the absurdity of placing Pence in charge of a potentially looming health crisis.“Mike Pence literally does not believe in science,” she tweeted on Wednesday. “It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. This decision could cost people their lives. Pence’s past decisions already have,” she said.Ocasio-Cortez reminded people of Pence’s credentials for the job. While he was governor of Indiana, he oversaw an HIV crisis that was so severe that at its peak, 20 new cases of HIV were diagnosed every week.“As governor, Pence’s science denial contributed to one of the worst HIV outbreaks in Indiana’s history,” she continued. “He is not a medical doctor. He is not a health expert. He is not qualified nor positioned in any way to protect our public health.”Rushing to the defense of the administration the next day, Ted Cruz jumped into the fray.“As you are speaking as the oracle of science, tell us, what exactly is a Y chromosome?” Cruz responded on Twitter. “And at what age of gestation does science tell us that an unborn child feels physical pain?”He may have picked the wrong opponent – Ocasio-Cortez, it transpires, holds an award for microbiology from MIT.Despite reports in the past of the two lawmakers, surprisingly, finding common ground on other issues, Ocasio-Cortez did not let the slight go unaddressed this morning. Touting her scientific background bona fides, and jabbing at Cruz, who, like Pence, gives primacy to his religious beliefs over science, she delivered an acerbic put-down.“I’m surprised you’re asking about chromosomes given that you don’t believe in evolution,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c92bd2584465722667c6f0071aa9b18002720e0/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8f100c9a630e6e618d23bcc5d68f3ca","title":"bernie sanders virginia super tuesday mike bloomberg","story":"In 2016, Sanders lost to Hillary Clinton in the state. But after a string of Democratic successes, things could be differentOn a crisp weekday afternoon before the Virginia primary on Super Tuesday, thousands of people turned out to see the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speak in the state’s capital, Richmond.Four years ago, Democratic voters in the commonwealth delivered a resounding rebuke of the Vermont senator’s promise for political revolution. But there are signs that this year might be different.After strong showings in the early primary voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Sanders stood before an adoring crowdat the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center, a shock of white hair against a sea of blue placards bearing his name, as the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Interest in the rally was so overwhelming that the campaign relocated to a larger venue.“That is getting the establishment very, very nervous,” he said, gleefully conjuring images of a cabal of Democrats desperately searching for a way to slow his march. “They’re staying up day and night trying to figure out how to stop us. And when they see turnout like this, they get even more nervous.”Sanders wasn’t exaggerating. That morning, the New York Times published a report based on interviews with dozens of Democratic Party officials who said they would attempt to block his nomination at the party’s convention in July if Sanders arrived with the most delegates but fell short of a majority needed to win the nomination outright.It’s the day when the greatest number of US states cast their votes to nominate presidential candidates, who will eventually compete for the White House in November’s general election.It is the biggest day in the US election calendar apart from election day itself. The candidates have each held hundreds of meet-and-greet events, travelled thousands of miles, eaten\u0026nbspa lot of junk food, and their campaigns have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get them to this make-or-break moment.In 2020, Super Tuesday falls on 3 March. Both\u0026nbspDemocrats and Republicans\u0026nbspwill be voting, but because Donald Trump does not face any serious challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.The early voting states – Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina – have all had their say over the past month, with Bernie Sanders emerging as the possible national frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination.But now, 14 states across the country – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia – as well as one US territory (American Samoa) and Democrats abroad will cast their votes on the same day.With so much uncertainty around the mechanics – and the mathematics – of the nomination process, Sanders is dedicating precious time to competing for Virginia’s 99 delegates before Tuesday’s slate of primary contests, when 16 states and US territories will have their say on which of the eight major remaining candidates should take on Donald Trump in the November election.On Saturday, as South Carolina holds its primary, Sanders will return for events in northern Virginia, where he will appear with the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and Virginia Beach.Powered by moderate, suburban voters, Virginia has become increasingly Democratic since the election of Trump. In 2017, Virginia elected a Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, in the first major test of the depth of antipathy to Trump in suburban America. In 2018, Virginia Democrats flipped three congressional seats critical to the party’s takeover of the US House. And in 2019, Democrats gained control of both chambers of the state legislature for the first time in a generation.A tradition-bound, business-friendly southern state isn’t an obvious fit for a democratic socialist senator from Vermont. In the 2017 Democratic gubernatorial primary, Northam handily beat the former congressman Tom Perriello, who ran as a progressive with Sanders’s endorsement.But a Monmouth University poll from last week showed Sanders neck-and-neck with Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who will appear on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday after foregoing the early-state contests. Virginia is a top target for Bloomberg, who launched his campaign in Norfolk and has blanketed the state with millions of dollars worth of political advertisements.“Mike Bloomberg has visited Virginia more than any other Super Tuesday state because of the importance our Commonwealth has in our overall strategy,” said Melissa Gallahan, Bloomberg’s 2020 Virginia state director. “With more than 80 staffers on the ground, seven offices open across the Commonwealth, and an unmatched field program, our campaign has been putting in the work to reach out to every voter in Virginia.”“In some ways you could say Virginia is a battle for the soul of the Democratic party,” said Bill Neidhardt, Sanders’s Virginia state director, who previously served as the campaign’s deputy state director in Iowa.“Bloomberg is trying to buy this election by basically flooding the state with as much money as possible,” he said. “But we’ve had hundreds, if not thousands, of volunteers who have been organizing here relentlessly for months … These two distinct models are about as far apart as it can get in the Democratic party. Which one can win here?”But the race is not a neat showdown between Sanders and Bloomberg. The former vice-president Joe Biden is also a major force in the state. On Friday, he was endorsed by the Virginia senator Tim Kaine and he will hold a rally in Norfolk on Sunday. A new poll on Friday showed Biden regaining momentum as Sanders slipped to second, underscoring the uncertainty of the primary.The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and US territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee.The goal for the candidates is to amass a majority of pledged delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate at the party’s convention. In all states, delegates are awarded proportionally among top vote-winners.To become the Democratic presidential nominee on the first ballot, the candidate must secure 1,991 pledged delegates.California has the most pledged delegates (494) followed by Texas (261), North Carolina (72) and Virginia (65).The Super Tuesday states also represent a much broader sweep of the US population, not just in terms of geography, but demographics too, than the early voting states. The results will therefore give a more detailed picture of who supports the candidates, and what their chances of winning on a national level may be.This small slice of the Democratic electorate will be decisive in determining not only if the party carries Virginia in November but if congresswomen like Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger, who flipped Republican-held seats in 2018, are re-elected in November, said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.“Democrats cannot assume anything about Virginia,” Sabato cautioned, adding: “The candidate matters.”Already, Republican groups are targeting the once deeply conservative Virginia districts held by Luria, Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton in an effort to tie the freshman Democrats to Sanders and other leftwing members of the party such as the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Luria endorsed Biden last month, along with other freshman moderates who have raised concerns about the down-ballot risk of nominating Sanders. In a statement, she said the former vice-president would “defeat Donald Trump and win in tough districts like mine”.More Virginia Democrats are likely to take sides in the final days before the primary. But, as has happened in other contests, the establishment is fractured among the many moderates still in the race, leaving an opening for Sanders to do well in a state that should be fertile ground for his rivals.In Virginia, voters of either party can cast ballots in the primary and there are indications that there could be more Republicans who participate this year than in 2016. Sanders, an independent senator, and Bloomberg, who was elected mayor of New York as a Republican and an independent, both see an opportunity to appeal to a crossover of disaffected voters.The Sanders campaign is targeting the state’s growing immigrant communities, with an emphasis on turning out Muslim and Hiic voters. They are also hoping to tap into the populist, anti-establishment streak that runs through the Appalachian corner of the state.There are currently\u0026nbspeight leading Democratic presidential candidates: former vice president Joe Biden, senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, former mayors Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg, billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer and Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.Sanders and Warren are on the progressive side of the party, while candidates like Biden, Klobuchar, Bloomberg and Buttigieg are regarded as more moderate.Super Tuesday will be the first time that Bloomberg will be on the ballot, and will be a key test of whether the hundreds of millions of dollars he has invested in his own campaign have paid off.\u0026nbspHe controversially skipped\u0026nbspthe first early voting states to concentrate on winning support in larger, delegate heavy states.Bloomberg has the largest staff in the state with seven offices and 80 members of staff on the ground. In visits, Bloomberg has presented himself to Virginia as a political pragmatist whose prolific spending on candidates in 2018 and 2019 played a role in Democratic victories across the state. Virginia unlocks only a fraction of the more than 1,300 pledged delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. But in the rare event that no candidate wins the nomination outright, every delegate could matter.The Virginia delegate Lee Carter, a former marine who defeated the Republican House majority whip to win his seat in 2017 and identifies as a Democratic socialist, believes Sanders has every reason to be optimistic about his standing in the state.“If people have the choice between a halfway Republican and a whole Republican, they’re going to pick the whole Republican,” Carter said, as the rally emptied on Thursday. “But if you give them the choice between a Republican who is unabashedly fighting for corporate interests and a Democrat like Bernie Sanders who is unabashedly fighting for the people’s interest, the people are going to show up to vote.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41343817522d9d4c16f49597b3cc1c3dbd94a0f5/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38c747c32397b7492ac7974edf94bbc2","title":"joe biden south carolina primary","story":"The former vice-president looks to be in the driver’s seat as the first state in the deep south casts its voteJoe Biden is heading into South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary vote on Saturday as the heavy favourite to win, which would provide a much-needed boost just days ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday elections.There was a point in the last few weeks when it seemed like the former vice-president’s South Carolina “firewall” might actually have some cracks in it. It seemed that the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Biden’s ideological polar opposite, might prevent him from winning the state decisively.That moment came and went.“I’ve been confident about South Carolina because I’ve worked so hard over 30 or more years here … not to run for president, but to have the relationship with the community,” Biden told CNN on Friday morning. “I believe it’ll be the launching pad for me.”Biden has campaigned on a message of dignity and unity, and stressed his experience as Barack Obama’s vice-president. He was the envy of other 2020 Democratic candidates this week, after he was endorsed by Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress.“Since Congressman Clyburn has endorsed the vice-president that has given him a great boost, a great energy. That has certainly provided clarity to iniduals that were undecided,” said Clay Middleton, a South Carolina Democratic national committee member.A day later, a new Monmouth University poll of South Carolina voters found Biden leading over Sanders by 20 percentage points. That poll was notably different from other recent South Carolina polls which showed Biden leading by single digits.A solid win would give his campaign a shot in the arm days ahead of the Super Tuesday elections, when Democratic voters in 16 states and US territories will have their say on which presidential candidate they want to see take on Donald Trump in the November election.Eight major Democratic candidates including Biden and Sanders remain in contention, and this week could mark a decisive make-or-break moment for several of them.Biden entered the presidential race as the frontrunner and heavy favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but has since struggled to meet expectations. He placed a distant fourth in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, the first vote in the race in February. He didn’t do much better in New Hampshire.Biden, a more moderate Democrat called out the progressive candidate directly at a campaign stop in McClellanville on Thursday, warning that Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal “will be a long, long expensive slog, cost over $35tn and the patients can’t afford to wait”.Sanders’ signature policy Medicare for All, which would implement a government-run healthcare system in the US, is one of the most contentious policies being debated among Democrats this year, highlighting splits between progressives and moderates who largely favor an expansion of Obamacare.Biden and his team have long argued that a win in South Carolina would rebuff his critics, and show he has the ability to attract a broad coalition of Democratic voters.“The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties,” Biden said during the latest Democratic  debate in Charleston. “I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African American vote here in South Carolina.”Mike McCauley, a veteran Democratic strategist based in South Carolina, said winning South Carolina could help Biden frame himself as the most prominent alternative to Sanders.“For moderate Democrats like myself and my colleagues and peers across South Carolina we’re looking for who’s going to be the alternative to Bernie that’s going to emerge,” he said. “So I think that’s the springboard that South Carolina can give Biden is to provide that distance.”While Sanders has risen to national frontrunner and become the candidate to beat, in South Carolina, where Biden leads in polling, the billionaire Democratic candidate Tom Steyer has also been a source of concern for the former vice-president.Steyer has poured $20m into his campaign in the state and made a concerted effort to win African American voters. He has made a point of highlighting his positions on reparations and racial justice as he has campaigned throughout the state.At a stop at a community resource center of North Charleston, Steyer said: “I really care about racial justice.”“I think when I come to South Carolina and talk to African Americans they realize I’m not kidding,” Steyer told the . “I’m serious about it and I think as a result we share some goals and we share some history and I’m talking about things that they can believe in, because I’m serious about it.”There is still a long way to go in the Democratic primary race before a presidential nominee is officially named at the party’s national convention in July.

But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/687dff3bb6f20dbae4f32f04717b9fb44d9fa0b1/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc86b2109fff0bae34075482bc31f72","title":"hand sanitiser or hand washing which more effective against coronavirus covid 19","story":"Supermarkets are running out of hand sanitiser as people rush to protect themselves from Covid-19. But does it beat using soap and water?As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitiser gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?The popularity of hand gels has not just been driven by the fear of pandemics. Lucrative opportunities to market them have pushed sales: they now come in pretty, child-friendly colours (bubblegum pink, bright blue) and with wellness-friendly scents (cinnamon, lavender) that are a far cry from the pungent-smelling version found in hospitals.Sanitisers have also evolved to include other active ingredients in place of alcohol, and there are recipes online for making your own. Good Housekeeping suggests vodka. Wellness bloggers plump for things such as witch-hazel and aloe vera. But are these effective in killing germs?Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that viruses are much more resistant to disinfectants than bacteria. Luckily, she says, coronavirus is an envelope virus, meaning it has a coating around it which the alcohol can attack, thereby eliminating the threat. (Norovirus and rhinovirus, by contrast, do not).This means that making your own sanitiser, while potentially effective against some bacteria, is not something Bloomfield would recommend. “It’s very unwise, dangerous, even,” she says. Shop-bought products also contain emollients to make them softer on the skin, without which you run the risk of hurting your hands. Getting the mix right at home would very tricky – so it is a big no-no.The key thing is when to use hand sanitiser. Covid-19 is a new illness, so no one knows exactly how it spreads. According to the NHS, it is likely that it is through cough droplets spread from person to person and very unlikely that it is transmitted through objects, be that packages or food.Bloomfield’s advice is to wash your hands with soap and water – or, if that is not possible, use hand gel – when you return to your “safe place”, by which she means your home, your desk or work station, or your seat on the train or plane, for example. Avoid touching anything you don’t need to touch, and be mindful of what you do touch – such as door handles and bus poles – and if you can’t wash your hands or use gel after coming into contact with things, do not touch your face.A virus needs a host – living cells – to reproduce: so don’t rub your eyes, or touch your mouth or any wounds if your hands are not clean. Keep your hands clear until you have access to gel or can wash them.The best option is soap and water. According to a 2019 study by the American Society for Microbiology, using running water and soap to wash your hands is more effective than a dab of gel that you have not quite rubbed in.Soap has mild antibacterial properties, but it does not kill viruses. It does remove dirt, though, so wet your hands with water, lather them up properly, on both sides, in between the fingers and under the nails, one hand and then the other. Rinse them thoroughly under running water for 20 seconds (or as the NHS puts it, the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday). Rinsing thoroughly is key to washing away any viruses. Dry your hands well with a disposable towel, then use that towel to turn off the tap before throwing it away.It might seem counterintuitive, but a study published in the medical journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings in 2012 concluded that, from a hygiene standpoint: “Paper towels are superior to air dryers.” This is because the towels dry your hands more quickly and more thoroughly than dryers do, and contamination happens more through wet hands than dry.Lisa Ackerley, a chartered environmental health practitioner, says that stocks of hand sanitiser running low is a problem, but cautions against panic-buying. First, you don’t need to use very much – a little bottle will go a long way. In fact, a spokesman for the chemical products company Kao Corporation reportedly said last week that too much hand gel can cause irritation and skin sensitivity, by drying out the skin and removing natural oils. Damaged skin increases vulnerability to infection, so hand sanitisers, like most things, are best used in moderation – and only when handwashing is not an option.As Bloomfield puts it, it is not about being paranoid. She likens the process to vaccinations or wearing seatbelts: it is about being disciplined. While some companies have reportedly banned handshaking and other physical contact in an effort to avoid Covid-19, that is not official guidance.It is impossible not to engage with the world, so you just need to be cautious and methodical in your hand hygiene. “If everyone complies with good hygiene,” says Bloomfield, “then you’re making sure as far as possible that you’re not picking it up, and in the unlikely event you are infected you’re not spreading it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469102ce7319d4cefd798fafe7117d13a1f8e653/0_128_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22618be1e59ab6f5ea3930c7cce96bed","title":"health groups step up uk coronavirus plans to reassure vulnerable","story":"Several organisations have seen an increase in calls for advice from anxious peopleOrganisations representing people vulnerable to coronavirus are stepping up preparations for a UK outbreak, in a bid to allay growing fears among those with underlying health conditions.According to the World Health Organization, older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to the virus.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 20 Februrary, China has recorded 2,118 deaths\u0026nbspfrom the Covid-19 outbreak.\u0026nbspHealth officials have confirmed\u0026nbsp74,576 cases\u0026nbspin mainland\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspin total. More than 12,000 have recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least 28 other countries. Japan has 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and has recorded one death. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France and the Philippines.There have been nine recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. As of 17 February, a total of 4,501 people have been tested in the UK, of which 4,492 were confirmed negative.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.But people with respiratory conditions and compromised immune systems have described facing crippling anxiety about what could happen to them should an outbreak of coronavirus hit the UK.Georgie Wishart, a 30-year-old charity worker with ankylosing spondylitis, a condition which requires her to take immunosuppressants, described the daily battle to deal with her anxiety.“When it first came into the news, I was on the verge of having anxiety attacks because I didn’t know how I was going to cope,” she said. “There was genuinely a part of me thinking this is how I might die.“I keep reminding myself of the facts: there aren’t that many confirmed cases, precautions are being taken, and that if it becomes a problem I will deal with it. Because if I didn’t say that to myself every day, it would be really difficult to leave the house.”A 37-year-old business owner from Brighton, which has seen the highest concentration of UK cases, explained that his family decided to self-isolate to protect his asthmatic daughter.“We are just checking news websites all the time,” he said. “We have spoken over the phone with our GP, but he was a young guy that just read out the general Public Health England guidelines.”He home-schooled his daughters for two weeks before sending them back to school after finding more statistics regarding children. Current evidence suggests that children do not appear to be vulnerable, with few cases of children testing positive for the virus.Several organisations representing people with underlying health conditions said they have seen an increase in calls for advice.Asthma UK has set up a crisis management group to track the progress of the virus. Calls to the charity are increasing daily, said Emma Rubach, head of health advice at Asthma UK.“We know that the risk to people with asthma from viruses like coronavirus is higher than the general population, so we are encouraging people to make sure their asthma is well-managed,” she said.Anxiety is high among other patient groups, such as people with cystic fibrosis, which can result in respiratory complications. Kevin Southern, a consultant paediatrician and cystic fibrosis specialist said: “It is very difficult to be reassuring at the moment, as it is unknown territory, but we are telling our families to follow the official advice, to be prepared, have extra antibiotics in the house and contact their teams with any concerns.” Advice from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust states that there is currently no need for people with cystic fibrosis to limit their activities.Susan Walsh from the PID UK said they were advising people to follow PHE guidelines. “We are also telling people that if they do feel ill they should contact a doctor promptly with details of their diagnosis, medication and immunology centre,” she said. “It’s a balance between raising awareness, but not creating great fear. It needs to be handled very carefully.”Derek Nott, director of support line services at Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was understandable that people with cancer “may be feeling more anxious” and said anyone concerned that they may have been in contact with someone with coronavirus, should follow advice from Public Health England, and call 111. He added that people needing clinical, practical and financial information should call the Macmillan support line on 0800 808 0000.Several people the  spoke to said they were struggling to cope with the psychological weight of worrying about coronavirus. One 28-year-old PR consultant whose mother has late-stage ovarian cancer, said she had never “felt so totally out of control”.“Cancer robs people of a lot of choices and it feels like coronavirus is limiting me and my family even more,” she said. “I am desperate for someone to say something comforting. I yearn for an expert on coronavirus or cancer to tell us it’ll all be ok.”The Mental Health Foundation, which has advice for people with coronavirus-related anxiety and stress, said the uncertainty around coronavirus could breed fear. “The huge volume of news, fake news and comment about the virus can also leave people stressed out and afraid of what’s ahead,” said a spokesperson. The foundation suggests getting information from reliable sources, following hygiene advice, using stress management techniques and limiting news consumption.All the charities and iniduals the  spoke to called for members of the public to be aware that their hygiene habits were not only key to their own health and that of their families, but to vulnerable people throughout the country.“I am much more aware of the risk of catching infection and I am very diligent with my own hygiene but you really notice how other people just aren’t,” said Wishart, who travels into central London daily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965f1a83746f3fabd33b5ef5d23fa427cb02271a/19_0_3269_1961/master/3269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be652141e7cdfe253f322d813ce3cc9a","title":"nato turkey syria airstrikes russia un jens stoltenberg","story":"Military alliance could strengthen reconnaissance missions to limit threat from Russian planesNato allies will consider strengthening Ankara’s air defences in response to the strike that killed 33 Turkish troops in rebel-held Syria overnight, following an emergency meeting of the military alliance in Brussels on Friday.Turkey had also called for western countries to establish a no-fly zone after the incident but Nato sources stressed that idea – which could lead to direct conflict with the Russian air force – was not seriously discussed.Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, said that members of the western military alliance expressed their “full solidarity” with Turkey in the aftermath of the attack, which took place in the last rebel-held province of Idlib.But Stoltenberg offered no immediate promise of assistance to Turkey, saying instead in the aftermath of the meeting that Nato members were “constantly looking into what more they can do to provide further support for Turkey”.Sources said this would most likely mean strengthening Nato’s existing reconnaissance mission over the country and building on the Patriot air defence system run by Spain. Although the US has previously said it would only supply similar equipment directly if Turkey ditches plans to deploy a rival Russian S-400 system.Nato had held urgent talks on the crisis on Friday after Turkey requested a rare emergency meeting of members under article 4 of the alliance’s governing treaty, on the grounds that its security was under threat.Turkish officials blamed Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian regime for the major attack on its troops and launched retaliatory attacks, saying it had destroyed five Syrian military helicopters and two air defence systems, and “neutralised” 309 Syrian regime soldiers, without providing evidence. A war monitor said at least 20 Syrian troops had died in the counterattacks.However, several sources in Idlib and unverified footage of the night-time strike suggested it had been carried out by the Russian air force, which has helped Damascus conduct a ferocious three-month offensive in the province.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s communications director, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey had retaliated by hitting Damascus regime targets “from the air and ground”. Drone footage released by the Turkish military of the response showed blistering attacks on tanks, howitzers and soldiers.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo described Thursday’s attack as “despicable and brazen” and said the US was “reviewing options to assist Turkey against this aggression as we seek to prevent further Assad regime and Russian brutality and alleviate the humanitarian suffering in Idlib.”One Turkish soldier was killed and another wounded in a fresh artillery fire by the Syrian regime on Friday.Dominic Raab, the UK’s foreign secretary, led calls to hold an emergency UN security council session in New York on Friday evening, supported by the US, France, Germany, Estonia, the Dominican Republic and Belgium, which holds the security council presidency.Raab said: “Yesterday’s events only confirmed the reckless and brutal nature of the offensive which the Syrian regime and Russia are conducting in Idlib. This has created the gravest humanitarian crisis of the entire war.”No formal resolution is expected following the meeting, but diplomats said the key discussion points would be the attribution of the strike and whether any security council member would say it was carried out by a Russian plane.Turkey said Erdoğan had discussed the crisis with the US president, Donald Trump, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Friday. The chancellor’s spokesman said she “condemned the ruthless attacks on Turkish troops”.Almost a million people have been displaced and driven north to the Turkish border by the regime campaign on rebels and jihadist factions, making the battle for control of Syria’s last opposition stronghold the worst humanitarian crisis in the war to date.The deadly bombardment has added to weeks of growing tensions between Turkey, a supporter of Syrian rebels and a Nato member, and Moscow, which is allied with Assad.Adding to the volatile situation, Moscow sent two warships, the Admiral Makarov and Admiral Grigorovich, both capable of firing Kalibr cruise missiles, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean waters off Syria on Friday. They moved through the Bosphorus strait, which is governed by an international treaty, sailing through the heart of Istanbul.In a telephone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Erdoğan said Syrian government troops and allied forces remained legitimate targets for Ankara. The Kremlin said it agreed on the need for a new arrangement to avert clashes in Idlib. Turkey said the leaders agreed to meet as soon as possible.There was no immediate confirmation from Damascus of the reported troop deaths or any comment on the flare-up with Ankara.The UN said the latest fighting was coming “dangerously close” to encampments of the displaced, risking an imminent “bloodbath”.Turkey, which is already home to millions of Syrian refugees, fears more people will attempt to cross its closed southern border as the Assad regime tries to recapture Idlib, the last significant rebel-held province in the north-west of the country, with the help of Russian airstrikes.Thursday’s attack brought to 53 the number of Turkish security personnel killed in Idlib this month. Elsewhere on Thursday, jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government’s devastating offensive.The counter-offensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c999fce77c3a90b7915bdc0c9905f89c4524fca/591_429_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebefba2ed86c19f96c881ab216c92b0e","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms wuhan china pandemic spread covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

This is where we stand so far this morning:Ferrari will seek assurances from Australian authorities that its staff will be allowed to travel and not face quarantine restrictions before heading to Melbourne for the Australian Grand Prix, which opens the Formula One season on 15 March.The Italian giant suspended non-critical business travel and external access to its factory in Maranello, about 200km from the centre of the Italian outbreak in Codongo, on Wednesday. The Victorian sports minister Martin Pakula told  on Thursday that the event would go ahead, and the Australian Grand Prix corporation said it would comply with advice from the government and health authorities. But without Ferrari, the F1 would lose its biggest drawcard.Ferarri team principle Mattia Binotto raised the issue after his staff faced difficulties getting to the Bahrain F2 test this weekend. He said he would need confirmation from F1 and FIA officials that there would be “no surprises” before allowing staff to travel to Australia.What we will need is simply to have assurance before leaving.If there are any medical screenings, we need to know about them. You need to know exactly what’s about. We need to understand what are the consequences in case of any problem?Obviously we need to protect our employees. We have got collective and inidual responsibility towards them. And it’s important, really, to make sure that before leaving, the picture, whatever is the scenario, is known and clear.Binotto said with Ferrari providing assistance to Haas and Alfa Sauber as well as their own AlphaTauri team, more than one team could be affected.What will be the situation that if eventually four teams cannot run and if the race will take place or not? That is not my decision.Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has warned party officials there would be “serious consequences” of failing to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus in that country.More from AFP: The impoverished nation, with a weak and ill-equipped healthcare system, has closed its borders to prevent the spread of the disease into its territory.Kim told a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea that the fight against the virus was a “crucial state affair for the defence of the people” that required maximum discipline, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).“In case the infectious disease spreading beyond control finds its way into our country, it will entail serious consequences,” KCNA quoted Kim as saying.Two senior officials - party vice-chairmen Ri Man Gon and Pak Thae Dok - were sacked, and a party unit disbanded for corruption, the report said, indicating that they may have been involved in graft linked with the anti-epidemic measures.“No special cases must be allowed,” he added, and ordered officials to “seal off all the channels and space through which the infectious disease may find its way”.Pyongyang has not reported a single case of COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,800 people and infected over 84,000 people in dozens of countries since it emerged in neighbouring China.North Korea has banned tourists, suspended international trains and flights and placed hundreds of foreigners in quarantine to prevent an outbreak. It has also reportedly postponed the new school term.With loudspeakers blaring hygiene messages, ambassadors locked in their compounds, and state media demanding “absolute obedience”, North Korea’s anti-coronavirus measures have been described as “unprecedented” by diplomats.South Korea, meanwhile, is battling a major outbreak of the virus with more than 2,300 cases - the highest number outside mainland China.Germany’s ambassador to the United Nations has said the Security Council would adopt humanitarian exemptions to the sanctions imposed on Pyongyang over its weapons programmes, and allow the export of equipment to help North Korea fight the coronavirus.But “the problem is that right now the North Koreans closed the borders,” Christoph Heusgen said Thursday after a closed-door Security Council meeting about the reclusive state.The members of the Security Council called on North Korea “to allow this equipment in. So the population can be protected,” he added, without elaborating on the type of equipment.The number of new cases reported in Mainland China is the lowest since the national health authority started compiling nationwide data last month, Reuters has reported.Excluding Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak originated in the country, there were just four new cases of infection reported on Friday. In Hubei itself, 423 new cases were reported, of which 420 were in Wuhan. So a total of 427 in mainland China.South Korea reported 571 new cases on Friday, taking its total — the highest in the world outside China — to 2,337, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.The US will postpone an ASEAN regional summit in Las Vegas to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has reported. US president Donald Trump invited members of the 10-member association to a meeting on 14 March after he did attend a summit in Bangkok in November. California has reported two cases of coronavirus in people who had not travelled internationally, or come into close contact with any other identified cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that officials were “aware of a second possible instance of community spread of Covid-19 in California”.The patient is an older woman with chronic health conditions in San Jose. She did not have a travel history or any known contact with an infected person. Ten of the 60 cases of the respiratory disease in the US are in California. Mainland China had 427 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on Friday, the country’s National Health Commission said on Saturday, up from 327 cases a day earlier.There were also 248 new suspected cases. That brings the total accumulated number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 79,251. The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 2,835 as of the end of Friday, up by 47 from the previous day. The central province of Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 45 new deaths, while in the provincial capital of Wuhan, 37 people died.We’re expecting an update on that new coronavirus case in Queensland at 12.30pm local time. In the mean time, you can read Melissa Davey’s explainer on whether Australians should be worried about coronavirus here.US president Donald Trump has accused the democrats of politicising the coronavirus, and said the US are “magnificently organised” and “totally ready” for the virus. Addressing a rally in South Carolina, Trump also accused the media — specifically CNN — of “hysteria” over the virus. This is from CNN reporter Daniel Dale.Trump then repeated his bit about South Korean film Parasite winning best picture at the Oscars (more on that here, if you’re interested) before returning to coronavirus:The AHPPC said that with the increased spread of the disease, extending travel bans was “not likely to be feasible or effective.” In the past few days, the numbers of cases of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy, and Iran have been rapidly increasing. The AHPPC said the situation in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore also remains a concern.Whilst case numbers in some of these countries are rising quickly, the prevalence of illness is currently orders of magnitude lower than in Hubei Province.An assessment of the risk of COVID-19 in those countries is based on many factors, including the identification of transmission chains, the number of reported deaths, recent trends in incidence, the incidence of exported cases and modelled estimates of expected numbers of cases based on travel patterns. The ability of countries to respond effectively to infectious disease outbreaks is also an important consideration, along with the feasibility of stringent mobility restrictions given the current phase of the epidemic globally.With this change in epidemiology, extending travel bans to restrict travel from multiple countries is not likely to be feasible or effective in the medium term. However, it may be appropriate to consider self-isolation or practise social distancing upon return from higher risk regions.On Friday the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) issued a statement about the effectiveness of quarantine measures. The only new COVID-19 detections in Australia in the last two weeks are eight cases in Australian passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.There remains no evidence of community transmission in Australia, with thousands of negative tests for COVID-19 in the last week alone. The risk to the Australian community from travellers from mainland China appears to have reduced significantly since the inception of travel restrictions. This could justify some further easing of travel restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13a637279cb992523257552ed6041a4ce251b49/0_110_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18d4fe93cc6f222ae711c0fec08adea2","title":"coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update","story":"US strengthens travel advice, raising Iran and Italy to a level three, advising people to ‘avoid nonessential travel’.

According to the broadcaster, the Vietnamese government has also detected no new cases of coronavirus for the past 15 days. For the past 15 days, including on Friday, the government also detected no new cases of infections, the last one having been reported on February 13. “If fighting COVID-19 has been a war, then we have won the first round but not the entire war because the situation can be very unpredictable,” Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam was quoted as saying.

An ex-pat teacher in Vietnam tells the : Hanoi have also announced another week off school for all levels until the 8th.Many expat teachers have been out of work now for a month with many returning to their home country whilst the others stick it out.The health minister, Edward Argar, has said that the UK continues to be in a “containment phase” of coronavirus spread, and said cancelling events would not be considered unless the outbreak worsened. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: We’re still in the containment phase of this disease. We have been pretty good at containing it thus far. And the chief medical officer has been very clear that there is no reason to think that we shouldn’t be able to continue containing it, so that’s what our focus is on.Chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has spoken publicly about the possibility of ramping up measures to protect the public. But Agar said there was no reason to curtail mass events. Similarly, with school closures. He’s been clear there is no reason or need for schools en masse to close. If there are particular incidents, Public Health England and local teams will give advice. So what Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, has been saying is, these are all things that, in responsible contingency planning for the future, we will be looking at. But we are clear that these are not needed at the moment and that we believe, as he said, that we will not need to move to that phase on the base of where we are at the moment.Argar refused to comment on reports that the first person to contract coronavirus in the UK also passed it on to their doctor.  has been told there are fears that a doctor from the patient’s surgery may also have been infected with the virus. If confirmed, this would prompt particular concern as the GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week.I’m aware of the  report, but I’m going on the basis of what I’ve been toldI haven’t had any details of that and I think it would be wrong to comment on speculation in the press without that detailed advice from the chief medical officer. I have not been briefed on anything beyond the detail that the chief medical officer and others have given me about this inidual case. It is a new development but the chief medical officer has also said we are still doing the contact tracing around that and we are still looking into the details of that case, so it is probably a bit premature to say more than that at the moment.South Korea has reported 219 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country’s total infections to 3,150, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Saturday, Reuters reports.  The new cases are in addition to the 594 confirmed earlier in the day. Together they logged a record daily increase in infections since South Korea confirmed its first patient on 20 January.Earlier (5.27am), we reported how South Korean authorities had asked residents to stay at home this weekend to help contain the spread of the coronavirus. Large swathes of Seoul and other cities appear to be largely deserted.Health officials in the US have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have been infected within the country, in a turning point in efforts to contain Covid-19 there, Reuters is reporting. Three new cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the US west coast. They  nearly 900 miles, from California’s Silicon Valley region to the Puget Sound near Seattle. The agency reported a U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statement on Friday citing three new diagnoses - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.  If confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed iniduals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with a person known to be infected.  The three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.  A fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.

You can read a wrap of these developments here.Some Australians have begun stockpiling food and medication in anticipation of a coronavirus outbreak.Gary Nunn reports that the threat of a pandemic, coming so soon after a horrific summer of bushfires that left many communities cut off for weeks, has made preppers out of people who would previously have laughed at the idea.One Sydney couple have already gathered three months worth of supplies.But experts say it is not necessary. Professor Nigel McMillan, the director of infectious diseases and immunology at the Menzies Health Institute at Griffith University in Queensland, says:There’s no need to stockpile food, medicine, petrol or anything at this stage.You can read the full piece here.Theme parks and sports stadiums in Japan have been closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The Australian government has issued a statement on the travel ban to Iran, saying it is “part of our ongoing strategy of containment and minimising risk to the Australian community as detailed in our pandemic preparedness plan.”As of 1 March 2020:In a joint statement, prime minister Scott Morrison, health minister Greg Hunt and foreign minister Marine Payne said the travel advice was lifted on the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee.  Australia’s Melbourne bureau chief, Melissa Davey, explained those reasons here.The United States has updated its travel advice for Iran and Italy, warning people to “avoid nonessential travel” due to the increased spread of coronavirus.It comes as Australia placed a travel ban on Iran, putting it on the same restrictions as China. “Avoid nonessential travel” is a level three warning. China and South Korea were already under the same warning.The ratings for Italy and Iran were updated by the CDC on Friday. The upgraded travel advice for Italy in particular is expected to have implications for businesses that have policies against allowing staff to travel to countries with a level three warning in place.There is no additional travel warning for Hong Kong, and Japan currently sits at a level two, which means travellers are advised to practice “enhanced precautions.”Health officials in the US are reportedly worried that the novel coronavirus is spreading through communities on the west coast, after three patients — one in Oregon, one in California and one in Washington — were infected through unknown means.This report from Associated Press.None of the patients had recently travelled overseas or had any known close contact with a traveller or an infected person, authorities said. Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area also reported two cases where the source of infection wasn’t known, AP reported. The new coronavirus cases of unknown origin marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines, though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low. California public health officials on Friday said more than 9,380 people are self-monitoring after arriving on commercial flights from China through Los Angeles and San Francisco. That’s up from the 8,400 that Gov. Gavin Newsom cited on Thursday, though officials said the number increases daily as more flights arrive. Officials are not too worried, for now, about casual contact, because federal officials think the coronavirus is spread only through “close contact, being within six feet of somebody for what they’re calling a prolonged period of time,” said Dr. James Watt, interim state epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health. The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. Cherry blossom festivals in Japan have been cancelled due to fears around the coronavirus.The traditional spring celebrations in Tokyo and Osaka, which attract millions of people wanting to seeing the white and pink flowers, will not go ahead as planned in April.“We are sincerely sorry for those who were looking forward to the viewing ... but please give us your understanding,” the Japan Mint in Osaka said Friday.Other cherry blossom events - feverishly anticipated by locals and tourists - are likely to follow suit, according to local media.Organisers of Tokyo’s Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival said people could still enjoy the blooming trees that grow along public roads.Trees in Tokyo will soon be in full bloom, with friends, families and colleagues typically flocking to parks for sometimes raucous, alcohol-fuelled celebrations.The cancellations come as authorities step up efforts to tackle the outbreak in Japan, which has reported more than 230 infections and five deaths.Schools are closed and the government is urging people to work from home or commute during off-peak hours and avoid large gatherings.The operator of Tokyo’s two Disney resorts - Disneyland and DisneySea - said Friday the parks would be closed for around two weeks due to the virus.Universal Studios Japan in Osaka has also shuttered for a fortnight.Tiger Ye, a 21-year-old student in Wuhan, contracted the novel coronavirus. He wrote about the experience in . By 26 January getting up had become extremely difficult and I was shivering with cold. I felt I was having a high fever, and I was: 39C. Reports later said that the situation could develop extremely fast in the middle stage, but before I knew it, by that evening the fever was gone. It felt like having been to hell and back. That period from 21 January to the 26th was the worst time. I coughed so bad my stomach was hurting and my back ached. Those were some of the worst days in my life.You can read the full story here:"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4178619.1582129804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bogged down bleak outlook for the west s blanket peatlands","story":"Looking out at blackface ewes caught in the squalls, tails to the wind, hailstones sequinned on their fleeces, it has been hard to grudge them their share of the western landscape. How fair would it be to call the high, bare slopes of the hills “sheepwrecked”?This was a coinage from George Monbiot, radical columnist on ecological issues for the  newspaper. It headed a chapter in Feral, his book that urged “rewilding” of the upland ecosystems.Monbiot lived until recently at Machynlleth in Wales, below Cambrian mountains “grazed to destruction” and the source of both the Severn and Wye rivers. After previous Welsh floods, he dared to put the blame on the hill sheep. His comments on Countryfile raised a storm.This came to mind as I watched, appalled, the latest flooding of western UK. Both these islands share “extreme events” of unconscionable rainfall. An avalanche of soil unfurling on one Welsh hillside was so like the one that still scars the mountain round the corner in Killary harbour, opposite Leenane. Other Irish landslides have been far more damaging, and the Geological Survey has even mapped more potential sites.It has been three decades since I had to describe the severe overgrazing of western hills caused by the EU’s headage subsidies on unsustainable peatland. A great deal has changed since then, in reduction of sheep numbers, environmental grant schemes and enlightened local initiatives.The fabric of the hills has been slow to repair, as Nardus and Molinia grasses hold their grasp. Whole communities of mosses and liverworts have gone. Heather creeps back on the drier ground. but rarely to the height or luxuriance that once soaked up the rain and sheltered coveys of red grouse. For that, one has to visit, say, the protected slopes of Connemara National Park. Profound changeA different but equally profound change is the current exodus from hill farming. The toll of ageing aside, this is blamed on falling incomes. A study for the Irish Uplands Forum has found these well below the average industrial wage and almost wholly composed of basic EU farm payments. The bulk of sheep, however, are still held on the western seaboard and on uplands in the south and east. More than 800,000 head are mountain ewes. As ageing farmers drop out, their land is often annexed into neighbouring “ranches”.A concern expressed by Teagasc researchers is that “vast tracts of commonage will become . . . completely abandoned” because their condition is seen as agriculturally worthless. Neither the EU nor Teagasc can bear the thought of uplands smothered ungrazably with unmanaged heather, gorse, willow scrub or trees – all vegetation that might be expected to hold back the rain.For many ecological enthusiasts, leaving “vast tracts” of Irish hills to nature, or restoring them with native trees, would be ideal. New woodlands of Scots pine, birch and sessile oak flourish in their dreams.Before the postglacial climate change, many centuries ago, brought its own relentless rains, Scots pine was the dominant tree of the uplands, but there’s no chance of its unaided regeneration. One man in Co Wicklow carries a bunch of pine seedlings on his hill walks and plants them where he can, protected inside little barricades of rocks.Enduring fantasySome of the growing legion of hillwalkers might, perhaps, be moved to read The Man Who Planted Trees, Jean Giono’s enduring fantasy, and carry a pocketful of sprouted acorns of the native sessile oak. Prodded deep into any likely crevice of mineral soil, who knows? Until, I fear, the first snip from a passing sheep. Meanwhile, treeless blanket peat has absorbent values of its own, soaking up both water and atmospheric carbon. In his book Feral, Monbiot was irked to find the EU opposing upland tree planting on the grounds that it would release too much carbon from the soil. One of many objectives in a new “Wild Atlantic Nature” project, backed by the EU Life programme, is “removal of encroaching trees and shrubs” from blanket peatland in protected areas along the Wild Atlantic Way. These, no doubt, would include rhododendron and the lodgepole pines self-sown from ageing Coillte forestry.“Restoring” the bogs in 24 SACs along the Wild Atlantic Way faces a pessimistic description from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and a lack of any national conservation plan for blanket bogs, even in protected areas.The project lists the causes of damage: “Centuries of peat cutting, reclamation, burning, drainage and invasive species. In more recent decades afforestation, over- or under-grazing, recreation and infrastructural developments . . . ”Add in “low levels of public appreciation” of how peatland matters to climate change, or why communities should feel a caring ownership for the local bog, and you might wonder where to start."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Collision occurred at about 2.15am in Dundalk and garda forensics are en routeOrganisation says governments need to wake up before disease spirals out of controlRed level wind warning in place for counties Galway and Clare on Saturday afternoonStatus red, the highest level warning, issued for Clare and Galway as winds batter countryThe most hated man in rural Ireland? \u0027It\u0027s wrong\u0027, says the defeated MinisterMark Condren named press photographer of the yearInidual speaker\u0026rsquos award goes to Rachael Mullally representing UCD LawDriver and passenger pronounced dead at scene of collision with jeep on Friday eveningMet \u0026Eacuteireann says people should \u0026ldquostop everything and stay indoors during red alertStudents nationwide carry out protests against proposed on-campus rental increasesSign of peace is to be suspended at Masses and holy water fonts emptiedBest-selling novelist appeals construction plan over \u0026lsquocatastrophic\u0026rsquo impact on privacyAnti-immigrant Facebook platform follows stream of similar pages in recent monthsKnives, hachetes and hatchets seized by police after disturbance appear new, court toldThe Tartan Spartan had been sent for slaughterFine Gael\u0026rsquos Kate O\u0026rsquoConnell and Michelle Mulherin not selected by party for electionJudge said defendant continued with work in blatant disregard of notifications to stop\u0026lsquoNo cover\u0026rsquo for cancelling trips other than to places cited by Department of Foreign AffairsStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4188256.1582923842!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord lofty leo and pals look back with misty eyes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: far from those good old days and the vacant seats on State boards which he  never got around to filling before calling the election.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPACongratulations to Fine Gael on achieving a perfect balance on the gender front.Their much awaited top-pick of 13 favoured ones to contest the Seanad elections emerged from headquarters on Thursday night, along with the groundbreaking news that the party had selected the same number of women candidates as candidates called John. Three of each. A stunning achievement.The members of the parliamentary party can claim no responsibility for bringing about this ceiling-shattering list. Instead, it was an inside job for what are known as the “inside” nominations.Leader Leo Varadkar, general secretary Tom Curran and the members of the National Executive can take full credit for cranking up the effort to future-proof and gender-proof the old party.When we say they can claim no responsibility, that’s not strictly true. TDs and Senators were given blank nomination forms at this week’s parliamentary party meeting. They had to sign them and hand them back. The National Executive then decided which candidates to select, filling in names on the pre-signed documents.Each candidate needs the backing of four Oireachtas members. On their current strength, this allows Fine Gael 13 runners. But the TDs and Senators have no say when it comes to whose name they will endorse. They could be signing the nomination papers for an axe-murderer, for all they know about it.The list is compiled very carefully, with an eye to winning future Dáil seats. Ten men and three women made the final cut. That sends out an interesting message.Stunning omissionAmong those overlooked was Dublin Bay South’s Kate O’Connell, a TD with a national profile and one of the stand-out performers from the last Dáil. She lost out to colleague Eoghan Murphy while taking 12 per cent of the vote.O’Connell, who may not always have toed the party line, is said to be “stunned” by her omission.The process of seeking an “outside” nomination from a vocational body is already closed. The “inside” Oireachtas nominations close on Monday but the Fine Gael list is done. It is telling that Regina Doherty, Mary Mitchell O’Conor and Marcella Corcoran-Kennedy, all of whom held ministerial office before they lost their seats, have chosen to walk away completely from national politics.Fine Gael’s lucky 13 will challenge for seats on the “inside” sub-panels, where all the nominees are chosen by TDs and outgoing Senators. The field is less crowded than the “outside” vocational section. The three women who made the grade are Cllr Emer Currie, Leo Varadkar’s running mate in Dublin West Cllr Aisling Dolan who contested Roscommon-Galway and Bettystown-based Cllr Sharon Tolan from the southernmost end of the Louth constituency. The 10 men are Cllr John Cummins (Waterford), Cllr John Paul O’Shea (Cork North West) and Cllr John MacGahon (Louth), all unsuccessful general election candidates outgoing TDs Tom Neville (Limerick), Michael D’arcy (Wexford) and Noel Rock (Dublin North West) outgoing Senators Joe O’Reilly (Cavan-Monaghan) and Jerry Buttimer (Cork South Central) Cllr Micheál Carrigy (Longford-Westmeath) and Cllr Garret Ahearn (Tipperary), also unsuccessful in the general election.Cherishing the ladiesThis time last year, the Cabinet met in special session to mark International Women’s Day. The Taoiseach and his Ministers (along with a huge song and dance) met in Pearse Street’s Academy Building, where the Irish Women’s Workers Union was founded in 1911 at a meeting addressed by Constance Markievicz. Oh, the symbolism. They were delighted with themselves. Ministers reviewed, among other things, the 2017 National Strategy for Women and Girls. Its aim is to encourage women into leadership roles in the workplace, sport, politics and the arts.One of the self-congratulatory press releases afterwards trumpeted the Cabinet’s decision to implement “a range of new measures to promote increased participation by women in the upcoming local elections and greater gender equality on local councils”. Whatever about the locals, enthusiasm waned by the time the general election came around. In order to qualify for State funding, at least 30 per cent of a party’s candidates must be women. Fine Gael just squeaked in with 30.5 per cent.Mind you, some of the others weren’t that hot either – Fianna Fáil managed 31 per cent, Labour 32 per cent and Sinn Féin 33 per cent. For all the snazzy publicity and talk of cherishing the ladies, it doesn’t look like Leo and the top brass learned very much from their big day out in Pearse Street. Still, there is always room for improvement. There’s always the party’s list for the Seanad. Going forward (or otherwise). Oh.\u0026nbspMontrose callingThere is fear and foreboding in media circles as aspirant editorial controllers in Sinn Féin gird their loins and prepare to take control of the airwaves. Senior management types in RTÉ are weeping quietly in corners.It’s all the Government’s fault. Once upon a time, outgoing administrations used to stuff State boards with failed candidates and drinking buddies and appoint cronies to judicial benches and every possible quango.Back in the mists of time (1977), then taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and tánaiste Brendan Corish were especially enthusiastic after their crushing defeat to Jack Lynch.The appointment of defeated TD Brendan Toal as a land commissioner caused particular consternation since Brendan had no obvious qualifications for the post. Liam’s successor, Garret FitzGerald, was mortified and declared himself agin this class of behaviour.But Cosgrave remained unrepentant, viewing such patronage, long-practised by Fianna Fáil, as fair game. Journalist turned broadcaster Ted Nealon was among those who defended Cosgrave, regarding the appointments as proof of his loyalty to those who had served the party well and had paid a price.Lofty Leo and his pals must be looking back with misty eyes on those good old days as they survey all the vacant seats on State boards which they never got around to filling before calling the election.Chief among them are berths on the RTÉ board where the terms of office of most of the members have expired, according to the national broadcaster’s website. Ditto for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, where a similar situation exists. There are so many expired terms of office it’s a wonder either of them can rustle up a quorum for a board meeting these days.Of course in these politically correct days, there is a system of public application for these positions, but the buck stops at the Cabinet table, especially with the Minister for Communications (Richard Bruton) in the case of RTÉ and the BAI.Board applicants are now interviewed by the Oireachtas committee on communications, and in the new political dispensation, the chair of the next one might not be a fan of the State broadcaster.Media biasSinn Féin has an obsession with media bias and a few utterances from that quarter since the party’s electoral breakthrough have set nerves jangling among the put-upon public service broadcasters.At the party’s post-election moral victory rally in Newry on Wednesday night, the contribution from one audience member caused the earth to move in Merrion Square (BAI) and Montrose, but not in a good way. A party supporter from Belfast said that when Sinn Féin get into government they should take the Department of Communications and have “a special word” with RTÉ over the “disgraceful way they deal with us in Northern Ireland”. This was greeted with applause from the floor.Mary Lou McDonald’s more measured response – “All of them have a job to do and we want them to do their job well” – will have had Montrose mandarins reaching for the Imodium. And this, on top of the fear induced by Ard Comhairle member and former councillor Enda Fanning, who tweeted immediately after the election about the need for a monitoring body to prevent media bias against Sinn Féin.Meanwhile, the Taoiseach’s department established a Commission on the Future of Public Service Broadcasting in December. DCU president Prof Brian MacCraith was appointed as its chairman in January. But the commissioners have yet to be appointed. Just imagine – there are endless ways in which a new minister could help put manners on RTÉ and other non-conforming broadcasters. And there would be nothing shadowy about it either.The affable Noel Rock, who lost his seat in Dublin North West to Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe, embarked on the Seanad election trail on Friday. It was his first taste of this strange ritual, whereby candidates traverse the country looking for support from county councillors.Councillors make up the vast majority of the Seanad electorate. We rang him early in the evening to find him lost in a rural midlands area, having been misdirected to the home of a Fine Gael councillor only to be greeted by his very elderly father who lives alone.Rock is one of legions of candidates from all parties currently besieging local representatives and making them feel important. “I came around the corner in one place and it was like the queue for Krispy Kreme, or the hand sanitiser in Boots. There was a of line cars belonging to Fine Gael candidates in front of me, all waiting for their turn to go in and the occupant ask for a vote.”So where are you now, Noel? “I haven’t a clue” said the politician reared in the Ballymun flats. “I haven’t seen a house in half an hour.”Some personal news. Having spent the last two weeks taking soundings and formulating a position, I have decided to form myself into a technical group for the purpose of seeking attention.It’s been a very busy time. The phone hasn’t stopped ringing. I have invested in comfortable shoes and they are proving a very wise investment. Now I can walk in comfort to my scheduled twice-daily doorstep briefings inside the gates of Leinster House and then hurry outside with aplomb for those impromptu camera opportunities.The amount of plinth posturing over the last couple of weeks has reached ridiculous proportions. Negotiating teams are in and out every day, declaring the state of play as they see it and what it might take for them to consider lending their brilliance to an incoming administration. Meetings are taking place in a variety of locations in and around Leinster House.The Greens, though, are really going for it. Their meetings with Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil have gone on for hours, and hours. The party is really serious about its climate change agenda and isn’t interested in window dressing options from potential senior government partners.Whereas as other players hold talks with relatively small negotiating teams, the Greens arrive in force with all sorts of policy advisers in tow. This means that the opposite side has to bulk up too. They need a big room. They are holding their meetings with Fianna Fáil in Agriculture House. More specifically, in the headquarters of the National Emergency Centre.

Today’s gathering is going ahead in spite of warnings by the police that they will struggle to control the crowds because they have no idea how many people will turn out. They are worried about possible crush risks and of large numbers of children let loose in an unfamiliar city with no parental supervision.Yes, of course children have a right to protest and express themselves just like everyone else, but at the heart of the #YouthStrike movement is mass law-breaking. Children up to the ago of 16 are mandated to attend school, and yet increasing numbers seem to believe that they have the right to opt out whenever they feel like it – so long as they are representing some fashionable cause.I can understand why children should find it an exciting thing to, to bunk off school to go on a protest – I am sure I would have felt the same when I was their age. But it is disturbing that so many head teachers and parents seem happy to endorse this attitude.It is about time schools put their foot down and told their pupils: look, you’ve made your point. Skip school again and it will be counted as an unauthorised absence, with consequences for your future in the school. In the first instance, anyone taking a day off to join a protest will be put in detention and set an essay. I can suggest a good subject: “explain how Britain could conceivably reach the target demanded by the YouthStrike4Climate movement - total decarbonisation of the economy by 2030.

Mr Sabisky, a super forecaster adept at predicting future trends, was forced to resign after it emerged he had previously made controversial comments about race and eugenics.A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cummings has all the usual responsibility someone in his position has.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"win against wokeness women have right female only lavatories","story":"Women look set to be guaranteed female-only lavatories in public buildings after an outcry over the trend towards gender-neutral facilities. Increasing numbers of publicly accessible lavatories - like those at The Old Vic theatre in London - are being converted into facilities that can be used by all.However, public authorities have a duty to provide safe spaces for women in the lavatories in their buildings, and making all facilities gender-neutral may fall foul of building regulations.Several peers complained this week that gender-neutral lavatories - which one Tory peer, Lord Lucas, said had been introduced by woke public bodies - made women feel uncomfortable.The Conservative hereditary peer called on the Government to explain the terms of the existing law better so managers of public buildings recognised they were able to make lavatories male or female only. Civil servants in the Department for Communities and Local Government have now been asked to write to the British Standards Committee to ask whether technical guidance on building regulations needs to be clarified to make it explicit that women must have access to female-only facilities.A Government source said: It is clear that there needs to be a public service provision for everyone in our community and all people should be treated with dignity and respect.The Government is committed to maintaining safeguards that protect women.Proper provision of separate toilets for both men and for women, which has long been a regulatory requirement, should be retained and improved. Speaking in the House of Lords, Lord Lucas said of the trend for gender-neutral lavatories: Women do not want to wash bloody underwear in front of men. What is the justification for making women feel unsafe, where now they feel safe?  Welcoming the rethink this weekend, Lord Lucas told The Daily : I am delighted that the Government is to make sure public buildings provide properly safe spaces for women.I hope they will also make sure that there are enough such spaces to meet demand - or at least to provide for women\u0027s needs equally with men’s.Raymond Boyd Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, added: Where space and planning allows, the BTA would always support the concept of separate facilities for females and males.The Old Vic was criticised when it converted all of its male and female lavatories to gender-neutral facilities last autumn. The number of toilets increased from 22 to 44, although 18 of them were urinals that could only be used by men.Sarah Ditum, a columnist for The Spectator magazine, said after the refurbishment: The Old Vic’s lavatories have gone from \u0027not enough\u0027 to \u0027none at all\u0027.Patrons are, in theory, free to \u0027self-select\u0027 from blocks labelled stalls-only and blocks containing urinals. The problem is obvious: women cannot use urinals.That means there are 44 toilets for men, but only 26 for women, and only that many for women who are willing to run the gauntlet of penis to get to the stalls alongside the urinals.So provision continues to favour men, but in some ways the situation is even worse than it was before because now men have free access to the only toilets that women can use.She added: A theatre with inadequate women’s toilets, or without women’s toilets at all, is a theatre that doesn’t care whether there are women in its audience.The Old Vic said last October that four out of five visitors either agreed or neither agreed nor disagreed with the redesignation of its lavatories as gender-neutral facilities.It also said 23 of the lavatories are contained within units that contain only cubicled loos in addition to one gender-neutral loo (with enclosed sink) and two wheelchair-accessible loos (with enclosed sink).More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one five people go university would financially better had not","story":"One in five people who go to university would be financially better off if they had not, a major study has found.Each year around 70,000 graduates end up losing money over their lifetime because they did an undergraduate degree, according to an analysis commissioned by the Department for Education.Men studying creative arts subjects are the most likely to be financially worse off for having gone to university, with 97 per cent of them getting a negative return on their investment over their lifetime.Meanwhile, women studying Physics, Pharmacology or Economics are the most likely to gain financially from doing a degree, with 100 per cent of graduates getting a positive return.  The study, carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), used the Longitudinal Education Outcomes dataset which draws together information from tax records of thousands of university graduates.Researchers controlled for students’ school results as well their family background to work out the impact their degree had on their lifetime earnings.  It is the first time that graduates’ lifetime earnings have been forecast based on the type of degree.More than half of young people now go to university, according to the latest official data. The rate has been gradually rising over the past five years, since the Government lifted the cap on student numbers and increased tuition fees to £9,000-a-year, which has since risen to £9,250-a-year.The move, which gave universities a free hand to recruit as many students as they see fit, led to many institutions embarking on rapid expansion projects.  But it has led to accusations that they now act like businesses, seeking to maximise their revenue by recruiting as many students as possible. Universities have been accused by ministers of running “threadbare” courses in an attempt to “get bums on seats”.Writing for The , she said she is “determined to launch a crackdown” on such courses, and urged the higher education regulator to “step in” where universities are falling short. “What concerns me most are those courses that deliver neither the high-quality teaching students deserve, nor the value for money that they and the taxpayer rightly expect,” she said.“In some subjects there is a very high variability in returns depending on where that subject is studied, which students need to be aware of.”The Government spends around £8 billion per year on undergraduate degrees, according to the DfE. But the exchequer makes a loss on around 50 per cent of female and 40 per cent of male students due to the cost of the higher education budget and financing maintenance loans, the research found.Overall, the UK\u0027s graduates still represented a net benefit on average to the taxpayer due to increased income from tax, national insurance receipts and student loan repayments.  Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK which represents vice-Chancellors, said: “The evidence is clear that a degree from the UK’s world-leading university sector continues to give a significant boost to a graduate’s salary and career prospects.  “These graduates, including those who go on to work in sectors where salaries are relatively low, make vital contributions to the wider economy and to society.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 29th february 2020","story":"Mask-clad commuters make their way to work during morning rush hour at the Shinagawa train station in TokyoComment: Universities minister announces crackdown on \u0026#39low quality\u0026#39 coursesSuper Tuesday 2020: when is it, and why is it so important?Comment: Free speech is being crushed by fear of the mob.

It may give rise to a further cycle of fearful selling.It could presage a 20 per cent decline in values, the definition of a “bear market”.More broadly, falling share prices matter in that many of us are invested in stock markets through our pension or other saving schemes.So when markets\u0026nbspfall, we are worse off.It’s estimated that more than $3 trillion of value has been lost from listed companies across the world this week.\u0026nbspHowever, providing we are not about to retire tomorrow we shareholders are only worse off on paper.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only other similar object was spotted in 2006 and has since left its orbit around the Earth.Earth has a new ‘minimoon’, scientists announceThe newly discovered satellite will also leave Earth’s orbit, in the coming months, leaving\u0026nbspastronomers scrambling to get images of the object and understand its origin.“Obtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1525 11. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.1825 8. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2125 5. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? 2325 3. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2425 2. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  125 25. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 425 22. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 625 20. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1425 12.

The swimmer, who won 200m gold in Rio, as well as 400m and 1,500m freestyle golds in London, subsequently asked CAS for a public trial.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSun\u0027s fellow swimmers reacted angrily after FINA initially cleared him of any wrongdoing, with Britain\u0027s Duncan Scott refusing to shake his hand on the podium at the world championships last year in Gwangju. Sun responded to the snub by firing back: “You’re a loser, I’m a winner”.The 10-hour CAS hearing was broadcasted on the court\u0027s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel\u0027s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool. Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction.Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended and he never missed a major event.That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport\u0027s biggest stars in a key market.Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.The blast is believed to be over by now: There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

And from the reaction we saw the people think the same, too.Good luck on this adventure in America and Canada — but I don’t think it will be long before he misses this country so much that he will want to come back and become a fully fledged member of the Royal Family.I hope his self-imposed exile is short-lived, but at the moment he is doing what his we wants and that is commendable. But the grass always looks greener over in the neighbouring field.So, Harry,you get fed up of making speeches to rich businessmen and you want to come back, just jump on the first plane and come home. We will welcome you with open arms.The love this country has for him has never stopped. As far as the nation is concerned he is still their number one member of the Royal Family.Harry is one of those instinctive people who do and say the first thing that comes into their head and when I saw him hugging people in Edinburgh I remembered why the public will always love him.Just before Christmas, when he visited a school in Luton, the students were queuing up to give him a hug before he left. That’s the Harry I know and love. We will miss him.Having toured with Harry for many years, he was a photographer’s dream — even when the tables were turned on me.In a youth club in New Zealand he was asked to put his painted hand on the wall, which he did.And then he rushed across the room and planted it on my head, as you see in the picture above.When we washed up afterwards he rebuked me for telling the whole nation on TV that morning he was going bald — just like his dad.I know his father, Prince Charles, is upset that his son is leaving and William, his best friend for many years, will also be sad to see his brother go.But the Queen has given him a year to review it and he will be welcomed like the prodigal sonhe decides his future is here back in Britain in the world’s number one family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading. The experts have been warning of a possible , deaths in the UK. We need to remember that is a very-worst-case scenario based upon a lot of “s”.But just to be on the safe side, shouldn’t we be carrying out compulsory checks on all visitors flying in from flu-stricken areas Instead of allowing people to “self-report” IN the coffee plantations of Guatemala, Central America, kids lug sacks of coffee beans around for eight hours a day.For this they are paid the princely sum of £. The coffee is used by posh coffee company Nespresso in its overpriced capsules.Nespresso’s “brand ambassador” is the liberal luvvie actor George Clooney. He got more than £million from the company.How about you give some of that money back to the child labourers, George You want to change the world, make it a better place Then enable those children to live dignied lives without back-breaking work all day.I’M proud to have signed up to Toby Young’s Free Speech Union, to defend our freedom of speech.I had to break a pledge of mine to join it.It’s Lent right now – the season of the year when traditionally you give something up. Well, I’d decided to give up donating to charities for a month or so. But happy to make a very noble exception. Never before in our democratic country has free speech been so under threat.It’s OK for gobby old tossers like Toby and me – we have a  to speak. But too often people are hounded from their jobs simply for expressing an opinion. Or barred from speaking at universities in case they upset someone.Or get a midnight visit from the Old Bill because they happened to like a joke about a transgender person.The fightback starts here. Later next month I’ll be visiting universities to unveil a Charter for Academic Freedom, drawn up by my political party, the Social Democrats. Nothing is more precious than the freedom to express one’s opinion.If it offends someone , my suggestion is: OK, sure, now get over it.He was very right-on, was Harvey. Had all the politically correct opinions. Much loved by the Obamas, of course.Always the way, isn’t it  The more a bloke tells you he’s a liberal and a feminist, the more women should reach for the can of Mace.I HAD a bowl of Alpen this week, for the first time in  years.My daughter’s just got a hamster and its food reminded me of the cereal I used to eat as a young teen. Came in a black box with a mountain on it. My mum bought it because she thought it looked posh and foreign.Indeed, I thought it came from Switzerland. It was actually made in Kettering, Northants.Anyway, I had a bowl of the stuff and couldn’t work out why it wasn’t as nice as I remembered.My Facebook friends told me it was because they’ve cut the sugar content. Probably that’s right.But isn’t it also that NOTHING tastes as good as how you remember it  Not Alpen, not Mars bars, not Monster Munch.And definitely not Heinz Sandwich Spread, which tastes to me these days like paint stripper.Have to say, the site seems to me to be run as a kind of grooming parlour for the benefit of middle-aged pervs. But it’s not just that. The longer your kids – and especially the girls – spend online, the greater their chances of developing depression and other mental illnesses.They also end up with a much shorter attention span. Because they spend their days swiping backwards and forwards in a nanosecond.If we’re to avoid rearing a generation of doolally morons, we need to ration the time they spend online.It’s down to us parents to do that – not the State and not even the companies who run the godawful sites.WAS out walking with the dog this week. Saw this weird thing in the sky.Kind of a yellowy-orange. Circular. Looked up a few moments later and it was gone. I had this feeling that I’d seen it before – a long, long time ago. But can’t put a name to it.When will this miserable weather end If you knew you were a bee, would you be happy  I’m not sure I would.One bee told me yesterday: “Bit of a downer, really.“Suddenly realised I’m going to spend my entire le carting loads of pollen back to some enormous idle cow in the hive.“I’d much rather be a wasp, frankly.

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is never a flat out ‘no’, just lots of ‘ooh minister, that’s very courageous’”.One recent victory attributed to Sir Philip was to signicantly simply the new points-based immigration system, stripping it down from an original more complex plan.It can then be built on over time, once it is up and running and offering visas to businesses in the Autumn.One senior Home Office insider dubbed it “a big clash of cultures, a risk manager versus a radical reformer”.As well as the Home Office, the Departments for Transport and the Environment as well as HM Revenue and Customs are also under heavy strain.“Cracks will appear” in them too soon, it is predicted.Insiders say Government lawyers are under the most pressure of all because of the need to draft so much new legislation and treaty agreements, both with the EU and other countries.The Home Office last night refused to deny Sir Philip has issued warnings.Instead, a Home Office spokesman said: “The Home Secretary and Permanent Secretary are deeply concerned about the number of  allegations appearing in the media.“They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has the highest number of heroin deaths in England and  people died from excessive boozing in one year.Joe Roberts, , who is off work with ill-health, told The Sun: “Drugs are bringing the town down. Once it has hold of you, that’s it.“I used to have a drug problem and was taking a lot of cocaine at one point. It took over my le and got so bad I nearly lost my family. I finally stopped because it was either drugs or them.”But why are people in the South living so much longer We visited High Wycombe, in the home counties, a place similar in size to Blackpool but with one of the UK’s HIGHEST le expectancies.In the Bucks commuter town, a girl born today is likely to live past her th birthday, while a boy should reach .Happy locals reckon the Chiltern Hills could have something to do with their long lespan. Veronica Wallace, , said: “Possibly people are living so long because we have to climb the hills. There’s a lot of them about in the area but I love walking.”Ilyas Mohammed, , originally from Pakistan, said: “When I moved to England I loved the greenery of Wycombe.“It reminded me of home and meant I could take my children out and about.”Another resident believes diet plays a part in their longevity.Former local education authority worker Bill Cariven, , said: “Where we are, people eat healthier than where.”The handsome town centre, with its Georgian redbrick architecture, is clean and tidy — yet the area is not without terrying crime.Last year jihadist Nadir Syed was given a le sentence for plotting a Remembrance Day beheading, while -year-old neo-Nazi Jacek Tchorzewski was jailed for four years after he was found guilty of possessing terrorist documents.One person was murdered there in , compared to seven in Blackpool.The signs of deprivation in the North West seaside resort, which has eight of the ten poorest neighbourhoods in England, are plain to see.Crucially, there are also a number of cultural factors.A drug and alcohol problem, like the one facing Blackpool, is a symptom of a community not at ease with itself. The relative weakness of community bonds makes poverty more dficult to bear than in places that benefit from the spirit of self-help.In such circumstances, civic pride is more dficult to sustain and the community is less able to contain antisocial behaviour than in places like High Wycombe, where civic pride prevails. It is not simply ­austerity but the ­combination of a community in trouble and poverty that creates a depressing cycle of diminished expectations.That, in turn, leads to the high ­levels of health problems in towns such as ­Blackpool.But in principle there are no ­barriers to the North recapturing some of its former glory.Yes, it has been left behind. But with serious investment and sound ­Government policies, the spirit of ­community pride will revive.Joe Roberts added: “You just have to walk down the prom and there are druggies everywhere. Blackpool has a lot of people sleeping rough.“The town needs more help to increase people’s quality of le and le expectancy.”Yet despite the challenges Blackpool faces, some are optimistic about the town and what it has to offer. Sarah Brown, , said: “I moved to Blackpool from Coventry five years ago and it’s the best thing I could have done.“Blackpool attracts thousands of people who come here each year to get drunk and have a good time.“Residents might get drawn in to that culture. I have seen it happen but fortunately not to me.”Once reliant on tourism, the number of visitors has plunged from million a year in the Nineties to eight million today.Folk still visit its zoo, amusement park, three piers, aquarium and Madame Tussauds. But tourism jobs are seasonal, so work is scarce in winter.Natalie Crisp, , a kitchen manufacturer, said: “Money is being invested but it is being spent trying to attract tourists. Nothing is being spent to help those living here.” While the national average for benefits claimants is three per cent, in Blackpool it is  per cent.A report from the Institute of Health Equity this week blamed the slowdown in le expectancy in northern towns on poverty and health inequalities.Six years ago men could expect to live a year longer in Blackpool than they can now, while in Wycombe a woman’s le expectancy has steadily risen year on year. Blackpool has one of the highest numbers of fast-food outlets in the country and its obesity levels are double that of the Bucks town.Lydia Shaw, , who works at Madame Tussauds in Blackpool, said: “Low le expectancy also has a lot to do with lestyle and diet.“When I tell people I’m from Blackpool, they pull a face. But like any other town it has its good and bad areas.”Regeneration plans are in place — and High Wycombe can show Blackpool what investment and a burst of civic pride can do.It is now litter-free — a huge improvement on being the fourth-dirtiest town in the South East in  — and the Eden Centre shopping mall opened in  as part of a huge regeneration project.Amdad Mohammad, a -year-old le-drawing artist, said: “We have so many great facilities here.”Four years ago it was voted the most desirable commuter town for people working in London, just a -minute train ride away.Next up is the renovation of the area close to the railway station, with plans to repair the Grade II-listed Brunel Engine Shed.Retired builder William Lambert, , said: “It’s a very open and a lovely place, which may be why people from here live longer.”Whatever the reason, this tale of two cities shows just how stark the North-South ide has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Am I mad  Actually, I think I’m pretty sane, although I may be biased.I’ll explain my reasoning.My abstinence from clothes shopping is no big secret. I’ve mentioned it many times before but I guess in these times of impending climate doom it’s trendier now. The irony, not buying clothes is in fashion.It’s a bit like feminism.That used to be “those bra-burning crazy women”  but now it’s OK. Cool, in fact. Probably because we live in a much more “woke” society.It must be my Blue Peter upbringing. After all, I’m always saying Blue Peter was woke before woke was a thing — the appeals, growing produce in the greenhouse, making things, inclusivity, ersity. It was ahead of the game!Often we overcomplicate matters, overlooking the easy option. Take not buying more clothes, for example. It has so many advantages . . .❶ Keeping your old clothes is a good incentive to stick to the same weight. I pretty much stopped growing by age  so everything I’ve owned since then still fits. Plus I don’t really wear tight clothes either, so fluctuating by a few pounds here and there is OK.❷ I’m pretty lazy and the thought of having to go shopping for clothes feels like a big effort. Even buying online is hard work.What to buy  Will it fit  How do Iit  What a hassle. When I was younger, I liked to shop with friends. But that novelty wore off long ago.Now, as a mum, when I see friends all I want is to have good conversations.❸ Not being fashionable is liberating. You don’t have to hang out with people who judge you on what you wear. You can hang out with people that like you for you. When people glance me up and down to check out my rags, I have a secret sense of satisfaction that I no longer worry what they’re thinking.❹ It’s way cheaper to not buy stuff. Think of all the money you’ll save.❺ I won’t bang on about it but clothes, consumer goods and stuff in general in our society are becoming too dis­pos­able and our Earth can’t cope. We are having to get rid of all of it in landfill and it’s just not sustainable. It’s killing the planet.So it’s a no-brainer.The other day I was with a couple of like-minded friends and one commented on the other’s top.The other replied:  “It’s five years old from HM.” The first laughed, then said: “Mine’s seven years old from Florence And Fred, so there.”Maybe one day we will live in a world where people will judge on how OLD clothes are, rather than how new.So we’ll get to the point where something being “so last year” is a compliment.WHITNEY HOUSTON ed to our shores on Tuesday, hitting the stage in Sheffield in the opening leg of her  UK tour.When I say “”, she hasn’t come back from the afterle but is performing in the form of a hologram.

So far  people have tested positive for the disease in the UK, with close to , having been tested. A man in Surrey was diagnosed with coronavirus on Friday, becoming the first person to test positive having caught it in the UK rather than abroad.The governmentaposs emergency COBRA committee will finally meet on Monday after Boris Johnson agreed to chair crisis talks. Measures being considered reportedly include...Letting schools scrap maximum class sizes and hold lessons outside school in the event of widespread staff absences Suspending lorry driversapos -hours-a-week limit behind the wheel to keep supply chains movingmany truckers fall ill Sending army doctors into hospitals as a worst case scenarioNHS staff levels collapse.Professor Chris Witty, Englandaposs chief medical officer, has told the government it may also have to consider restricting mass gatherings, closing schools and stopping public transport.  He claimed such measures would flatten the peak of the virus. Prof Witty said, according to The Times : “Flattening the peak is very good for the NHS, it may not be good for society, and we’re going have to think that through.” It is hoped these measures could delay a full-blown outbreak until the summer, when NHS services are under less pressure and viruses sp slowly. The UK’s coronavirus pandemic plan is due to be published next week.  The patient diagnosed yesterday is now being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre in London. Meanwhile, a British man, reported to be in his s and said to have lived abroad, was confirmed as the first UK citizen to die from coronavirus. The man, who was on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship which has been quarantined off Japanaposs coast amid the outbreak, was the sixth person from the vessel to have died.  Health Minister Helen Whately said it was likely more people in the UK would contract coronavirus and that plans were in place should it become a pandemic. The Conservative MP told BBC Newsnight: I canapost reiterate enough that we are well prepared but we do have to recognise that it is likely we will see more cases in the UK. We have plans in place and have carried out exercises so in the event of something like a aposflu pandemic, we are ready. Part of the governmentaposs response has been to take over a Holiday Inn near Heathrow Airport.Ambulances thought to be carrying people who recently landed have been going to the hotel commandeered by the Government.  There has been a steady stream of arrivals at the Holiday Inn, which was block-booked under coronavirus contingency measures. Those being taken to the four-star hotel near the airport are visitors to the UK who may have been exposed to Covid- in hot spots such as China, Iran or north Italy.

The majority are begrudgingly fine with it, seeing it as part of the well-paid territory. Occasionally they message you to say you’re now dead to them but it’s very rare for anyone to set their lawyers on to you. However, that’s what David Steel did in , demanding a retraction and payment of costs for writing that the former Liberal leader knew of ­allegations that Cyril Smith had abused boys but did nothing, ­eventually nominating him for a knighthood. The basis for allegations against Smith came from a magazine article, researched in Rochdale, which said the MP had inveigled himself into a ­children’s hostel where he stripped, spanked and fondled the genitals of boys.  But Steel’s lawyers were adamant that my take on events was wrong, and with no other evidence, the Mirror ran this retraction: “Brian Reade stated that David Steel, as he then was, had known of ­allegations that Cyril Smith was ­serially abusing boys, but had done nothing about it. Lord Steel has asked us to point out that he received no complaint against Mr Smith’s activities when a Liberal MP. He was aware from an article in  of allegations against Cyril Smith of unusual behaviour with boys from the first half of the s. He questioned Mr Smith about those ­allegations. Mr Smith denied any wrongdoing and saidthat the matter had already been investigated by the police who had closed their file.” Well, it turns out it’s Steel who owes us at least an apology, after admitting to a sex abuse inquiry that when he confronted Smith about the ­allegations in  he “assumed” them to be true, yet did nothing because the allegations were made before Smith became a Liberal MP. According to some of Smith’s  alleged victims, he carried on abusing boys as young as eight throughout the s. Yet in  Steel recommended him for a knighthood without askinghe was still an abuser. This week the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse issued a damning verdict on Steel, saying he “abdicated his ­responsibility” to act over Smith, viewed him “through the lens of ­political expediency” and was “completely unrepentant” about his inaction.

With more than a dozen states set to pick their winners on one night, the course of the entire election could change. Hereaposs everything you need to know about Super Tuesday and state of the US election campaign.What is Super Tuesday  Super Tuesday is - as its name suggests - the biggest night of the US primary campaign. After a series of one-off primary elections in states like Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada - Tuesday night some  states and one overseas territory will go to the polls to decide on their preferred candidates for the general election. Which states are involved Alabama American SamoaArkansas Calornia Colorado Maine Massachusetts Minnesota North Carolina Oklahoma Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont VirginiaWhen will the results be in  Polls close between pm and .pm Eastern Time, which is between midnight and .am our time. American Samoa is holding a caucus, which is weird and complicated, so itaposs likely to be quite late before results come in - so while results will be dropping in throughout the night, we might not have all the numbers until  or am.  How does the primary process work  Primaries and caucuses  Before each general election, the major parties pick a candidate to run for President. This is done through an excruciatingly long process of primary elections and caucuses, which can last twice as long as the election campaign itself. Party members in each of the  states plus the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the American Virgin Islands and Guam vote for their favoured candidate in either a primary election - a regular apossecret ballotapos style election held across the state - or a caucus, where party members express their preferences more publicly in school halls and community centres. On Super Tuesday, Alaska, Colorado, Minnesota and Wyoming are deciding their nominations with caucuses. Delegates Each state has a certain number of delegates at the partyaposs National Convention, decided by party based on the population of the state. These delegates are awarded to presidential candidates based either on a winner take all principle, or proportionally based on vote share. Superdelegates Just to make it even more confusing, there are a certain number of delegates from each state who can pledge to whichever candidate they like. They tend to be office holders, ex-presidents, members of congress, committee members and state chairs. The Conventions  The end of primary season, and the beginning of the election proper is marked by each partyaposs National Convention. These are similar to party conferences in this country, but on a much grander scale. The multi-day, stadium-sized events are filled with speeches from party grandees, congressmen and presidential candidates. The Conventions build up to an often dramatic floor vote, which decides which candidate the party will nominate for the presidential race. Why does Super Tuesday matter  Itaposs got the potential to make or break candidates for the presidency. Democrats need  delegates to ensure a win, and a third of those are available on Super Tuesday. Which states are the most important  Texas and Calornia are the big ones.

A stunned driver filmed the act from his parked lorry. The offender hauled wooden rubbish from the back of his van and dumped it on the side of a layby. The cam footage was taken on the A, between Cambridge and Coventry. Meanwhile, , mattresses – as high as  Empire State buildingsstacked up – were illegally dumped in England last year. Councils want mattress manufacturers to be forced to recycle their products and offer take-back services. The Local Government Association said fly-tipping is costing taxpayers £million a year to clear up the mess left on roadsides and in public areas. An LGA analysis of industry figures showed annual UK mattress sales of . million, but with only . million recycled. LGA environment spokesman David Renard said: Dumped mattresses made up a quarter of all fly-tipping incidents in some areas in the past five years. Unwanted mattresses are fuelling landfill costs which continue to rise, putting pressure on waste and recycling centres which councils are working hard to keep open.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British family on holiday in Tenere say they were allowed to check in to their hotel just hours before the resort was put on lockdown following a coronavirus outbreak. The Lund familyaposs fun week in the sun quickly turned into a nightmare after they were told they were being quarantined in the resort. Mum-of-two Selina, her husband, Ashley and their children Sam and Violet are among the , guests currently banned from leaving the H Costa Adeje Palace Hotel in Tenere. But the family say they were needless caught up in the scare, and should not have been allowed to enter the hotel in the first place.Speaking to ExaminerLive from the hotel room sheaposs been unable to leave since Monday, Selina said they had been transferred to the hotel just hours before the Canary Island government had put it in lockdown. The drastic measures were put in place after an Italian doctor tested positive for the highly contagious virus .In fact, the Lund family had enjoyed their half-term break at a dferent hotel, but were delayed at the airport after a sand storm led to all flights being grounded last Sunay. They were taken to a nearby hotel to wait for a new flight, but were told it was full, before being advised to get get a taxi to the Costa Adeje Palace, arriving late on Monday after around  hours of travel hell. But within a matter of hours the ordeal only got worse when a letter was pushed under their door early on Tuesday revealing the hotel was the centre of a coronavirus outbreak. Selina said: We donapost knowthe hotel knew somebody was being tested when we arrived. Butthey were we shouldnapost have been allowed in. The problem was because of the calimathere were no rooms anywhere. The couple and their children were ordered to stay in their room for the first  hours but have now been given the all clear, after being tested earlier in the week. The hotel has allowed guests who tested negative to leave their rooms and use the facilities but Selina said they were too scared to risk it after seeing chaos in the restaurant and other guests coughing on food. These four walls are driving me up the wall, she said on their fth day of being trapped on the holiday island. My husband is really down. Itaposs hard, I donapost think the kids will ever want to come to Tenere ever again. Itaposs surreal, itaposs just awful. We just want to come home, we will take a rainy Huddersfield any day over this.  Itaposs just depressing really. Our balcony is just like a cell, it gets about an hour of sunshine a day and all I can see from it is a path and armed police. We went to the restaurant once but my daughter got really stressed and weaposve had food delivered to the room ever since. Itaposs going to be another  hours before we even think about leaving the room again. Weaposve not been to the pool, why would we put ourselves at risk. We had a really good holiday and we donapost want to come home with coronavirus. Speaking on Friday morning, Selina said their morale was particularly low after having their hopes of leaving raised and then dashed. Last night  guests, including  Britons, were told they could leave by the Spanish authorities but Selina said they were not included so far. She said Jet and the Foreign Office had been in touch but they still had no real idea of when they might be able to get a flight home. She said theyaposd run out of clean clothes, toiletries and one of her prescriptions had run out, although the hotel was looking to provide it. And she revealed the nightmare would not end when they got home as the children were almost certainly set to be banned from attending school for two weeks. Shelley College has already confirmed her son, Sam, , will not be allowed to attend, meaning he will have missed three to four weeks of his A-level classes. The school is providing work by email.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailOfficials are trying to work out how a man in Surrey became the first coronavirus patient to catch the disease within the UK. Unlike the other  Covid- positive cases in the country, the unnamed man has not travelled aboard recently. All previous confirmed cases have been passed on overseas, in countries including France, Italy and Iran. The hunt is now on to find people who have been in contact with the man in a bid to stop the virus spreading further. Yesterday the first British person died from the disease while on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which is quarantined in Japan. Health experts have said that tracing the origins of the latest UK case of coronavirus will be crucial in preventing more extensive spread. Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said UK transmission was always a real possibility and that with symptoms very similar to flu, it can be easy for Covid- to go under the radar. He said: This case - a person testing positive for novel coronavirus with no known link to an affected area or known case - marks a new chapter for the UK and it will be crucial to understand where the infection came from to try to prevent more extensive spread.  This was always a concern - this is a virus that frequently causes symptoms very similar to mild flu or a common cold, and itaposs easily transmitted from person to person. This means it can easily go under the radar. Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor at the University of Leeds, said it had been only a matter of time before the first person-to-person transmission in the UK was confirmed. What now becomes critically important is our ability to identy, isolate and care for infected iniduals, and to trace their recent contacts, he said.  If localised outbreaks remain contained then it should be possible to limit the impact upon the UK. However, I suspect the frequency of small outbreaks might increase in coming weeks as the source countries of imported cases become more erse. If we experience a burgeoning epidemic as seen in South Korea it will represent a signicant challenge to our already stretched NHS and public health infrastructure. As directed by WHO, we should use this time window to invest and prepare for such a potential outbreak, whether it happens or not.  Health minister Edward Argar expressed confidence that the disease could be contained. He told BBC Radio aposs Today Programme: Weaposre still in the containment phase of this disease. We have been pretty good at containing it thus far. And the chief medical officer has been very clear that there is no reason to think that we shouldnapost be able to continue containing it, so thataposs what our focus is on. As the diseaseaposs spread across the EU gains pace, the UK government looks to bring in emergency laws to keep the country moving.  Crisis legislation to grant sweeping new powers to public bodies are being considered by senior MPs, according to reports.The governmentaposs emergency COBRA committee will finally meet on Monday after Boris Johnson agreed to chair crisis talks."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk map live tracker","story":"NewsCoronavirus UK map: Live tracker of confirmed cases as Britain hit by deadly bugTwo people who travelled from Iran to London and one person who ed from Northern Italy to Wales have tested positive for the Covid- strain of the diseaseShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-what-know-far-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-uk-map-live-tracker-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

As the virus continues to spread rapidly across the planet, the number of Covid- patients diagnosed in the UK slowly ticks upwards. This morning the Department of Health and Social Care announced that two Brits had contracted the virus while in Iran. Both have ed to London from the Middle Eastern country, which has had the highest number of deaths outside of China. The London patients are being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in the capital, where a number of infected people are also in quarantine. Someone from Swansea in Wales also has the disease following a trip to Northern Italy. Public Health Wales is working to identy those who have come into contact with the patient.  Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at the organisation, said: Public Health Wales is working hard to identy close contacts, and we are taking all appropriate actions to reduce any risk to the publicaposs health. The ages and genders of the newly confirmed patients have not been revealed by the authorities. Yesterday six more people tested positive for Cornavirus in the UK.The highest concentration of patients is to be found in London, where five have been quarantined after flying in from France, one from China, one from Italy and two from Iran. A Chinese student and their mum were diagnosed and quarantined in York, while Derbsyhire has one confirmed patient who spent time out in Tenere. Four people have been isolated at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside having left the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship which became a hotbed for the virus.  Both Belfast and Cardf have a confirmed case each which originated in Italy. In the past day concerns have been raised about the NHSaposs ability to cope with the spread of the virus. It emerged last night that overstretched hospitals here in the UK would be forced to treat only the patients most likely to survive should the virus take hold.

I do it every year - I talk about booking travel insurance ASAB - as soon as you book. “Becauseyou don’t and something happens in the meantime before you get travel insurance, you’re not covered. “Anyone who has booked a holiday now for this year -you have not got travel insurance,you get the travel insurance and the Foreign  Commonwealth Office then says you can’t go to a country, you’re covered. “If the Foreign  Commonwealth Office rules out a country in future and you haven’t got travel insurance at that point, you’re not covered. “Get your travel insurance nowyou’ve booked your holiday. “Becausefor example you have skiing trip and in two weeks time they say ‘you can’t go’ but you haven’t got your travel insurance yet because you are going in four weeks time, you’re not covered. “Butyou get it now, you are covered.

Not all travel insurance policies will cover you for pandemics but you should check and talk to your travel insurer, Martin warned.

The monarch was likely to have sympathy for Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs position - even though their decision to step back from royal le will have disappointed her, the expert claims. Royal historian Robert Lacey told People the Queen remained haunted by the tensions with her younger sister that began as soon as she took the crown.Her job is to survive and ensure the monarchy continues unbroken, Mr Lacey said of the Queen. “She has a particular sensitivity to what Harry has been going through because of her closeness to Margaret and seeing the same dramas and tensions played out two generations ago. Vivacious Margaret struggled to live in her older sisteraposs shadow. The Queen was likely to see parallels between her tensions with her own sibling in the relationships in her grandchildrenaposs generation. Prince Harry is  sixth in line to the throne after his father Prince Charles, and elder brother Prince William and the Duke of Cambridgeaposs children with Kate Middleton, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.

Emily Pritchard, , and partner Ross Jewitt, , were left exhausted following the arrival of their son Jesse in September - because the newborn woke up every two and a half hours without fail. The couple tried everything to get the tot, now aged five months, to bed - even splashing out £ on an expensive course in cranial osteopathy and playing white noise, but nothing seemed to help Jesse settle. Now salon manager Emily, from Braintree, Essex, and Ross, who owns a carpet fitting company, are rejoicing after discovering a aposmiracleapos sleep spray from Boots after it was recommended by a relative in December. The couple claim since they began using Bloom and Blossomaposs The Very Hungry Caterpillar Baby Pillow Spray, Jesse has slept through to the morning for  hours straight every night - and they have enjoyed six weeks of undisturbed snoozing. Emily said: No new mum wants to admit how hard it can be when you bring your baby home and not many people are honest about how hard it can be. I got a big shock when I brought Jesse home. He was waking up every two and a half hours, so I would be up three or four times a night. I was like a zombie and stayed in my pyjamas all day - it was exhausting. Ross was getting up for work completely shattered and Jesse was miserable, whingy and upset because he was so tired.  Lots of people told me it was normal for the first couple of months, but it was still happening in December, four months after he was born. I genuinely thought something was wrong with him: I even took him to the doctors. Desperate to find a solution to Jesseaposs sleep problems, Emily tried everything from playing white noise to getting her son to sleep on his side. After posting on social media about her dilemma, she spoke to her sister-in-law, who recommended Bloom and Blossomaposs The Very Hungry Caterpillar Baby Pillow Spray which was on offer at Boots. The £ spray contains plants known for their calming properties such as Sicilian lavender, jasmine and ylang ylang.  Emily said: The first time I used it, it was like magic. He slept through the whole night for the first time ever. I woke up three or four times that night just out of habit, but every time I checked Jesse he was fast asleep. The following morning I woke up and checked the time. I couldnapost believe it when I realised heaposd slept for  hours. The second night I thought aposthis is the testapos but he slept through for eight hours, and he has slept through every night since. I now use the spray religiously.

She added they had found Mr Brooks and Mrs Maclean to be credible witnesses and their evidence had been supported by a police officer and an environmental health officer from Anglesey Council.

There has been a steady stream of arrivals at the Holiday Inn, which was block-booked under coronavirus contingency measures. Those being taken to the four-star hotel near the airport are visitors to the UK who may have been exposed to Covid- in hot spots such as China, Iran or north Italy. A man living near the hotel said: “It’s concerning to see all this activity. We have three children. “We’d like to know more about why these ambulances are coming into the hotel. We have seen eight in the last two days. They should be giving us more information.” Unlike Britons who have gone into self-isolation in their homes after visiting hot spots, these tourists or business visitors are unlikely to have anywhere  to go. There has been no confirmation about anyone at the hotel having coronavirus symptoms. Vehicles have to pass through a temporary ft-high barrier installed around the hotel grounds.  As ambulances arrive, security guards in face masks can be seen behind the barrier. A van owned by Stericycle, a company specialising in biohazard waste disposal, has been spotted entering the hotel property. Stericycle is working with the NHS to ensure no waste contaminated with coronavirus escapes into the wider environment.  A statement on its website says: “To mitigate risk associated with managing waste contaminated with -CoV, Stericycle has developed a dedicated procedure for the management of this waste.” Delivery lorries thought to be containing catering and cleaning supplies have also arrived. Last night the IHG hotel group, which owns the hotel chain, confirmed the Department of Health has reserved Holiday Inn London – Heathrow Ariel for at least a month. Any other guests who had booked have been relocated to other IHG hotels in the area. Access routes into the hotel have been coned off.  It is near the airport in Hillingdon. The Holiday Inn quarantine site is the first in the capital. The Department of Health said it would not release details of any activity at the hotel. Hundreds of Brits on evacuation flights out of the coronavirus epicentre in Wuhan, China, were the first to be placed in quarantine.  Most were taken to an NHS accommodation block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral. Other evacuees were driven from RAF bases to a hotel and conference centre in Milton Keynes, Bucks.

Two men and a -year-old girl from Vietnam were found crammed inside the tiny compartment on top of HGV driver Robert Rooney’s Ford Focus. A court heard how Rooney, , told officials in the UK controlled zone at the Channel Tunnel in Coquelles, France, the box had “camping stuff” inside. But when Border Force officers opened it, the first thing they saw was a “human arm”. Harrowing pictures show the migrants inside the roof box, which is not much bigger than a suitcase. Prosecutor Bridget Todd told Canterbury crown court the box was, “an airtight concealment”, adding: “There was no attempt to put any ventilation in the box. “Should the box have become detached on the motorway, the result would have been catastrophic.” She added that the dad-of-three had “clearly intended to gain financially” in the smuggling attempt. Rooney, originally from Ireland, had admitted facilitating illegal entry at an earlier hearing. His defence barrister James Burke said his client had been “struggling financially with overdrafts and loans”.  He added: “He succumbed to the temptation of a solution to these problems.” Jailing him for three years today, Judge Catherine Brown said: “These were people who were strangers to you. “It was a high-risk venture given the very cramped conditions. “There would have been no ventilation for them. If there had been a delay in crossing, this could very well have had tragic consequences.

Remi Gosal, , was found dead on a sofa in a student hall on March  last year. He had moved from Canada six months prior to study law and Spanish at the University of Sheffield. In the early hours of the morning, CCTV captured Remi stumbling into the block of flats where he lived, with police noting that he aposappeared quite intoxicatedapos and was aposunsteady on his feetapos. After finding Remi at .pm in the communal kitchen, his friend tried to wake him before noticing his skin was cold to touch, according to Examiner Live. Desperate for help and fearing the worst, his flatmate ran down to find security before dialling  with ambulance staff advising him to try and start CPR on Remi. Paramedics pronounced him dead when they arrived at the flat. A toxicology report found that he had fatal levels of codeine and alprazolam in his bloodstream, with the latter also known under its trade name of Xanax. Remi, who had a black belt in taekwondo, was described as a apossporty and bright boyapos, an inquest on February  heard. His father Sarj Gosal said: His level of drug use was at an addiction level, no doubt. From a cold, objective point of view I’m not surprised because Remi was hospitalised back home a couple of times. “We took him to emergency once because he was on Xanax. He also said there was a strong history of substance abuse within their family and he therefore believed his son was aposcursed from birthapos. Remi didnapost touch a drink for years but once he found alcohol and drugs he was hooked, particularly with the pills and alprazolam, Sarj added.

Multiple severe weather warnings are in place from now until Tuesday covering the whole of the UK - with as many as nine separate Met Office yellow warnings in place for Saturday alone. Storm Jorge will track across the north-west of the UK over the weekend and we can expect some terrible downpours overnight tonight bringing the possibility of flooding and a danger to le from fast flowing or deep floodwater. Not to mention the carnage which will ensue on public transport.Chief meteorologist at the Met Office, Frank Saunders, said: “For the rest of today- and ahead of Storm Jorge’s arrival - there are warnings for rain and snow.The heaviest snowfall – with accumulations of - cm on higher routes – is likely to occur across central Scotland, where snow may fall to lower levels for a time. “From Saturday Storm Jorge will bring strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the UK, with potentially heavy snowfall being a hazard for parts of Scotland.Areas above  metres could see accumulations of - cm of snow, with lower areas - roughly above  metres - seeing accumulations of up to  cm. On Saturday and Sunday, the majority of the UK is covered by Yellow weather warnings with some areas being covered by more than one warning, indicating multiple weather hazards.  The chief forecaster at the West Country-based Met Office warned that Wales could be drowned in as much as mm of rainfall and the UK could see gusts of up to mph. He added: “The heavy rain warnings for parts of Wales, South West England and North West England are indicating that some isolated areas of Wales could see as much as  mm of rainfall. Storm Jorge is not expected to bring wind gusts as strong as Storms Ciara or Dennis, but it will still bring gusts of  to  mph in some exposed locations during the warning period, which ends at midday on Sunday. But itaposs worth saying that parts of the south and east of the UK, once the rain clears early on Saturday, should often be bright, windy and cold over the weekend.” The strong winds over the weekend means people living in the warning areas should pay close attention to the advice of local emergency services, said the Met Office.Meanwhile snow will follow Storm Jorge.  Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, Dan Harris, said: “As Storm Jorge begins to weaken and slowly clear over the weekend weaposll see a trend back to slightly colder conditions, with some potentially disruptive snow over hills and mountains of Scotland and less severe wintry conditions over other hills in the north of the UK.A mixture of rain and hail showers looks likely where.  Away from much of Scotland itaposll remain blustery on Sunday, although not quite as windy as Saturday. “The weather looks likely to remain rather cold and showery into next week and thereaposs a chance of further wet and windy weather around the middle of the week, although confidence in details is very low at this stage.”  Overnight tonightNorthern Ireland There is a severe weather warnings for rain covering a large swathe of Northern Ireland including until am tomorrow including -County Antrim County Armagh County Fermanagh County Londonderry County TyroneIt warns heavy rain may lead to transport disruption and local flooding.

A total of  flood warnings were in place across England and Wales on Friday night, mostly in the south west and along the English-Welsh border, and in Yorkshire. There were also  less serious flood alerts.

And in East Yorkshire, residents were being evacuated from the villages of West Cowick and Lidgate after the River Aire broke its banks.  Four tonnes of sandbags were being laid overnight in East Cowick to help ert water, while  properties were at risk of flooding in nearby Lidgate, the East Riding of Yorkshire council said in a statement. The council later said water from the washland around Snaith was being pumped into the River Don, rain had forced closures on the A and Pontefact Road was being sandbagged as a precaution. But the worst of the wet weather will pass as lunchtime comes around. Persistent snow is expected across higher ground in Scotland and people have been warned to expect travel disruption on road, bus and rail routes. The Met Office warnings persist into Sunday, with most of the country braced for more strong winds, and Scotland for yet more snow.  However, there may be some let-up as the new week begins, with the rain and wind warnings abating, leaving only the wintry showers north of the border. In the West Midlands, flood defences have been repaired in an attempt to prevent a repeat of this weekaposs flooding. Dave Throup, Environment Agencymanager for Herefordshire and Worcestershire, praised the herculean efforts of teams in Ironbridge and Bewdley, along the River Severn.

SallyAnn was just  when she welcomed her first foster child into her home - unexpectedly becoming mum to a -year-old girl who could have been mistaken for her friend.The new mother and her then -year-old fiance Ryan became so close to their daughter they gave her the special role of bridesmaid at their wedding. SallyAnn and Ryan, from the west Midlands, said the small age gap meant they formed a close bond. They went on to foster six more children in three years, as well as having a baby of their own.Speaking about their first foster daughter SallyAnn, now , told The Sun : Sometimes, Iaposd take a step back and think this is really bizarre - but it was really nice. Having her as our bridesmaid was one of our biggest highs as foster carers. SallyAnn had always wanted to be a mum and began work as a private nanny after studying healthcare in college. When she was made redundant, she became a self-employed nanny, working for several foster families. She said the experience gave her a real insight into how much vulnerable children can benefit from fostering and told Ryan it was something sheaposd really want to do.  SallyAnn said she didnapost see the point of her and Ryan waiting another decade or more to have kids, and wanted them to foster before having children of their own. After giving Ryan some time to think about it, she said he came back after just a few weeks with the response aposwhy not aposThe couple became foster carers through Britainaposs largest fostering and adoption charity, The Adolescent and ChildrenapossTrust. Sally-Ann, who had previously worked in early  education , initially thought she would foster a child under seven, but was delighted to welcome a -year-old into her family. At first, we were a little nervous about what to expect and how the match would work, SallyAnn told Coventry Live. Would she respect us as carers, would we get the balance between understanding her and parenting right   Fortunately, other than a few minor challenges expected with parenting a teenager, the placement was very successful and she fitted really well into our family. We found that people would just assume that she was our family member or a friend, which helped when transporting her to social activities with friends and to school, as she preferred to keep her peers from knowing that she was in foster care. We felt so honoured that she agreed to play such a key role on our special day after only living with us for just a few months, SallyAnn added.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSitting upright in a tall-backed chair, his bright, intelligent eyes amused at having to explain yet again how he has lived to be the world’s oldest man, Bob Weighton is counting the days to his th birthday. Born on March , , when there was no such thing as sliced bread, Bob has lived through two world wars and seen five monarchs on the throne and  Prime Ministers in No. But this gruff Yorkshireman is suitably unimpressed at becoming the world’s oldest man, a title he gained when the previous holder died in Japan last week. Because Bob is so much more than that: Japanese-speaker political animal artisan craftsman – and now climate change warrior. He says: “It’s good to see young people taking an interest. All power to Greta Thunberg. “There are small things that we can all do, like not buying meals in plastic trays.” Now living in Alton, Hampshire, Bob is a father of three, grandfather of  and great-grandfather of , so it’s not surprising he worries for the younger generation. His father was Scottish and mother English, but he feels strongly about his connections to Europe.He growls: “Brexit is a total mess. I didn’t want it and the people of England didn’t know what they were asking for.”One of his great-granddaughters gave him the yellow numberplate “Bob III” for his walking frame. But when Bob was a boy growing up in Hull, there were no cars – only horses and carts.  He says: “My father Arthur was a veterinary surgeon and looked after all the horses in the city. My mother Eliza was a housewe. Sadly, she only lived to . She died from breast cancer. She wouldn’t have needed to die nowadays.” Bob had three brothers and three sisters, one of whom died young of diphtheria. He says: “When my granny was still alive there were  people in our house, bang in the middle of Hull. “Our house then bears no resemblance to a modern house. We had no electricity – and Granny was matriarch.”  Bob was six when the First World War started in . He says: “I remember soldiers marching through the streets and the Zeppelin air-raids. We were bombed in Hull as well as London. It was just a chap leaning out of the window and dropping a bomb. But they set things on fire, and during the first raids, I remember hiding under the stairs in the hallway.” After leaving school, Bob followed in the footsteps of his engineer uncle and spent three years in the ship building industry on Tyneside.  He says: “When I came out of my apprenticeship there were absolutely no jobs.” So he volunteered to teach abroad and joined a missionary programme in , going to teach English in a boys’ school in Taiwan. Just before he left, he met his we-to-be Agnes. After they married four years later in Hong Kong, they moved to Canada and then America, where Bob worked as an engineer and translator before moving back to the UK in . Their three children were all born abroad. David, now , in Taiwan, and then Peter and Dorothy in Canada over the following two years.  Sadly, after  years of marriage, Agnes died in  from heart failure. They had just sold their bungalow and bought the three-bedroom flat in the Brendoncare sheltered housing complex in Alton. Bob had to move there without Agnes, and is still there. He crumbles when he remembers his we. He says: “Agnes was a marvellous woman. It’s been  years or more, but I still miss her.” He has the flat to himself, but one of the bedrooms is a workshop, where crafts little wooden windmills. He says: “I started making furniture and toys when the children were young out of financial necessity, now I just do it as a hobby.” Still living independently, the secret to Bob’s longevity has to be his zest for le. His grandson Magnus, , who lives nearby with we Caroline, daughter Elin, seven, and son Esben, five, regularly visits Bob and they speak Japanese together.  Magnus says: “I’m quite rusty now, but Bob can still read and speak the language. He’s also always been really interested in trying new things – even when it was his th birthday, he talked about expanding his horizons. “Bob has lots of friends and a big social circle. It’s what le is – it’s people. “That’s what keeps him going.” Bob has his main meal delivered at lunchtime, but prepares his own cereal for breakfast and makes mushrooms on toast for tea. The kitchen cupboards have the basics, and on the sideboard is a shopping list – one potato, one leek, kippers and smoked haddock, and a favourite, curry. He says: “I don’t eat much meat. I drink when I’m at a wedding or party, but I don’t keep any in the house.”  Bob’s never had a mobile phone and warns: “Social media is eating away at real human intercourse.” On that score, he advises: “Talk to a child asthey were two years older, talk to a man asthey were your own age, and talk to a women asshe were five years younger than she looks.” If Bob has one regret in his long le, it is that he stopped work too soon. He says: “I retired at . It was far too early. I can’t think why people want to retire at , or think that  is an imposition.”  After getting his first birthday card from the Queen when he turned , Bob is not interested in getting another one when he turns . While we are there with Bob, Emma from the Department of Work and Pensions pops round to double-check whether he has changed his mind about getting the Royal greeting card this year. Bob says, politely: “Tell her I’ve got one and I treasure it highly, but I don’t really need another one. “Please make it clear it’s no disrespect to Her Majesty, because I admire her enormously. She’s the only sensible person on the political stage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young couple rent first home","story":"NewsYoung couple rent first home together to find pensioner, , living insideAmy Da Cruz and Matthew Morgan were looking for a house to rent closer to where they worked in Bridgend, so Amys mother posted an advert on Gumtree looking for a house to rentShareCommentsByMegan GrfithsKelly-Ann Mills:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAmy Da Cruz and Matthew Morgan were looking to move into together \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Amy, a -year-old driver, said: We started talking to the landlord on WhatsApp and got really excited about the house. We were sent pictures of the inside and it seemed to have large bedrooms, a driveway, a big kitchen and garden, so we were really keen. Before the couple could look around the property, the landlord, who claimed to have recently moved from the area to Plymouth, said that he needed the security deposit in advance on the advice from his solicitor. He claimed this would ensure that the couple would be able to afford to rent the property. Amy said: We really wanted the house. So we paid £ in two payments on the understanding that we would get the money backwe didnapost like the house. On the day of the viewing, the couple were still extremely eager to obtain the property and were asked to pay a further £ as the first monthaposs rent. All of the emails and texts mentioned his solicitor and we had seen a copy of the tenancy agreement, so we had no reason to believe that something wasnapost right. The couple transferred the extra money. But when they went to the house, they found that the house was occupied by itaposs actual owner - who had no idea his home had been ly placed on the rental market. I was so annoyed, fumed Amy. I emailed the landlord straight away asking what was going on. They emailed back saying that they had injured their foot and that they would meet us the next day. We knew something was up. I asked for the money back, but have not heard from them since.  Matthew, , had already given notice on his current lodgings but was fortunately able to reverse this before they found a new tenant. However, he and his girlfriend had been left £ out of pocket. We will never do something like this again, said Amy. From now on we will only go through property management companies and never give money over before. We had our heart set on this place, we thought this would be our family home. Unfortunately, because Amy transferred the money willingly, her bank have said she is unlikely to get it back. Frank Ballinger has lived at the property in Brackla for around  years. The -year-old has described the moment he met the couple and realised that his home was offered for rent without his knowledge. The couple came here one afternoon and they said that they were here to look at the house, Mr Ballinger, a retired special constable at South Wales Police, said.

Tokyo has no Plan B for this yearaposs Summer Olympics despite alarm over the spread of Covid- in Japan and where with just five months to go before the event, a senior official said today. Thataposs despite fears mass gatherings around the world could face postponements or cancellations for months as countries grapple with the spread of the virus. There will not be one bit of change in holding the Games as planned, Katsura Enyo, deputy director general of the Tokyo  Preparation Bureau at the city government, told Reuters. Japan has invested more than £ billion and years of planning into its turn hosting the coveted Olympic Games event. Japan is eager to quell fears the Games might be called off, postponed or moved to a dferent location due to the virus, as the country tops  cases and five deaths so far. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach bolstered Tokyoaposs stance on Thursday, saying his organization was fully committed to holding the games on schedule.  Yet earlier this week Disneyland Tokyo was temporarily forced to close due to fears over the spread of coronavirus. The Disneyland and DisneySea parks in the Japanese capital will remain closed until at least March , the company announced today. What will happen to major UK events  Brits are being warned fears about the virus may now impact events later on in the year - past the two-month potential warning period - as the UK confirms its th case of coronavirus. A British man sick with the virus was today confirmed to have died aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan. Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said yesterday there could be a social costthe virus intensies. One of the things thataposs really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do weaposre going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months, he said.  Prof Whitty said he was not saying that would happen, but that the effectiveness of such strategies would have to be weighed up against the social impact. School closures are already taking place and the cancellation of some major mass gatherings looks possible as health authorities work to contain the virusapos spread.There are fears Royal Ascot , which attracts , people across five days in mid-June, could be impacted.There are also concerns the virus could impact the five-day Glastonbury Festival in late June, where , tickets have already been sold. Comic Con organisers have said they are actively and continuously monitoring the outbreak ahead of the large convention scheduled to descend on London in May. Organisers said strengthened medical support and an increased availability of disinfectants will be available at the event which takes place over three days and attracts tens of thousands.  Coronavirus has already forced event cancellations Fears over the spread of the virus have already prompted the cancellation of several large events across the globe. A Six Nations match between Ireland and Italy scheduled for March  in Dublin has been postponed as tournament chiefs are set to gather in Paris next week. Englandaposs trip to Rome on March  is now in grave doubt due to the virusapos stranglehold in northern Italy, which has become a major centre of infection with  towns in lockdown.  The final two stages of the cycling UAE Tour were cancelled yesterday after two members of staff on the race became ill. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome and star sprinter Mark Cavendish are among riders who will be tested for the virus. Five Italian Serie A football matches will be played behind closed doors this weekend rather than being postponed.

rightly so, he’s made a huge dference at the back.Crucially, though, the rest of the team have also upped their game.Jordon Forster has been excellent in the last three matches, heading and kicking anything coming his way with one of each of those resulting in the opening goal in the last two games.Josh Meekings is also looking like getting back to the player we all know he can be and his long

now is to ensure those good feelings continue over the next few weeks.We’ve seen it too often already this season where it looks like the Dark Blues have turned the corner but then, as soon as that thought appears, their form has headed straight into a ditch.Saturday is a big game for them to show they can keep on the road to second spot and an easier play-off route.Make no bones about it, Arbroath is a far bigger task than taking on Partick Thistle and Queen of the South, no disrespect to the league’s bottom two sides.Dick Campbell’s side are full of it and loving every minute of taking on the big boys in the Championship.I have to admit I expected them to drop away as the season wore on but they are showing the kind of durability that can see them take a place in the end-of-season play-offs.After that, it’s Alloa at Dens and then Ayr home and away back-to-back before Dunfermline come calling – that’s four home games in the next five matches. vw, px\"  What a great

Dferent scouts and dferent analysts have been given dferent leagues to look at.“They look after two or three leagues each and work along with head of recruitment Russ Richardson and myself to identy players and positions that we are looking at.“It is their call as well to flag up any players that jump out at them.“We then dig a bit deeper in terms of the contract situation and availability.“Then myself, Russ and the staff start to look more deeply at the players and all the rest of it.“Some get discarded very quickly for dferent reasons.“Ronald was one that was flagged up to us in the summer on our system.“He was the type of full-back we were looking to bring in.”McInnes’ scouting network identied Venezuelan Hernandez playing for Stabaek in Norway, before their link-up with Atlanta.However, the MLS side subsequently opened the way for the Dons to contact the South American’s agent.Due to the link up with Atlanta, the Dons will also have access to scouting data from the South American leagues which the MLS side have focused on.Ultimately the partnership is a two-way street as the Reds can also help Atlanta by identying European targets.McInnes said: “The South American leagues are an area where Atlanta have expertise and boots on the ground.”Aberdeen may now be casting the net far and wide in the hunt for talent, but McInnes emphasised that will not be to the detriment of sourcing Scottish players.

They know the standard that has been set and it is up to us to show this squad is capable of that.”Aberdeen battled back from the brink in the previous round when overcoming a - deficit with only four minutes remaining of extra time in Kilmarnock.Two goals in the final minute of the fth round replay secured a memorable turnaround and kept the dream of lting the trophy for the first time in  years alive.McInnes said: “That showed me and everyone just how important the Scottish Cup is to them.“Also how much they want to do well. People maybe thought we were down and out against Kilmarnock but we then scored those two late goals.“That win was no less than we deserved as we were the far better team in the second half.“We were the better team in extra time and there was that resilience about us.“Now we are down to eight teams left in the Scottish Cup.“It is a weekend for us to enjoy and we have to take the opportunity to hopefully get into the last four and get back to Hampden.”McInnes ended a -year trophy drought in his first full season as Dons manager when lting the League Cup in .Since then the Reds have reached a further three finals, two in the League Cup and the Scottish Cup in .He is under no illusion as to the demands from the supporters of a strong cup run and also the benefits that can deliver.He said: “I know the importance of cups to this club.“A good cup run brings a feel good factor, numbers swell and the anticipation and excitement gets greater.“There is also the financial side. There are so many benefits from a strong cup run.”Aberdeen will welcome back midfielders Ojo and Bryson tomorrow having been ruled out of the - loss to Ross County.McInnes said: “Ojo and Bryson have been back in training which is brilliant for us.“Ojo missed the game with stitches and Bryson had a knock but nothing which we thought would keep him out of this one.“Ojo had  stitches and the nature of where it is caused problems. He wasn’t ready for Ross County because the likelihood was that would have opened up againhe had played.“We were always hopeful he would be okay for the cup tie.“It is good to have that strength again and options through the middle.”Winger Ryan Hedges is ruled out with a thigh strain suffered in the development squad’s - Reserve Cup semi-final defeat of Motherwell on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along. We did not have the new kitchen then. The hotel has always cooked the turkeys for us but cooking big pots of potatoes and vegetables was quite a job with just the gas rings. Back then, we had ice-cream and jelly for dessert.#Jean added: #It was all good fun and we had loads of laughs.#Elma continued: #We used to have sales to raise money for the dinner. Santa was on the stage and Jean’s children were his elves. They were only little then.#We modelled the clothes and the older women loved the bargains. We thought they were old, but they were probably the age we are now,# Elma said laughing. #We would shout #Roll up, roll up# to get them to come and see what we had on offer.#After a warm welcome from compère Martin Jefferies and a prayer of thanks for the food, the five-course meal was expertly served by members of the organising committee and their youthful helpers.A raffle, again free of charge, saw a large number of guests receive prizes and no-one was left disappointed as the remainder of the guests received selection boxes.Tarbert’s seniors showed they know how to party as dancers left their seats and enthusiastically took to the floor as soon as the musical entertainment began.A stunned Margaret Henderson was named #Citizen of the Year#, confessing she never expected to win the award.For more than  years, Margaret has collected money to support the Tarbert Sea Food Festival and Music Festival. Later, Margaret dressed up as Mrs Brown from Mrs Brown’s Boys to entertain the audience, something for which she is well-known.Martin Jefferies thanked everyone who had helped make the evening such a success with the happy gathering agreeing with loud applause.By Joan Crooks"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us.

The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"famously-hawick-set-tour","story":"A PROJECT to promote Hawick has just launched an imaginative range of guided tours.Famously Hawick wants to provide visitors with an experience of the towns rich manufacturing heritage.And they hope the new all-year-round tours will demonstrate why Hawick gained an international reputation for producing high quality goods.These new lsquoexperience packagesrsquo are the latest development from the collaboration of premium producers in the town.Successfully launched last year, Famously Hawick promotes The Borders Distillery, Hawico, Johnstons of Elgin, William Lockie and Lovat Mill as the Cashmere, Tweed and Whisky town.But based on feedback, visitors didnt want to just buy the quality goods, they wanted to see where they came from and how they were made.As a result, Famously Hawick tour packages have been created.There are three dferent experience packages available - An Introduction to Famously Hawick, which is an independently led tour, The Famously Hawick Experience, which is a fully guided tour including lunch, and the Famously Hawick Gold Standard, which is a fully bespoke tour.The tours can be booked online at www.famouslyhawick"},{"url":null,"title":"council-spend-730k-new-hq-canteen-reception","story":"COUNCILLORS are set to rubber-stamp spending more than pound, on creating a new reception and canteen at their headquarters.As part of the forthcoming years budget proposals, pound, has been earmarked for the building with a further pound, to be spent on demolition of the old canteen.The proposals are part of the planned   capital spend.A spokesman told us: \"The existing staff canteen building at Scottish Borders Council headquarters, which also contains meeting rooms and storage, is le expired.\"The council is establishing a lsquograb and gorsquo facility as part of improvement works to the public reception area of the main headquarters building.\"This will enable the canteen building to be demolished, delivering savings in respect of rates, maintenance, lighting and heating."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-clark-driving-trail-cover-scenic-borders","story":"A CROSS-BORDERS driving trail has been created for visitors wanting to learn more about rallying icon, Jim Clark.The -mile adventure trail will take drivers on a tour of the Borders with pit-stops showcasing regional beauty spots as well as locations steeped in motorsport history.Launched by the Jim Clark Trust, the trail hopes to engage visitors and help them discover the places and stories behind the former double Formula One Champion, Clark.The trail starts and ends at the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum, Duns, and is completely free of charge as it is designed to enhance the experience had at the museum.From the museum, a trail map guides visitors to Chirnside, Jim Clarks hometown and final resting place, then to Berwick-Upon-Tweed where Jim began his racing career.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs.

You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

I got the bus here today and walked through town and Irsquoll do the reverse going home. Itrsquos how I normally travel. Nobody comes near me. So, that side of it is easy to manage.Perhaps it shouldnrsquot surprise us that writers go unnoticed, but Doyle, you might think, would be a special case. Since his first novel The Commitments was published in  and certainly since it was turned into a movie a few years later, Doyle has been public property in Ireland. He won the Booker Prize for his  novel Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha, seen his first three books turned into movies, and has been lauded and loathed in his home country for his presentation of Dublin and Ireland in novels and on the big and small screen. The first episode of Family, the hard-hitting  TV series about domestic violence and poverty was watched by half of Irelandrsquos adult population. And they all had an opinion on it. Politicians and church leaders railed against it. There was even a death threat made against Doyle. Things have, thankfully, rarely been so heated since but he remains part of the national conversation.Hersquos good at talking. So much so that he is about to embark on a -date Conversations with Roddy Doyle tour, which is the reason Irsquom here, although wersquoll spend most of our time talking about Dublin and time and mortality and the appeal of a Dublin pub.But the tour first. Where did the idea come from  ldquoAround spring and autumn invites to festivals come in, he begins, in way of explanation. ldquoThere seems to be a huge appetite for festivals. I donrsquot really share it, Irsquove got to say. I couldnrsquot get worked up about going to hear writers talk, but people in the production company and my agency have been to events that I do, and they enjoyed them, and they thought they were good standalone things.ldquoSo, I was persuaded and not with much dficulty to go on this tour. Itrsquos  events. Itrsquos not rock n roll. There is no rider. I wonrsquot be flinging the television out of the hotel window.No karaoke then  ldquoI wonrsquot be breaking into song, no. Not yet anyway.Instead, hersquoll do a bit of talking and a bit of reading. Among writers only fellow Irishman Sebastian Barry might be better at the latter. It is a chance to size up a letime of work.ldquoI have  novels to choose from and two collections of short stories so therersquos plenty, he says. ldquoIrsquom more comfortable looking back on my old work than I used to be. I used to just run away from it when it was finished as quickly as I could and become immersed in something new. And I still try to immerse myself in something new, but I donrsquot need to deny my catalogue.Why do you think you did in the past  ldquoI didnrsquot want to wallow in it. I was afraid I might try to replicate it. Probably the best decision I ever made when I won the Booker Prize for Paddy Clarke was to make the decision never to go back there, never go back to him. I forgot about that book to the extent that I almost forgot Irsquod written it and forgot that I had been involved in The Commitments movie, for example. Itrsquos when my kids started watching it years later that I began to reclaim it.ldquoI suppose Irsquom at an age where Irsquom calmer about it. The Snapper [his second novel about an unmarried teenage pregnancy] in this country, the film particularly, is known off by heart. Itrsquos on every Christmas. Itrsquos a family occasion. I did a stage adaptation and they did a great job but, in many ways, you didnrsquot need it. The audience could have sat there and recited it to one another and just laughed.ldquoThat seemed to me a terric thing. I felt very lucky. Irsquom happy to look back on that work now.Read More: \"Cant you feel the anger \" David Baddiel on social media trollsItrsquos dficult to think of a Scottish equivalent to Doyle, someone whose work has been so central to the national conversation from the beginning. Irvine Welsh at a push, maybe, but it is a big push. ldquoIrsquove always considered myself a political writer, Doyle suggests. ldquoI donrsquot look around for issues. I create characters and the characters bring issues with them. Irsquove written about characters who were unemployed, characters who were pregnant outside marriage at a time when that was very signicant, characters who have been victims of violence in the home. In the last novel Smile the narrator has been abused by a Christian Brother.ldquoI could spend a considerable amount of time in radio studios or on the phone claiming some sort of expertise but beyond my writing I donrsquot. My job is trying to tell a story. I very rarely go beyond the pages of the book and start talking in a general sense. Therersquos an election on the moment and Irsquom not opening my mouth. Itrsquos a few days before the Irish election when we meet. There are posters on every lamp post. The front page of Thehas splashedon a poll that suggests surging support for Sinn Fein. Doyle wonrsquot say who he will vote for or who others should vote for. ldquoIf somebody like myself said, lsquovote for this party,rsquo it would irritate the hell out of me.That said, scratch the surface and hersquoll talk more generally about the soon-to-be-ex Taoiseach , about the crisis of homelessness in Dublin and about the cityrsquos affordability ndash or lack of it ndash for the younger generations. All parties have embraced the need for more council housing, he points out.ldquoSome of them are saying people can then buy them, which will just restart the problem ,  years down the line. Therersquos an obsession with home ownership. Itrsquos not a Dublin problem. Itrsquos an Irish problem and it may go back to the land wars in the s and the famine.Still, unlike the UK, where Brexit was a vote led by the elderly, Ireland has seen younger generations direct the arguments over same sex marriage and abortion.ldquoIt will be interesting to seethey all come out this election. It could be the breakdown of the old system and the old notion that you havenrsquot truly become an adult until you own a house, which is probably unique in Europe to Britain and Ireland.ldquoI speak as a homeowner. I wonrsquot be giving it away. My kids can do what they want with it when Irsquom not around.Doylersquos writing le began before fatherhood . Itrsquos now more than  years since Doyle, then in his late twenties, wrote The Commitments. ldquoItrsquos  years since the film, he adds. ldquoHow do you measure  years  Itrsquos hard to accept that  is  years ago.\"I was just thinking today, my father died six years ago. Thatrsquos one-tenth of my le effectively and it doesnrsquot feel like that at all. It feels like last year perhaps, whereas something that happened in my childhood feels like where it should be, half a century away. The way we measure time changes as we get older, which is interesting as a facet of storytelling.I want to ask him about that -year-old teacher who wrote The Commitments, when he was known as \"PunkDoyle\". How punk were you, Roddy  ldquoNot particularly. I liked a lot of the music. I had a pair of Doc Martens and an earring.An earring in an Irish school  ldquoI took it out for the interview. I couldnrsquot lsquofindrsquo it that morning. Wore a suit. The dress code was quite casual.ldquoI loved The Clash and the Sex Pistols. Still do. But I was never a punk. Never close to being a punk. It just seemed another kind of unorm. I was called lsquoPunkrsquo in school because of the earring and the Doc Martens. That was it, really. There were other Doyles on the staff inevitably and one of them was called Dozy, so I was better off.When he sat down to write that first book, what was he reacting against  ldquoI wasnrsquot reacting against anything really. It was much more positive than that. It was much more joyousyou like. Therersquos an anger. Therersquos an energy. There always has been, always will be. Butthere is such a thing, it was a joyous anger. It was an appreciation of where I came from, what I had, and I think teaching gave me that.ldquoI was listening to the kids around me and remembering when this place was a field because it was more rural when I was a child. That would have been Paddy Clarke. I began to realise the spirit of the place and the energy of the place was there to be used. That was what I was picking up on when I wrote The Commitments.The Commitments and all of Doylersquos novels hum with the rhythm of Dublin speech. As a reader, I guess Irsquove grown up alongside Doyle. The twentysomething I was when I fell so avidly on those Barrytown novels was in my late forties when his short story collection Bullfighting appeared with its attendant intimations of middle age and mortality.Doyle writes what he knows. ldquoTo me it feels natural. This is the material that I have now. My father was , so hersquod led a good le, been healthy, good in his head right to the day before he died. So, grief announces itself in a way it hadnrsquot before. Irsquod had friends who had died, but this was a dferent one, this was your father.He wrote a play, Two Pints, that drew on this. ldquoI think itrsquos the best thing Irsquove written in many, many ways and also I could see it as some kind of tribute to my da.His new book Love which comes out in May sts through similar themes. Itrsquos about male friendships, middle age and dying parents. Doylersquos mother died while he was writing it. ldquoItrsquos bizarre becoming an orphan at the age of . And I think from a writing point of view itrsquos interesting. Itrsquos interesting getting older, mortality, slowing down, speeding up in some ways. Time, the things it does to you. The sense of redundancy when your children grow up and they donrsquot need you. Nobody wants to get older, but it is rich material for writing.ldquoLess and less people will read it. The book clubs are overwhelmingly women and they donrsquot want to read about ageing men. Ageing men want to read about Hitler and Stalin and football. They donrsquot want to read about themselves. But nevertheless hellipThe new book is essentially about a mid-le crisis. Is that a real thing  ldquoI donrsquot know, to be honest. I donrsquot know whatrsquos the extent of the crisis, in terms of how expensive the motorbike is or how long it lasts  How do measure a crisis You havenrsquot bought a motorbike  ldquoNo, but I know people who have. Itrsquos rusting in the back garden. Irsquom nearly  now, so whatever I do it wonrsquot be mid-anything. I didnrsquot go off to explore the world. I didnrsquot go to hellip What do you call it  Burning Man. So, maybe I missed an opportunity.Love is a novel about missed opportunities. Itrsquos dark and comic and sad and takes place mostly in Dublin pubs. There are a lot of pubs in it, Roddy. ldquoAnd, actually, a fraction of a fraction of the ones that could have been chosen.What is the appeal  \"Itrsquos hard to explain. Itrsquos the sense at certain times of dayof calm. The sense of it being slightly forbidden, which is great. It does good things for the self-respect. I really should be somewhere .\"Therersquos a pub near here I could sit in, and I mightnrsquot talk to anybody but I amlistening to the conversation. And theyrsquore looking at the race on the telly and I feel somehow involved, even though I donrsquot have skin in the game. Somehow I know thatI said something it would be answered and then yoursquore in.\"You say at one point that the pub is a ldquoshy manrsquos haven. Are you that shy man ldquoCould be, yeah. I can feel at home in a pub. Depends on the pub, depends on the time of day, but, yes, I could be that shy man. I suspect a man who isnrsquot shy couldnrsquot have come up with that line.ldquoI have very close friends, men I have known since I was a child and we meet regularly. I havenrsquot been in their houses in decades. We donrsquot do that. We go to the football and we meet in a pub and we have the autopsy in a pub and itrsquos like the football is the meat in a sandwich in a way.ldquoIf I didnrsquot drink,I was warned off the alcohol orI was an alcoholic this might be a very dferent conversation, but Irsquom not. Itrsquos a good question. Would I be comfortable in a pubIrsquod done damage to myself and drinking is dangerous  I suspect I probably could be. Luckily, I donrsquot have to.Love, as he has already said, is about two ageing men. Two ageing men talking, increasingly drunkenly, about their feelings. Are we as a gender getting better at that  ldquoI think maybe. I do know there are people who, when you are talking about a problem, get it and there are others ndash and itrsquos not just men ndash who root around in their memories and say, lsquoThis happened to someone ,rsquo asit is a card game. lsquoIrsquoll top your king with an ace.rsquoHisfather, he recalls, was fostered as a child. \"He was sent out of the house to a relationshouse miles and miles from where he lived. It was a huge family, he was the eldest.The pressure was on for space and money, I suspect. And He didnrsquotsee his mother for a year at least.\"I was trying to draw him out on it, but he was very reluctant to say that he was devastated.Very reluctant. He did say that an older cousin met him and realised he wasnrsquot happy and went to my grandmother and told her and that was the end of that, whereas I know myself,it had occurred to me, Irsquod make more of it.I would be more open about talking about it. So there are things like that that suggest we are better at talking about it, but itrsquos a huge generalisation.\"Your new book is called Love. Whatrsquos your definition of that word, Roddy  ldquoI donrsquot have one. Itrsquos such a vague word. I love coffee. I love my children. I love my we. I love Dublin. I love a bag of chips. And the word is perfectly accurate on all occasions. And it means entirely dferent things. So, I donrsquot really know.ldquoI wonrsquot be losing sleep trying to define love, but you have indicated that I am going to be answering that f****** question quite a lot in the next six months.We walk outside to take photographs. People walk past, look at him and walk on. Soon, he will get back on the bus to go home. He loves this city, he says. Not uncritically, but wholeheartedly.He might not be a writerhe hadnrsquot lived here, he says. Or at least hersquod be a very dferent one. Inevitably Dublin is very dferent to the city he grew up in. Itrsquos older, hersquos older, we are all older. The world moves on.ldquoIf I was somehow trying to recreate the city of my youth you could find corners, Roddy Doyle says. ldquoYou could find a few pubs that look the same. Luckily, the toilets are a good deal better. Theyrsquore lit, for example.Letrsquos run with that idea. Roddy Doyle has lit up Dublin. In his books we can see it in all its colours. Thatrsquos something, isnrsquot it  Thatrsquos worth being recognised for.Conversations with Roddy Doyle is on at the Queens Hall, Edinburgh on March .

At the same time, car travel increased with a record number - three million - of cars now registered in Scotland.Overall, journeys made by public transport have fallen by eight million over the past year.People have a peculiar snobbery about bus travel that they do not have about trains. That quote, oft attributed to Margaret Thatcher, about bus travel being a sign of personal failure casts a long shadow. And there arent leagues of bus spotters hanging about depots in the manner of locomotive lovers.There seems to be a notion that buses are for the working classes, and not the respectable ones. Those who choose other modes of transport already seem to think the bus is a wild west wilderness and thats before the marauding young folk are added to the mix.Bus clientele, though, are attracted by convenience. Not everyone lives near or within walking distance of a train station but most streets have a bus route to serve them.Certainly the customer base is not attracted by a bargain. To travel by train from my home to Glasgow city centre is pound. for a . To travel the same distance by bus is pound. Thats a signicant sum to travel just over one mile.When I moved into my flat in  the bus fare for a single was p and remained so for over a year. Its now pound., a  per cent increase.Im sure the operator would point out that I can get the fare marginally cheaper by downloading its app and purchasing tickets that way but to do so would involve buying an updated smart phone, which Im not inclined to do. Nor should I be - bus travel should be affordable.While the bus network is in the control of private companies, it will always be designed to serve profit over people. In Glasgow there have been several services threatened with the axe and others axed completely. First Glasgow says these routes are not well used enough to continue but, for those who do use them, they are a leline.Were I still a teenager, the new concessionary scheme would be nothing to mebecause the bus route that serves the area of Coatbridge where I used to live has been stopped by First Glasgow. I used to take it in one direction to get to school and in the other direction to get into Glasgow for work.It was vital because the local train line didnt - and didnt until  - run on a Sunday, which is extraordinary when you stop to think about it.The route that was stopped, the , was the only direct service from that part of Coatbridge in to Glasgow, the only direct service up to Airdrie and also served Monklands University Hospital, all the local supermarket, the main GP surgery and the town centre. Now the area is served by a selection of shuttle buses, some that dont run on a Sunday, some that take long weekends off and some that run once an hour.I cant imagine its a unique case but it does illustrate the need for buses to be publicly owned and designed to serve the public rather than monetise them.:Richard Leonard targets free bus travel for all across ScotlandIf one of the main aims of the National Concessionary Travel scheme is to improve the environment then extend it to make bus travel free for all. Driving is infinitely more convenient than taking the bus so its no wonder that car journeys are on the increase.Buses are slow and expensive. To get to a recent hospital appointment I could have driven in  minutes for free. The bus takes  minutes and costs pound. for an all day ticket. Where is the inducement to spend nearly a fiver to sit for more than an hour on a bus when you can do acommute in comfort for  minutes \"Environment benefits\" are an opaque concept to many commuters. So far government and local council policy has been to force drivers away from their cars by punishment - raising parking costs, say - when motorists may respond more to luring than force.Raising fuel duty to make car use more unattractive is the right way to go but, once out of their cars, drivers need to know that money is being invested in a coherent, high quality and extensive bus service that preferably runs  hours.Free travel for children is a solid start but the next step needs to be ensuring bus travel is still an attractive proposition once they hit the age of ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8766988.jpg?type=article-full","title":"new-study-uncovers-30-descendants-family-signed-declaration-arbroath","story":"A specic genetic group belonging to the Boyd family, which included the Earls of Kilmarnock, was identied as stretching back to around  -  years before the document calling on the Pope to recognise Scotland as an independent state was signed.London-based architect Tim Boyd, a confirmed descendant of constable of Scotland Gilbert Hay and Sir Robert Boyd of Noddsdale, was invited to take a Y-DNA test to create a genetic marker by researchers at Strathclyde University.:Iconic Declaration of Arbroath on display to mark th anniversaryThis information was then used to distinguish noble Boyds from others with the same surname by matching the similar genetic strands, helping to identy  members of the noble family from as far afield as the United States.It is the latest part of a project aimed at celebrating the th anniversary of the document being signed at Arbroath Abbey.Researchers are also seeking the Dunbar, Lindsay, Seton, Sinclair, Stewart and Sutherland families in a bid to bring together distant relatives of the signatories for a special exhibition at the Abbey on July .Hay was made Heritable Constable of Scotland by Robert The Bruce in  following the Battle of Bannockburn.Sir Robert never held a title, but was an eminent backer of Bruce during the wars of independence.Arbroath Abbey will host a special exhibition with the descendants of the families on July Graham Holton, Lead Tutor in Strathclydersquos Genealogy Staff Team, said: ldquoThe genetic group we have identied forms part of R-U and several more specic genetic markers have also been identied via advanced testing.ldquoThey distinguish this notable family from others of the Boyd surname, some of whom have a very interesting male ancestry of African origin, belonging to another genetic group, A-M.He added: ldquoAround  of the members of the Boyd Y-DNA project now know that they belong to the Boyds of Kilmarnock.

They warn many areas are now at ldquocrisis point.In an interview to be published in tomorrowrsquos Herald on Sunday, Mr Kerley said a wide-ranging review could help shape a sustainable future for local government.He said: ldquoI think it would be helpful to have another review of what we expect local government to do, and how we expect local government to do it.ldquoWhat is appropriate to charge for and not charge for  Because that makes a signicantdference in terms of the usage of facilities and services.He added: ldquoI donrsquot think it can be done by just saying, lsquoOkay, wersquoll increase this tax or that tax, or stop doing thatrsquo.The academic said the review could examine what services Scots expect councils to deliver, ldquoand how we might raise some of the money to do that, some of which could be raised locally, some of which would be raised through general taxation as it is now.He said it could involve representatives from all of Scotlandrsquos councils and the government ldquoand citizens as well.Mr Kerley, professor of management at Queen Margaret University, said: ldquoWersquove seen experiments in terms of the Citizens Assembly.You could incorporate something like that ndash plus people who have a particular interest.He said the current Citizensrsquo Assembly of Scotland, which brings together more than  people randomly recruited from across the country to discuss key issues facing it, has shown such an exercise is ldquoperfectly possible.In the years since devolution, there have been a number of reviews set up to consider local taxation.In , the Local Government Finance Review Committee proposed a ldquoradical alternative to council tax. Itrecommended a ldquonew progressive Local Property Tax... based on the capital value of inidual properties.Around a decade later, the Commission on Local Tax Reform recommended a programme of changes, including multiple forms of tax and a review of central grants.The Barclay Review into business rates in  also examined the role of local authorities.Mr Kerley said it is ldquoundisputed the proportion of central government spend that has gone to support local government over the past X years has been decreasing gradually compared to other areas of spend.It comes as Scotlandrsquos council leaders yesterday expressed disappointment that the agreed Budget deal only makes good the underfunding of new and existing commitments required by the Scottish Government and does nothing to address inflationary or demand pressures.It also fails to make any restoration of the signicant cuts to Local Government core funding in previous years.Leaders agreed that, as such, the settlement represents a  per cent or poundmillion cut in real terms in revenue funding for Local Government.Council Leaders instructed the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities to continue to lobby strongly for the additional % funding for inflationary pressures and % for restoration of previous funding cuts and for restoration of the poundm cut to the capital allocation.Mr Kerley said: ldquoThere clearly comes a point where councils have to say, as they have been saying for years, some of them, lsquowe canrsquot keep trimming a bit off here and a bit off there, and turning the lights off earlierrsquo and stuff like that.ldquoIn the longer term, you canrsquot provide for increased public services without increasing the flow of money into that ndash whether thatrsquos through taxation or charging, and wersquove generally resisted charging of ious kinds, though everywhere you look where councils are enabled to charge they are increasing the charges they are putting on things.ldquoAnd they are testing out, with for example musical tuition, whether they can charge for that. I think thatrsquos going to be an interesting test of legal commitment and legal powers and legal authority when it ndash as I think it will ndash goes into court in some shape or form.Mr Kerley said local authorities charging for services has always been ldquoa bit of a tangle, adding: ldquoWe charge for some things and we donrsquot charge for others. Some of them are statutorily protected in terms of charging. You canrsquot charge for lending library books,but you can charge for the lateof library books.ldquoYou charge for theatres, you charge for going into a swimming pool ndash how much you charge is a matter of what you need to raise and what you think people will pay.He said reforming council tax is ldquoone possibility, but added the ldquobig challenge for any government is the notion that you can, through a local property tax and indeed through income tax, make all of this additional money up through just affecting wealthy people or rich people...[it] just doesnrsquot hold.Councils argue funding provided by the Scottish Government is often ringfenced, funnelling extra cash directly into areas chosen by ministers, such as the expansion of free childcare.But Mr Kerley said the degree of ring-fencing ldquois considerably less than it was  or  years ago.He said: ldquoItrsquos reduced, but itrsquos now creeping back up again ndash I think most obviously with nursery education, because the huge commitment to, in a sense double, the amount of nursery education available for three and fouryear-olds meant councils had to create often purpose-built facilities or improve the ones they had, increase staffing and so on.

Deer numbers on the estate, part of Caenlochan Glen, increased by % between  and  from , to ,.The Scottish Government says deer population control in Scotland is a major issue, because the animals destroy forests that are needed in the fight against climate change, as are peatlandrsquos, which the deer can disturb.They are also estimated to cause , road accidents every year in Scotland. Earlier this year, a report ordered by the Scottish Government recommended thousands more deer be culled annually across the country to address the issue.Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland, the countryrsquos association representing hillwalkers, said: ldquoWe have major problems in Scotland with too many deer and the effect itrsquos having on the natural habitat.ldquoI think Caenlochan is the worst area for deer in Scotland and Balmoral is part of the problem.ldquoItrsquos time the Royal Family,they are serious about climate change, start reducing numbers of deer.Robbie Kernahan, director at Scottish Natural Heritage said: ldquoThe estates in the South Grampian and Caenlochan area, including Balmoral, have been working with SNH to reduce deer numbers.A SNH spokesman added: ldquoOur recent Deer Progress Report showed that while challenges remain, signicant progress has been made by landowners and managers.ldquoSNH leads a programme of work to promote sustainable deer management across Scotland, recognising the essential role it needs to play to help address climate change and bioersity loss.ldquoResearch shows deer numbers increased in Scotland from  to , but numbers have since stabilised because of increased culling, which is sometimes necessary to ensure healthy deer populations, reduce road traffic accidents and prevent signicant damage to our agriculture, forestry and nature.A Balmoral source said: ldquoRed deer are an iconic addition to Balmoral but there can be a clear conflict between deer culling and ensuring local forests are maintained around the estate.ldquoThe estate is doing itrsquos very best to ensure a balance is maintained and is working with relevant authorities to ensure this is achieved.A recent report has said up to one million wild deer, nearly double previous estimates, could be roaming the country, damaging the landscape and hampering environmental efforts.The findings, published by the Deer Working Group, is urging Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control deer numbers to protect their lucrative hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls.But landowners have criticised the recommendations, saying the report comes in sharp contrast to similar research by Scottish Natural Heritage published just two months earlier.The body that represents rural businesses and landowners, Scottish Land and Estates , also insisted conflicting evidence on the future of deer management in Scotland should not overshadow the recent progress achieved.It maintained the issue was not about overall deer numbers but about their impact on local areas.Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of the SLE, said: ldquoSubstantial progress has been made in the operation of deer management groups over the past five years, with the sector demonstrating its ability to respond and adapt to new challenges and manage deer in a way that is sustainable and safeguards public interests.\"Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay, Perthshire, have red deer densities above  per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between  and  per square kilometre. The report endorses SNHrsquos identication of the need for signicant changes in deer management as an important issue in climate crisis mitigation measures, and recommends that it is addressed as a priority. Conservationists argue that red deer, who often roam in vast herds, prevent woodland and shrubs from naturally regenerating.Ms Laing added: ldquoThe right density is also dependent on pasture availability rather than a strict number applicable across every region."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-large-inside-glasgows-anarchic-school-art","story":"Sometimes the tools required are more specic.

If therersquos a box lying around some place, these guys want to think outside of it. On a matter of principle.In that context the chattering plastic teeth make a lot of sense. They are art.

But when an artist spots that self-same trinket, he or she starts to count the possibilities. And there are many. Those rattling teeth become a metaphor for the rictus grin of our dying society.

They are a textbook, a laptop and a bunch of notepads, all rolled into one.Get creativeIt isnrsquot only the set of joke shop chompers that prove to be out of the ordinary on my tour of the Art School. Therersquos also some sort of metal, car-like machine that has been welded together from what seems to be rusty fragments of scrap iron. Elsewhere, a student has hung up a painted sign on which is scrawled the statement: lsquoMy worldrsquos on fire. How about yours rsquoPainted images paper the walls. Some are pretty striking.One image is a close-up view of flayed flesh. The kind of thing I imagine Hannibal Lecter might sketch in his spare time, in between snacking on human hotpot.Therersquos plenty more way-out and wacky work on display. Which is all to the good, as far as Irsquom concerned. If you canrsquot breach boundaries and tickle taboos when yoursquore a young, ambitious artist, when  can you do so  I actually feel very privileged to be strolling through the open minds of some seriously creative students. To grab a ringside seat as they blossom into badass. The Glasgow School of Art has a legendary alumni, after all. Robbie Coltrane. Muriel Gray. Fran Healy. Peter Capaldi. Some of them, just to be perverse, even become artists. My guides for the tour are Martha Stefani-Bose and Maja Tacchi, both in their third year at Glasgow School of Art, where they are also student ambassadors. Each Friday they take a group of prospective students round campus, to show them the delights contained within these walls of wit and way-out wonder. Members of the public arenrsquot invited on these guided tours, though Irsquove managed to sneak along using my Access All Areas Scotland Pass. Actually, I donrsquot really have such a pass. Irsquom just a pushy journo who manages to go places Irsquom not invited. One of the genuine would-be students on the tour is Sandra McWilliams, who was previously a successful accountant. She even had her own business for  years, but ultimately found it less than fulfilling. So she decided to get creative with her le.ldquoMy husband said to me, why donrsquot you seeyou can do something with art, she explains. ldquoSo I went to Clyde College to seethere was anything they could offer.Sandra was already adept at embroidery, crochet and knitting, which allowed her to be accepted for an HND in textiles. Now she wants to take the next step in her creative journey and is hoping to be offered a place at Glasgow School of Art, starting next year. ldquoMy eldest daughter came here to do a media course, she says. ldquoAnd I felt it was such a lovely community. I was always at home when I visited. I thought it was such a small and intimate setting.The tour has changed Sandrarsquos opinion, regarding the size of the school. ldquoItrsquos much bigger than I thought, she marvels. ldquoIt really is quite a layout.Ping pong tableIt is, indeed. People with only a passing knowledge of the school probably assume itrsquos essentially the ill-fated Mackintosh building, with a few minor buildings surrounding it. Not so.The Reid Building, for instance, which was completed in  and stands opposite the Mackintosh, is where our tour begins. It is a large, multi-floored, modernistic space, open plan and awash with light. Various disciplines are studied here, including textiles and printing. In many ways it could be any further education building. It has a canteen, rows of desks, computers. There are a few more unusual elements, however. Looms for the textile students to work on. And a print room that contains numerous shelves of small metal blocks with raised letters. Such things were once used by typesetters in newspaper offices, before digital technology replaced them. It seems that this archaic way of forming words still retains its appeal with the creatives of tomorrow.Painting and fine art is studied in a building that was formerly Stow College. Although this is the place for creativity with few boundariesitrsquos actually a rather brutalist environment. The corridors, grim and grey-walled, have the sort of chill feel that would be familiar to anyone who has visited an ancient swimming baths. At a push, I could be strolling down an endless passageway in KGB headquarters, circa  something-or-other, waiting nervously for a bullet from behind to finish me off. But then I peek into the artistsrsquo studios, and Irsquom hypnotised by a technicolour trance of anarchy turned into artice.No hierarchyI also visit the school of architecture, where everything is symmetrical, systematic and very well organised, as you would expect. Therersquos also a ping pong table, which you would not expect.Of course our group doesnrsquot get to visit the Mackintosh building, which was almost destroyed by fires in  and . An extensive restoration programme is still being attempted, and the entire edice is cloaked in a porcupine like framework of scaffolding. Itrsquos almost impossible to see what lurks beneath.ldquoThere could be a giant inflatable bouncy castle under there, for all anyone knows, I say to one of the guides, Martha Stefani-Bose, who was brought up in the west end of Glasgow and is studying painting and printmaking. ldquoNow that would be an artistic statement, she says drily.On a more serious note she adds: ldquoEveryone is mourning the loss of that amazing building. Obviously it was a work of art itself. But space-wise wersquore actually doing fine. It doesnrsquot seem cramped at all, and the new arrangements allow us to work even closer together, which really helps with the collaborative process.This collaborative process is one of the key selling points of Glasgow School of Art. ldquoTherersquos no hierarchy between disciplines, says Maja Tacchi, who is from Bristol and studies architecture.ldquoItrsquos an incredibly unique environment and wersquore lucky to be here. People from all dferent courses pull together and use their dferent areas of expertise to create new and interesting work. The art school really is a community of like-minded souls. It doesnrsquot matter what year yoursquore in, how old you are, where yoursquore from, or what yoursquore studying.

But that is more acceptable for it has a known pathway and inoculations are on offer to all.Coronavirus is the unknown that strikes not just the already compromised and the elderly but, it seems, young men in particular.While our TV and papers have been pretty restrained, we have seen the scenes in Italy and, of course, China with its sealed off small towns and villages and one sees the enormity of what could happen.I have no doubt that in a deteriorating situation my farming neighbours would take up gun and barricades to keep all out and in.And no doubt too that, as history shows, the city dwellers barely an hour away, would seek the purity of our air and the remoteness of our houses, far from crowds and contamination.Should the two meet...But then I shake myself for having such melodramatic thoughts and remind myself that although it may often seem like it, wersquore not living in a dystopian world and evenwe were, the good guys always win in the end, donrsquot they Perhaps not, for they havenrsquot done much winning the last few years and maybe such thoughts are actually sound and wise. Always have a plan B.Actually, I no longer have a plan B. With my compromised lungs Irsquod be a goner from the start. In that event the army of dispossessed from Toulouse can feel free to make merry with my house and land for as long as they can.I would hope to retain my thin veneer until the end.

It was utterly nuts. But the best thing about it was how calmly and rationally Yorkshire Tea reacted on Twitter.I donrsquot do Twitter because itrsquos full of fatheads. And itrsquos an absolute minefield for offence, uber-sensitivity, inflated self-importance and saying the wrong thing. Hey, it sounds just like a newspaper column!A lot of PR folk, notably those on woke extremist police forces up and down the country, are making a right bags of things on Twitter, with people stealing the wheels off their patrol cars as they sit in the office tweeting about how ldquoprogressive they are.But Yorkshire Tea got it right. After initially being stunned at the accusations of guilt by vanishingly distant association, they tried to explain that Mr Sunakrsquos tweet was nothing to do with them and that they would never ldquointentionally stick ourselves in a Twitter storm, particularly late in the day when it was ldquonearly hometime.They also pointed out that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had posed similarly with their teabags in . To no avail.The increasingly deranged cyber-bullies still piled on, screaming ldquoshame on you and calling for the company to be destroyed.Baffled, the tea jennies tried to understand what was happening, and tweeted: ldquoWersquove spent the last three days answering furious accusations and boycott calls. For some, our tea just being drunk by someone they donrsquot like means itrsquos forever tainted hellipAnd: ldquoItrsquos been pretty shocking to see the determination some have had to drag us into a political mud-fight. But itrsquos been lovely to see others speak up for us hellipThat is indeed what happened, and itrsquos the beauty of Twitter that decent ratepayers can also have their say and fight back against the bullies.Even when one of the latter still went shrilly on, the company advised: ldquoSue, yoursquore shouting at tea. Please do look after yourself and try to be kind to others.Of course, you canrsquot talk any sense into such folk. The golden rule when dealing with the woke is: Never apologise, never explain. Itrsquos never enough.The aforementioned Sue went on shrieking, until Yorkshire Tea pleaded: ldquoFrom one human being to another, would [it] be OK for you to stop now  And, in so doing, it won the sympathy of everyone with an ounce of common sense.But you do wonder about what is going on inside the heads of the Sues and suchlike, whose purpose in le seems to be to persecute.There must be a shred of decency in there somewhere and, like the Spanish Inquisition, Stalinrsquos Cheka and the witch-burners of old, they must have convinced themselves that they have right on their side.But their perspective has become skewed. In the guise of liberalism they are bringing, as Orwell predicted, totalitarianism. However, it was always a weakness in Orwellrsquos writings that he could never foresee the crucial role that teabags would play in the fight for liberty.Right, time to put the kettle on.++++I GET severely discombobulated when I read about top civil servants, Treasury advisers and even Tory MPs saying they listen to hard rock. Itrsquos not natural.Hard rock is for people with long hair and tight trousers, like me back in the days when I was full of hope. True, my hair is shorter and my trousers baggier now, but Irsquom still a free spirit fighting the Man. These other people: they are the Man.The latest Establishment figure revealed to love rock is David Frost, , Boris Johnsonrsquos Europe adviser. Previously, he spent  years in the Foreign  Commonwealth Office. In , he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. Hersquos pictured in a suit and tie.And yet he says hersquos a fan of Motorhead and Led Zeppelin. Itrsquos disgraceful for a man in such a position. Could you imagine Sir Humphrey Appleby or Sir Harold Macmillan banging their heads rhythmically to Rush Call me prejudiced, but I believe record store owners should have told Mr Frost: ldquoIrsquom sorry, sir, but this isnrsquot for the likes of you. Try up the road, where theyrsquove got some Mantovani and Brahms.++++LIKE many sad outcasts, I was delighted to read about the cast of Friends reuniting for a one-off show. And my happiness could barely be contained when I read they were being paid between .M and .M to appear.Itrsquos wonderful that artists are rewarded adequately for their hard work. Irsquom a big fan of the show, eventhe charactersrsquo flat arrangements never made realistic sense. At least two of the buddies were well-paid professionals.Itrsquos the same with that show about top physicists sharing a flat. They get on each otherrsquos wicks, but obviously thatrsquos preferable to buying a place of your own with your fat salary.Oddly enough, American sitcoms used to present the opposite scenario, with binmen and sales assistants living in huge detached houses: showcasing the American Way.Still, we could all identy with the nice young people in Friends. The show is still a top pick among young persons on yon Netflix, who envy the charactersrsquo cosy togetherness. The fact that the actors were paid M an episode provides an added warm glow.++++DONALD Trump doesnrsquot eat healthily like Scottish people do. The US president is famously carnivorous, loving well-done steaks, burgers and meatloaf. If undertaking a state visit to Greggs, itrsquos unlikely hersquod try the famous vegan sausage roll.A White House source told CNN prior to a trip to India this week: ldquoI have never seen him eat a vegetable.That made the Indian trip problematic, since his host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, like most of the country, is ardently vegetarian. Monsieur Modi tried to interest the animal-masticating loon in veggie stuff, hiring a top chef to cook special samosas with, er, broccoli in them. Donald didnrsquot bite.His schtick seems to have been to attend the state dinners, eat nothing, then waddle rapidly back to his hotel, where a private chef expertly singed a steak for him.Earlier this week, the Trumplingrsquos former physician revealed how he used to smuggle caullower into the presidentrsquos mashed potato.

All education would be fee-paying, of course, with the most successful schools free to charge exorbitantly for their services.School departments might be sponsored by firms specialising in the appropriate disciplines. Thus, the science department with its partners Evonik, Pfizer and Biogen would be pleased to offer a suite of subjects tailored to meet the demands of a changing world. Maths would be brought to you by Tesla Inc and foreign languages would be the preserve of international airlines and holiday firms. English could be sponsored by Penguin, Harper Collins or Bloomsbury. Obviously, these firms would expect teachers to ensure their contracted authors featured heavily in their reading lists.Further down the scale, local firms might be invited to tender for subjects in those schools unable to compete financially with the elite FTSE establishments. These would be solid enough performers and might get your child into a half-decent polytechnic and a career as an army specialist.As well as league tables for exam results there would be something similar for teachers. This would operate like the draft system for US gridiron stars. Top schools would be prepared to pay huge salaries for teachers who can spin an A from a C- with the densest of materials.:Opinion Matrix: Power battles and realities of societyIn terms of discipline, parents would be expected to sign a sort of educational pre-nup. This would effectively permit a school to discipline a child as they saw fit and indemny teachers in the event of any physical or mental damage sustained by the child.As with all pure market-driven industries the dross would be quietly discarded. Children whose parents were unable to afford even the most basic fees would be taken to educational lsquofarmsrsquo where they would be given basic instruction on physical fitness and mechanical and household maintenance. Each year in these places there would be a Hunger Games type of competition where the prize could be a free education at one of the top schools. Those firms with an authentic sense of social mission at their core would bestow scholarships for the children of factory workers with long and unblemished service records.The overall effect achieved by such a system would be to ensure that power and wealth was retained within tight clusters of the right sort. Sounds ridiculous Well, in effect, itrsquos how Britainrsquos independent and fee-paying school system works. The essential alchemy at the heart of these places has little to do with achieving academic excellence and instilling lofty values. Bright pupils excelling at a fee-paying school would also have done so at a state establishment.Letrsquos be honest here their main attraction lies in masking the intellectual weaknesses of the less able offspring of rich families, thus sparing them having to work with common people who donrsquot just wear overalls for fishing. It also explains many of the catastrophic events in British military history some decisions taken in the run-up to the banking crisis and the tenure of the Bush family and Donald Trump in the White House.The results of a survey published this week found that more than a third of Edinburgh residents felt that a childrsquos social class had a material effect on their academic school performances. This compared with just % in Glasgow. The numbers are hardly surprising when you factor in how many children attend fee-paying schools in Edinburgh: currently around one in five and the highest percentage of such in the UK.:Herald Society heroes honoured for their work helping othersIrsquom not entirely sure that this suggests Edinburgh people are more class-conscious than in Glasgow or somehow more snobbish in their attitudes. Itrsquos simply confirmation of what most of us probably already knew: thatyou want to gain influence and wealth in modern Britain it helps greatlyyou attended one of these schools. It would be instructiveMy Tutor, the online tutoring service which conducted the survey, undertook also to ask people to what extent they felt that a childrsquos natural ability affected academic performance. Perhaps this is too dficult to measure.It certainly seems beyond the wit of any British or Scottish Government to attempt to do so. As things stand we assume that children born into challenging social circumstances must be of low academic ability. We judge them purely on exam results and fail to factor in the daily challenges of health inequality and multi-deprivation. We know that none can afford private tuition, the favourite means by which affluent but academically unremarkable children can tilt the playing field. The failure of British society to find more imaginative ways of unlocking the potential of poor children must cost this country billions every year in health and social security spending and crime prevention.Perhaps then they could borrow on the notion of pure, market-driven schools and customise them to meet the needs of the many rather than the few. Irsquod grant major global firms as well as local companies a suite of incentives to provide direct funding of local authority schools in our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. They would have no influence on educational policy. As part of the deal they would also provide employment opportunities for pupils in these schools.Funding could range from meeting the salaries of extra teachers providing resource materials and paying for overseas trips. They would meet the cost of tutors for bright children and grant them meaningful internships, currently the exclusive preserve of affluent pupils whose parents have good professional connections.Boris Johnson talked about a process of ldquolevelling up to address regional inequalities in British society. I expect that to go the same way as Margaret Thatcherrsquos promise to bestow Franciscan kindness in .

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus aer lingus confirms passenger travelled on airline from italy to dublin","story":"Dr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  Kevin Scott   Belfast FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Adrian Mairs , Dr Philip Veal , Dr Michael McBride and Mariam McCarthyprovide an update on Coronavirus on February th  February   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAer Lingus has confirmed that the person from Northern Ireland infected with the coronvirus travelled on the airline to Dublin airport from Italy. The news comes as passengers sitting close to the woman infected with Northern Ireland#s first coronavirus case have been contacted by health officials.Aer Lingus cabin crew who worked on the flight are in self isolation for  days.RTE reported the aircraft involved was not used for  hours after it ed to Dublin and that the flight crew, maintenance and cleaning staff that were in contact with the the aircraft don#t need to take any action.Aer Lingus says the self isolation is a precautionary measure but that it is a stressful time for those involved and their families.It said it wouldn#t be releasing the flight details to protect the identities of those involved and said messages of support could be sent internally.On Thursday evening authorities were put on high alert after the Public Health Agencyconfirmed the first case had been detected in Northern Ireland. The affected woman had flown from northern Italy, where there have been a number of deaths due to the illness, to Dublin Airport before travelling to Northern Ireland.Health and Safety Executiveofficials in the Republic worked overnight on Thursday to identy those who were on board the flight.It has been reported the woman travelled to Dublin#s Connolly Street station by bus before travelling to Northern Ireland by train. Have you been contacted by health officials about the coronavirus in Northern Ireland  Contact us at digital.editorial@belfasttelegraphNorthern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann said  tests have so far been completed here, with one presumed to be positive.He said he was reassured that the planning of the past four to five weeks, maybe even longer, at a UK level and dealing with counterparts in the Republic of Ireland had been effective.He added: In response, our health service and our health systems can actually step up.I am reassured that the professionals we have in the health system are well-placed to cope with the eventuality that may come.He said he had always maintained from the start that it was a matter of when, not , there was a positive case in Northern Ireland.Unfortunately that proved to be right last night but in how our system reacted I was pretty assured that we have the best people to deal with this, he said. He said tracing those who may have had contact with the patient was at an advanced stage and would soon be completed.I have been reassured in the Public Health Agencytoday that anyone who was at high-risk and may have been in contact with the inidual, last night has been contacted.Members of the public who have travelled between Dublin and Belfast using public transport need not be concerned Dr Jillian JohnstonDr Jillian Johnston, consultant in health protection at the PHA, said: “All stages of the inidual’s journey were identied and those who came into closest contact have been traced and contacted with public health advice and guidance.“I would emphasise that members of the public who have travelled between Dublin and Belfast using public transport need not be concerned.“Contact tracing is an effective and efficient method carried out by the PHA to help prevent the further spread of infections such as COVID-.Dr Johnston said that once a patient tests positive for an infectious disease and interview is carried out with the patient to help identy those who they may have come into closest contact with. “Once contact has been made, the appropriate advice can be given to these iniduals based on whether they are at high risk, low risk or there is no risk, she said. “Regular contact is kept with those in the higher risk categories andthey experience any symptoms, appropriate medical intervention will take place.If there is any links to another country the PHA will work with counterparts to enable investigations into potential contacts and actions to be undertaken. In a statement Translink said the PHA has completed the contact tracing process and that Translink is taking precautions to prevent the spread of the virus on its fleet. We already regularly undertake deep cleaning of our fleet and have cleaning regimes in place which include keeping surfaces clean and sanitising hand touch areas, the spokesman added. This has included additional cleaning of all Enterprise train carriages by both ourselves and Irish Rail as a further preventative measure. We have also issued guidance to all staff on the latest advice to maintain good hand hygiene practices.“PHA has advised that there is a relatively low level of risk to anyone who travels on public transport and while staff and crew in contact with the general public are not considered to be at a heightened risk of contracting COVID- as a result of their work, we continue to recommend that all staff and passengers adhere to the Public Health guidelines to help prevent the spread of germs”.Worldwide, , people have been infected with the virus.

The company said it is currently out of stock of surgical face masks in stores and online. We are aware that there is a high demand from customers to purchase face masks.It added: We have also seen an increase in sales of hand sanitisers but we still have stock available in our warehouses for stores and online. Supply is being affected by the fact that many suppliers source the product in China, which is limiting exports, according to one industry figure.Ian Brennan of cleaning and hygiene suppliers Brennan Hygiene said the supply chain to businesses is slowing down.The situation is the supply chain is slowly grinding to a halt, said Mr Brennan, managing director of the Carrickfergus-based company. Deb Products is one of our main suppliers and they are currently three to four weeks behind all orders.One of the problems with the supply chain is that many factories producing the face masks, hand sanitisers and other related products are based in China, Mr Brennan noted.He added that the Chinese government has ordered % of all volume remain in the country.Mr Brennan said he has heard other bigger companies in his field have extremely large back orders in place.

Workforce imbalances in large organisations and big companies can result from a iety of often complex factors which cannot be over looked or simply dismissed.Reducing an analysis of sectarian practice to a numbers game sheds no light and serves little purpose. So too with equating every adverse decision to a sectarian motive or using the accusation of sectarianism to address every ill.Mr Scullion added: There are a number of immediate steps which could and should be taken to starts to process of eradicating sectarianism from our society. An integrated and secular education system, a Bill of Rights , an integrated housing programme and the criminalisation of sectarianism would be a good start.However, for as long as institutionalised sectarianism forms the basis of government structures and practices, there will be no political leadership from Stormont and no pressure to address either sectarianism or the vested interests which help perpetuate it.

It was a comfortable win for Eamon Donnelly’s boys and in truth they could have won by a bigger marginnot for the heroics of young Ciaran Sharvin in the Strangford goal. Harps started the game brightly with the wind at their backs pressing for the opening goal. The elements had a big impact on this game and Jack Mc Laughlin would have scored directly from a corner but for a fine headed clearance by Strangford’s Cole Mc Gouron. Harps continued on the front foot and Glenn Mc Court split the Strangford defence with a clever pass that found Oran Carlin cutting in from the right but the lively Kiefer Mc Cusker just failed to get a touch to Carlin’s brilliant cross as it flashed across the Strangford goal. Harps continued to press and the opening goal came after some good work by Oisin O’Donnell who played a sublime pass into the path of the onrushing Caolan O’Donnell. O’Donnell did well to hold off his marker and arrow his shot into the bottom right hand corner of the goal to put Harps - up. googletag.cmd.push PowerfulMc Cusker almost added a second minutes later but his powerful strike from the edge of the box was deflected over by Strangford defender, Odhran McKenna. Harps kept this lead until the interval and came out in the second half to try and put the game beyond Strangford’s reach. Luke and Glenn Mc Court were beginning to take control of the midfield and it was Luke’s chipped pass that sent Jack Fleming in on goal. His first time shot could only be parried by Sharvin but that man Caolan O’ Donnell was on hand once again to sweep the ball into the Strangford net to put Harps two in front. Minutes later Fleming thought he had added a third when he slid home Noah Leonard’s cross only for the referee to chalk it off for offside. Strangford continued to work hard and seek a way back into the tie but thanks to the outstanding defending of Ollie Deery and Shay Campbell they rarely threatened John Campbell in the Harp’s goal. The closest they came was when the impressive Cillian Swail fired just over the bar. The boys in green finished well on top and and broke through the Strangford rearguard time after time. Leonard and Luke Mc Court both seeing fine strikes brilliantly saved by Sharvin. In the end Harps were happy to settle for the two goal victory to seal their place in the Quarter Finals. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But fast forward seven days, the picture was turned on its head completely thanks to an inspiring victory over Tullamore, who went into the game in third place in the table.Four tries, five points and a very fine performance changes the scope of the ision once again, and victory over Clonmel this week would really put Derry right back in the mix for a play-off spot at the more promising end of the ision. That  minutes against Tullamore could well be the turning point everyone at Judges Road was waiting for.“The all-round performance, especially in those conditions, was superb,” Richard McCarter said. “Playing with the wind in the first half you nearly put pressure on yourselves to build a lead, but we were composed and that’s what I loved about the performance from the first to last minute. “We have been waiting for that performance for a while and that has while it has been so frustrating for me, because I work with these guys week in and week out and I know how good they can be. The ceiling is so high for them in terms of potential and I’m just so happy that today we were able to show how good we can be. This is a stepping stone, we can be better and we have to now back it up.”Derry were beaten by Tullamore when the sides last met in November, but despite their loftier position in the table, Tullamore never look like damaging Derry on this occasion, with the hosts managing the game superbly to deny their opponents momentum of any kind. “We had a bit of an advantage at half time and to keep them out in the second half, from there, to not score at all, was a brilliant effort,” McCarter agreed.“Even with  or  minutes to go I didn’t really feel under threat that they were going to come back and score three tries against us. I thought we have lacked leaders at certain times this year, but we didn’t here Richie Baird, Corrsy, Big Hugh in the front row and Loguie and a lot of those backs put their hands up, the two centres did a lot of hard running and tackling so it’s hard to pick out any one player.” googletag.cmd.push ConfidenceMcCarter and Head Coach Paul O’Kane are now hoping that the confidence and belief gained from the victory over Tullamore can give them a foundation for the remainder of the season, five games which will decide Derry’s destiny for good or bad. One thing for certain is that Derry’s record away from home needs to improve. One win from six away games this season, a win against Bangor on November , is not ideal for a team hoping to make the play-offs, and McCarter agrees that consistency is keythey are to climb the table in the coming weeks. “Loads of encouragement and loads of confidence but we have to back it up next week,” he said. “It’s no use being delighted with our performance this week and then going down to Clonmel and getting stuffed. We have to bring that attitude, bring that concentrating for another  minutes and try and get a couple of back to back victories which we haven’t managed this year.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead. This advantage was quickly cancelled out by Gallagher, but Down continued to press and further scores from Liam Kerr and Barry OrsquoHagan sent the home side into the break with a - to - lead.Down controlled play at the start of the second half and points from OrsquoHare and Quinn stretched their lead to four points.However, no sooner had the Down supporters started to relax as their side moved well clear, when Longford roared back with - without reply to take a shock - to - lead.Connerton rocked the boat when he goaled out of nothing and when Dessie Reynolds and Gallaghertagged on points, the visitors were suddenly in the driving seat.Down now faced an uphill task, but they refused to panic and with  minutes gone Liam Kerr started the fightback with a point from play.Barry OrsquoHagan converted a free and it was suddenly all square again, but the predatory Quinn pounced to give Down a - to - lead with five minutes remaining with a well-worked goal.A free from Daniel Mimnagh another rsquo from Collum saw Longford trail by a single point with only a matter of minutes left on the clock.Down really went for broke at this stage and they were rewarded when James Guinness showed his versatility with a cool finish when he put the home side into an unassailable - to - lead with the  minutes almost up.Longford never stopped trying, but all they had to show for their efforts was another Mimnagh point.Down take to the road again this weekend when they head to OrsquoConnor Park to take on Offaly on Sunday afternoon for another must win game.Down: R Burns, S Annett, P Murdock, R McAleenan, G Collins, D OrsquoHagan , B McArdle, J Flynn , D Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , K McKernan , L KerrD OrsquoHare , A Morgan, C Quinn .

I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof.What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.“The project has been designed to be sustainable on many levels. The materials used are durable, traditional materials. The oak used for the roof is from a sustainable source.”The minister added:“Heritage forms a key component of our tourism economy.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

But in a ided society such as Northern Ireland, with history pointing to the clear potential for discrimination, recrimination and violence, it is more dficult still for those in favour of Irish unity to win the argument – even at a time when the old Protestant majority is vanishing.Although polling evidence is contradictory – with Belfast firm Lucid Talk’s polls consistently suggesting higher levels of support for Irish unity than most other polls – next week polling will be released which for several reasons will make grim reading for republicans.Even after all the turmoil of Brexit, of three years without devolved government, of the cash for ash scandal, of the distrusted Boris Johnson as prime minister, there is scant evidence of the sort of surge in support for Irish unity which would be necessary to win a border poll.This week a group of senior academics headed by The Constitution Unit at University College London but encompassing professors in Belfast, Dublin and the US came to Belfast to take evidence about how any future border poll would work.A separate academic team at another English university is working on another signicant project examining related questions.The very fact that more than  years after the Belfast Agreement basic questions around the practicalities of a border poll have not been resolved – or in many cases even asked – implicitly points to a failure of Sinn Féin.The party which has Irish reunication as its central goal and which now accepts that the only way that can happen is by winning a border poll has put far less energy into resolving how that could happen than it has into the sort of political disputes and manoeuvringwhich have brought it to electoral dominance within nationalism.Belatedly, republicans now appear to be adopting some of the tactics of Brexiteers ahead of the EU Referendum. Just as Brexiteers, realising that Ukip were toxic to many voters, set up surrogate organisations – from ‘Business for Britain’ to ‘Students for Britain’ – to carry their message to otherwise unreachable groups, soseveral republican groups which are not publicly linked to Sinn Féin have now sprung up.Those groups have been more effective than the party at stimulating debate and encouraging some unionists to engage in that debate.Nevertheless, even those groups have made limited progress in persuading those who do not instinctively want a united Ireland – or a ‘new Ireland’, as it is now branded – of the imperative for that to happen.While the Secretary of State retains a discretionary power to call a border poll at any time the mandatory trigger for him to have to call a referendum remains opaque.\u2028The  Agreement states that“ at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the UK”, then he must call a referendum.The Agreement is not prescriptive on the criteria to be taken into account when deciding on the issue.Five weeks before the Brexit vote I hypothetically asked the then Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, whether she would take an overall majority for nationalism at Stormont or opinion polls as an indication of support for a united Ireland. She said vaguely that the NIO would consider “all the relevant facts”.If such a poll was called, it is unclear what roles the British and Irish governments would or could play. Some people believe both governments should be neutral.But how could the Irish government be neutral when it is not only constitutionally obliged to support Irish unity, but would also be the only body which could make credible promises to voters as to what a vote for unity would entail Central to any successfulIrish unity campaign would almost certainly be a clear plan – or at least a sufficiently convincing one – as to what would happen after such a vote.An agreed plan – akin to the Scottish government’s document prior to the  independence referendum –would make it harder for unionism to make the argument that, as with Brexit, people would be voting to end the current constitutional clarity and enter a period of uncertainty. Some republicans believe that unionists will come on board to discuss what should be in that proposal.While there will be exceptions who prove the rule, there is little evidence of unionists willing to assist with such a process – as distinct from taking part in discussions where they argue the unionist case.In fact, it would be profoundly illogical for unionists to help with something which would make the end of the Union easier – unless they believed that they would inevitably lose such a plebiscite, which is not a commonly held view.Unionists working on a plan to build a united Ireland would be the equivalent of republicans working on a plan to make the Union more attractive – it would be antithetical to their ideological interests.Any signicant body of unionists being involved in such a process only seems realisticthey have lost a border poll, meaning that until that point the onus is on nationalists to present an attractive proposition which will persuade voters.As a Sinn Féin member this week admitted, with unusual candour, to the BBC, the sort of ‘up the Ra’ comments and other triumphalist episodes which marked Sinn Féin’s recent southern electoral success do nothing to persuade unionists that they are serious about the ‘new Ireland’ rhetoric.Some people believe that ‘citizens’ assemblies’ – a trendy attempt to circumvent seemingly intractable political problems – could bring ordinary unionists on board eventheir leaders refused.But aside from the dficulties of such a process being infected by either conscious or unconsciousbias, the legitimacy of citizens’ assemblies rests on the argument of their proponents that those selected to sit on them are chosen randomly, making them at least quasi-democratic.If ordinary unionists refused to participate, such bodies would not be remotely representative.Thus far there is signicant reason to believethat the scale of change is less decisive that eitherthose unionists who despair the Union is over would fear or those nationalists who believe Irish unity is inevitable now hope to be the case.What happens next will be shaped by the decisions of those who lead unionism and nationalism, as well as by global social and economic forces far beyond their control.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

On February , , her then boyfriend of two years David sat down at home to watch the TV coverage of his beloved Northern Ireland play at their home ground of Windsor Park.What happened at half time was certainly something he wasn’t expecting. For there, right in the middle of the pitch, cheered on by delighted fans, was Lisa, standing with a huge banner which spelled out the six words that were to change his le forever: David Houston, will you marry me Joanne Palmer and her husband IanThankfully David said yes and the pair, who live in Claudy, tied the knot in October , a year and a half after the Leap Day proposal. Eight years on, Lisa, , and David, , are as happy as ever and now the proud parents of three sons, George, , Elliot, , and Henry, . Lisa, who works in a nursing home in Omagh, said the idea of taking matrimonial matters into her own hands was quite a random one.“David’s friends had tickets to a Northern Ireland game, but he said he couldn’t be bothered going, so I said I’d like to go as I had never been to a football match.“I asked him what date it was on, and when he said February , I said, are you sure you want me to go ’ But he was so busy watching the Super Sunday game that he didn’t even take me on.”Lisa then got in touch with the Irish Football Association to seethey would allow her to ask Sky TV to point their cameras at her during the match so she could hold up her proposal. But Sky told her that she would need to actually come on to the pitch. The first half of the match passed without a single goal, which didn’t help Lisa’s nerves. Then, when the whistle blew, she made her way onto the pitch, helped by a couple of David’s friends, and unveiled the five foot banner, which she had ordered online, proclaiming the question of all questions.“It was the longest five minutes of my le waiting for the phone to ring to hear a yes, ” she recalled..“Finally he rang and said, what are you at ’, and I said, well ’. He said yes, and I shouted his answer to the crowd and got a massive cheer. It was hilarious.’’Looking back on that momentous day, Lisa admitted she doesn’t knowshe would have the guts to do it now. ‘‘David and me talk about it sometimes and I thinkI was to do it now, I’d be more nervous. But David would say that he is still chuffed to bits to this day that I did it - it was a brave thing to do and it was a nice thing that happened to him.’’And he even received a signed Northern Ireland shirt as a result of his then girlfriend’s plucky proposal.Lisa’s advice to other women contemplating the big question today is simple - ‘go for it’. ‘‘If you’ve found the person you want to spend the rest of your le with, it doesn’t really matter who asks who. Andyou don’t you’ll have to wait another four years.’’The tradition of women proposing on leap day is thought to date back to th-century Ireland when St Bridget complained to St Patrick that women had to wait too long for suitors to propose.He then gave women a single day in a leap year to pop the question - the last day of the shortest month.Legend has it that Brigid then dropped to a knee and proposed to Patrick that instant, but he refused, kissing her on the cheek and offering a silk gown to soften the blow.Others believe the tradition originates from Scotland when Queen Margaret, then aged just five, declared in  that a woman could propose to any man she liked on February .Another woman who decided to do the asking was Joanne Palmer, , from Ballykelly, Co Londonderry.In  Joanne was working at Butlins in Minehead, Somerset. A week into her job as deputy manager of the nursery, the then -year-old met Ian, , who was on holidays at the resort with his friends. Joanne recalled: ‘‘We were in one of the nightclubs in Butlins and his friend was trying to chat me up, but I kept looking at Ian and he kept looking at me. The next night after that we met and got chatting ourselves. So, it was a holiday romance at the beginning.’’After Ian ed home to Cornwall, the lovestruck pair maintained their romance writing letters to each other and chatting on the phone. A year later Ian also got a job at Butlins and that, said Joanne, was when they ‘‘started getting serious’’ about each other. Joanne was ‘‘madly in love’’ with ‘‘tall, blonde’’ Ian and decided she wanted to marry him. ‘‘I think we both knew that we were going to be together, It just felt right.‘‘I remember reading Leap Year Day was the day women could propose and I have to say that he was the nearest thing to perfect that I had ever met.’’Butlins had closed for February, but the lovebirds stayed on, Joanne working as a chalet maid and Ian doing security. Joanne, a self-confessed terrible cook, decided to sweeten the proposal by baking a cake on her ‘wee two-ring cooker’’ in her room. She added: ‘‘I had bought a ring in Minehead that cost £, just so that I could put it onhe said yes.’’Prior to the big question, Joanne admits she felt anxious. ‘‘I am quite a confident person, but I was really, really nervous that day.‘‘He came in and sat down and I got down on one knee and I said ‘Ian, will you marry me ’ and I lted out the cake and he said ‘you, didn’t bake that’ and then he said ‘yes’.A few months later the pair came back to Northern Ireland for a holiday,‘‘Ian said he wanted topropose to me, but he wanted to do things right,’’ said Joanne, ‘‘so he took my dad to one side and asked himhe could have permission to marry his daughter. Really old-fashioned. And then in front of all my cousins and aunts and uncles, he proposed then.’’Ian and Joanne got married on January , , now have two children, Bradley, , and Abigail, , and have just celebrated our th wedding anniversary.Joanne said: ‘‘Every leap year day I wonder who  is doing it.’’Her advice to other women contemplating a proposal is this: ‘‘If you are going to do it, it has to be that person who is dferent than anybody  you have ever met, you have to have that feeling that this is the person you want to spend the rest of your le with. It’s very serious. I think people take marriage too lightly these days. ‘‘Before I met Ian I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritisand when I first met him I was absolutely fine, but just before we got married it got a lot worse. I went through a lot and he stood by me. He’s a hard-worker. He’s a good man. ‘‘We’ll be together  years in June. I don’t think I could imagine spending that time with anybody .’’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Veteransrsquo choirs also provide opportunities in music to a whole new range of people.In another Westminster debate on fire risk in flats and shared housing, I raised the concerns of many constituents relating to building defects, fire safety issues and other matters. I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings. We should be working on this on a UK-wide basis.I also secured my own debate on incineration of industrial and commercial waste. Irsquom supporting campaigners in the east of Cardf who oppose a planned new incinerator and have concerns over emissions and the impact of HGVs near schools and homes.With an existing incinerator near Cardf Bay, and continuing controversy over the biomass plant in Barry docks in our neighbouring constituency, this is an area of concern for many people locally. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When askedthey supported the construction of a dam,  per cent said they did not.The same number advocated for ldquonature friendly solutions to flood management.Local engineer David Bacon proposed pumping water from the lower end of the Cadoxton, where the flood risk is highest, onto the Sully Moors.Andrew Peterken, a Dinas Powys resident whose property is at risk of flooding, argued that natural flood management solutions should be trialled and the situation reviewed at a later date.The public have been invited by Natural Resources Wales to offer their feedback on the Outline Business Case until Friday, March .For more information, visit: naturalresources.wales about-us our-projects flood-scheme-projects dinas-powys-flood-scheme appraisal-of-dinas-powys-flood-scheme-options  langen. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
