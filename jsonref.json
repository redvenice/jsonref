The girls were so heavy.\u0027Just as they were about to open an emergency fire exit a firefighter screamed at them to stop because that side of the building above was on fire. Ms Mekonnen couldn\u0027t even finish her sentence as she wonders aloud: \u0027If he hadn\u0027t… I can\u0027t believe we are alive.\u0027Ms Mahmud\u0027s husband Mohammed has admitted he often \u0027thinks back\u0027 to that night when it took them all about 15 minutes to get to the bottom floor with his elderly father, telling GetWestLondon: \u0027I thank God we got out early and we made it.\u0027He revealed that his wife\u0027s best friend and his children\u0027s friends passed away, as well as his friend\u0027s mother.He said of his friend: \u0027Me and him, we had both been in the tower since birth.\u0027He told how all their closest friends were there and how he \u0027prays\u0027 that they\u0027re going to be \u0027reunited\u0027 with them one day.             Meghan poses with women at the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in West LondonMs Mahmud wrote of her involvement with the book: \u0027Last summer, we were placed in a hotel and I had no kitchen to cook for my family.\u0027It was very emotional for me to get in the kitchen. The moment I started cooking I was in tears. I didn\u0027t know why though. I was just excited to be back in the kitchen again.\u0027Word started to spread - the mums from my son\u0027s school came along and they told their friends, too.

Pictured, the pair at a Knicks game in 1994\u0027He pursued me. That\u0027s why the relationship has worked: He\u0027s usually a meek person, and he took a big leap.\u0027She declared that she was \u0027madly in love with him\u0027 and \u0027completely attracted to him, physically and sexually.\u0027But she also claims that she \u0027came to realize how understanding he was\u0027 and that he \u0027grew on me.\u0027Soon-Yi Previn eviscerates \u0027vengeful and abusive\u0027 mother Mia...\u0027Woody Allen abused me when I was seven years old\u0027: Dylan...Share this articleLater, she recalls the moment after the pair first kissed.\u0027I think Woody liked the fact that I had chutzpah when he first kissed me and I said, \u0027I wondered how long it was going to take you to make a move,\u0027 she said.\u0027From the first kiss I was a goner and loved him.\u0027But their first friendly encounter came after she broke her ankle playing soccer in the 11th grade, she said.          Soon-Yi Previn and Woody Allen at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden in 2006When she got home, Allen looked at her ankle and suggested she see a doctor.After this incident, the pair began going to Knicks games together.When they began their \u0027fling,\u0027 both planned to keep it a secret and neither thought it would last.\u0027It only became a relationship really when we were thrown together because of the molestation charge,\u0027 Previn said.The comment refers to Dylan Farrow\u0027s allegations that Allen abused her in 1992 when she was seven-years-old.Allen was investigated but wasn\u0027t charged, and he has long denied inappropriately touching his adopted daughter.He faced a wave of backlash earlier this year including several prominent actors vowing not to work with him again.In a statement in January after Dylan\u0027s allegations resurfaced, Allen reiterated his denial and accused her and her family of using the Time\u0027s Up movement \u0027to repeat this discredited allegation.\u0027          Previn (pictured right, with Allen, Mia Farrow and their children in 1986) said she fell in love in 1992 with Allen, who was Farrow\u0027s boyfriend at the timeThe director is also quoted in the New York piece.\u0027I am a pariah,\u0027 he said during a lunch with the author.\u0027People think that I was Soon-Yi\u0027s father, that I raped and married my underaged, retarded daughter.\u0027He adds: \u0027We weren\u0027t thinking, My God, let\u0027s get married.\u0027Our relationship deepened as we went through the barrage of terrible accusations, and the paparazzi forced us to take walks only on my penthouse roof.\u0027Previn told the magazine that she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child.\u0027I was never interested in writing a `Mommie Dearest,\u0027 getting even with Mia - none of that,\u0027 Previn told the magazine.    Previn (pictured with Allen in 2010) said she decided to speak out now because Dylan Farrow, is, in her view, unfairly accusing her husband of sexual abusing her when she was a child\u0027But what\u0027s happened to Woody is so upsetting, so unjust. (Mia) has taken advantage of the #MeToo movement and paraded Dylan as a victim. And a whole new generation is hearing about it when they shouldn\u0027t.\u0027Previn also said she and her mother clashed soon after Farrow adopted her and that her mother many times treated her like a maid.She also said of Farrow: \u0027Mia wasn\u0027t maternal to me from the get-go.\u0027An email sent to Mia Farrow\u0027s agent Sunday night was not immediately returned.In separate statements posted on Twitter on Sunday night, Dylan Farrow and Ronan Farrow say their mother is a good parent and that the New York magazine article is inaccurate and unfair.Dylan also noted that the New York magazine piece\u0027s author, Daphne Merkin, calls herself a longtime friend of Allen\u0027s."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/04/5053006100000578-6178627-image-m-68_1537242698874.jpg","title":"Colin Jost Michael Che aim Roseanne Emmys","story":"    Michael Che and Colin Jost kicked off the Emmys with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movement\u0027She\u0027s had a rough year,\u0027 Che added. \u0027I heard Roseanne is moving to Israel.\u0027 \u0027I mean damn, how messed up is your life you have to go to the Middle East to get peace of mind?\u0027 The hosts then mentioned Laurie Metcalfe, who received a supporting actress nomination for her work on Roseanne, to a round of applause from the audience.\u0027You know how great you have to be to get nominated for Roseanne now?\u0027 Che asked the crowd. \u0027That\u0027s like nominating a cop for a BET award, it doesn\u0027t happen - that would be weird.\u0027 The #MeToo movement was also a big part of the SNL hosts\u0027 monologue, hardly a surprise after it consumed television with the downfalls of Les Moonves, Matt Lauer, Louis CK, and Charlie Rose in the last year.\u0027You know it\u0027s an honor to be here sharing this night with the many talented and creative people who haven\u0027t been caught yet,\u0027 they joked.   \u0027This year the audience is allowed to drink in their seats...cause the one thing Hollywood needs right now are people losing their inhibitions at award functions,\u0027 Jost added.

It\u0027s relevant to ask with back pain about their job if they do a lot of sitting or walking and my interest immediately peaked when I heard about her refugee work and that interest took over.\u0027Previously I did volunteer work for Mother Teresa in 1981, worked in Jordan and refugee camps, looking after children.           The alleged victim has not given any statement apart from a wish never to see Dean again\u0027I put her number as a contact in my phone but only used it once. I now would never do that again as I understand about privacy and information\u0027.\u0027She came in with back pain and that was the focus of the consultation but I allowed my own interests to get in the way of the appointment.\u0027I honestly didn\u0027t think she would find it inappropriate and I am completely devastated as I do not want to upset patients\u0027.He has attended a course on maintaining boundaries between doctors and patients and says he has learned his lesson.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the incident occurred on April 11 2017 when Dean was working as a locum for a single day at a surgery in Gloucester. Iona Neve of NHS England said: \u0027We had a face to face meeting with Dr Dean but he did not seem to understand why the patient might be uncomfortable and lacked significant insight.\u0027It was worrying - his body language was more relaxed than expected and his attitude was poor and the information wasn\u0027t going in. There was almost a lack of understanding of why patient A felt uncomfortable and felt the need to complain.\u0027He was dismissive and his attitude was inadequate. He says it was profession to profession as they had a common interest in refugees. He liked to chat to his patients and often ran late to talk to them. \u0027He didn\u0027t seem to accept that some people may feel this is uncomfortable and didn\u0027t want that. Patient A didn\u0027t want to see Dr Dean again but she didn\u0027t want to make a further complaint.\u0027  The Cambridge-educated doctor has been warned about crossing doctor-patient boundaries in the pastThe hearing was told Dean had been given a warning in 2016 after another female patient made a complaint about him. At the time he gave an apology and a letter of advice was provided to him about professional standards.According to his Facebook page Dean whose oldest daughter works as an engineer in Stockholm and whose younger daughter is starting a degree at Nottingham university, studied social and political sciences at Cambridge before qualifying in medicine at Goldsmiths, University of London. He also studied a BA in Fine Art.He admits the allegations and the hearing continues. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/15/20/5038C11400000578-0-image-m-14_1537039745161.jpg","title":"Student leapt bedroom window landed HEAD pavement","story":"Alix Taylor, pictured here in hospital, started hallucinating, stripped naked, and plummeted from the first floor  The image, shared by her sister on Facebook, shows blood coming from her ears and her matted hairOne show lying in a hospital bed, battered and bruised, and another shows her sitting in a wheelchair, with her hair matted in blood, while a close up shot shows crusted blood in her ears - showing the dramatic impact her fall had.   Ms Taylor had been on a night out in Glasgow with friends when one of her male friends was violently sick and \u0027appeared to have been spiked.\u0027In a lengthy Facebook post Ellie told how her sister left the nightclub \u0027visibly drunk\u0027 and crying.She said her sister made it home and was comforted by her flatmate before going to bed.  British tourist is IMPALED through leg by parasol after...Mother-of-three, 25, dies a week after falling from 11th...Share this articleShe wrote: \u0027Fast forward about an hour, and two passers-by had heard awoman\u0027s frantic screams for help.\u0027They rushed round to see Alix completely naked balancing outside on her window sill.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.          Field learned not to talk about previous lovers and later became \u0027terrified\u0027 of running into any man she knew, regardless of whether or not she was in a relationship with him priorDuring the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.Field writes: \u0027This could not have been a good thing and I couldn\u0027t understand why everyone around him acted so nonchalant while this man was writhing in pain, panicked that his heart was about to stop\u0027.Field gave Reynolds a brown paper bag to breathe into and wrapped hot towels around his feet, face and hands. Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/11/4D5DD1A300000578-0-image-m-10_1529317344598.jpg","title":"Spotted Two 200k Bentley GT Convertibles seen time British roads","story":"    Seen for the first time on British roads, two 200mph soft-top Bentley GT Convertibles  were spotted driving in convoy and then parked  on a factory road-test on the A40 near Oxford today          The two top secret but only lightly disguised Bentley convertibles – both with their soft-top hoods in place and painted in a black and grey horizontal tiger stripe pattern - were part of a seven strong convoy of vehicles seen driving though the Cotswolds in GloucestershireFaster Eight: The BMW 8 Series is back - and it\u0027s set to...Share this articleThe convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchback.Bentley engineers were surprised and not wholly pleased when MailOnline recognised the two top secret cars and began photographing them parked in a large layby in Oxfordshire. One of the Bentley team said: ’Would you mind not taking photographs of our cars.’But parked up on a public highway, they were in the public place and therefore fair game to be photographed.Belatedly they attempted to block the view of one of the cars as two of the large golden 4X4s provided an honour guard for the convertible. However, by then the pictures were already in the can.At the beginning of September a disguised GT convertible was photographed in a spy-shot during high speed tests on Germany’s Nurburgring circuit. But this is believed to be the first time the car has been seen in public on UK roads.The third generation of the Bentley GT was unveiled last August (2017) ahead of its public debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and first deliveries in Spring this year.It is the most hi-tech Bentley ever launched with the world’s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond’s famous revolving number plate. A clever triangular ‘Toblerone-style’ device showing three different dashboard ‘faces’ allows the driver to choose which one to view.It is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie ‘Goldfinger’ on 007’s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5 – using three-sided faces, like on the distinctive triangular packaging of the Toblerone bar of chocolate.          The convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchbackThe new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 people. Some 66,000 have been sold since the first was launched in 2003, with the second generation in 2011.It accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds – 0.7 seconds faster than its predecessor - thanks to its powerful and enhanced 6.0-litre W12 turbo-charged petrol engine developing 626 brake-horsepower (635PS) and linked to a slick new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gear-box. Top speed is 9mph faster than the outgoing car. Fittingly, the braking system is the most powerful system ever fitted to a Bentley, with a total of 28 pistons.But it’s a bit of a gas-guzzler and averages just 23.2mpg, dropping to 16.0mpg around town.But Bentley bosses aim to make Bentleys ‘greener’ with electric hybrid and fully electric versin. It took the first step at this year’s Geneva Motor Show in March when it unveiled the new £140,000 petrol-electric Bentayga Hybrid sports utility vehicle which the firm is dubbing ‘the world’s first luxury hybrid’.          The new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 peopleBut new chief executive and ‘Bentley Boy’ Adrian Hallmark stressed that this is ‘just the start’ and represents Bentley’s first step towards ‘full electrification’ of the Bentley range as the firm seeks to shed its ‘gas-guzzler’ reputation.Hallmark’s stated aim is to have 100 per cent hybrid or electric power available on all models across the Bentley range by 2025. The new luxury hybrid sets Bentley ’on the path towards a sustainable electrified future,’ he said.Bentley say the new Continental GT is the ‘most technologically advanced car’ they have ever produced – with 2,300 circuit boards, five miles of wiring (8km), 92 electronic control units, and 100million lines of computer code , some 15 times the amount on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to make it all work.It also features a luxury Handcrafted cabin with 10sq metres of veneer wood that takes 9 hours to create and fit, eight handcrafted veneers plus four ‘dual’ veneers, 15 choices of interior trim hide, and 15 luxury carpet options, diamond-style pattern on knobs and trim inspired by luxury Swiss watch-makers, and 20-way adjustable seats with cooling, heating and massage functions.Bentley, part of the giant Volkswagen group, are proud the Continental GT has been ‘designed, engineered and handcrafted in Britain’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/16/01/4D49421500000578-0-image-a-9_1529107848181.jpg","title":"Traffic levels rise HALF 2050","story":"Traffic on Britain\u0027s roads is set to spiral by up to 50 percent by 2050 because of population growth, a new study has suggested (file image of the M25, London)The DFT study admits long term forecasts are \u0027complex\u0027 and the conclusions come with \u0027significant uncertainty\u0027. The Government has said it will use the forecast to \u0027inform the Department for Transport\u0027s road strategy\u0027.The predictions will not be used to influence decisions on specific local roads, which require more focused analysis. Labour officials meet after being accused of \u0027dragging their...Share this articleBritish drivers are expected to spend more time stuck in tailbacks, with the forecast predicting that the proportion of traffic in congested conditions will rise by between eight and 16 percent.Journey speeds are expected to suffer, too, with average speeds falling from 34 mph in 2015 to as little as 31 mph.The average journey in 2015 took 17 minutes, but this is expected to increase to 20 minutes by 2050.

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/18/11/05937BC9000007D0-0-The_Prime_Minister_pictured_at_the_EU_Council_in_June_has_made_c-a-3_1537265559498.jpg","title":"Glenn Weiss PROPOSES girlfriend Emmys acceptance speech","story":"    Glenn Weiss completely stole the show at the Emmy Awards when he proposed to his girlfriend in the middle of his acceptance speech          The Oscar director looked delighted and his new fiance looked utterly stunned after the proposal           The couple shared a kiss and a big hug after the special moment on stageShocking moment a bus driver crashes into Sainsbury’s killing twoKonnie Huq celebrates as husband Charlie Brooker wins Emmy AwardMoment Holly realises she made rude joke while the mic was onPrince Harry jokes everybody panics when they see The QueenSerena Williams maintains she didn\u0027t receive coaching at US OpenBaggage handler caught stealing from passenger\u0027s luggage in IbizaDavis claims Sandoval sent her this video of him burning her clothesBrandi Maxiell leaves interview after husband admits to cheatingMilitary mom reunites with her two-year-old toddler after deploymentWatch the entire launch of The Ocean Cleanup System 001, in just 60 secondsDramatic moment wedding is hit by typhoon in the PhilippinesThe camera quickly panned to his stunned girlfriend who looked on in complete shock over the surprise proposal. Weiss got a standing ovation and huge cheers from the crowd as Svendsen, who looked stunning in a silver-grey Sachin \u0026amp Babi gown, made her way to the stage.\u0027Hey, I didn\u0027t ask yet!\u0027 he joked.He pulled out a ring, telling everyone that this was the ring his father and put on his mother\u0027s finger 65 years ago.  \u0027And to my sister and brothers, I didn\u0027t swipe it, Dad knows I have it!\u0027 he laughed.The Fonz and Richie reunited!

The proposal was the highlight of the 70th Annual Emmy Awards show, which was hosted by Saturday Night Live\u0027s Michael Che and Colin Jost, and received a very mixed response from viewers, some of whom criticized the comedy as \u0027awkward\u0027 and \u0027flat\u0027.The SNL veterans kicked off one of the most political Emmys yet with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movement.Diversity was also the word of the night at the awards show, despite the fact that the show came nowhere close to last year\u0027s historical wins, which included the first black man to win a lead acting trophy, the first black woman to receive a writing trophy, and the first South Asian man to receive an acting award.Jost and Che brought the current events they discuss every Saturday on SNL\u0027s Weekend Update to Hollywood, and no recent headline maker was left untouched.Disgraced comedian Roseanne Barr may have been absent from the telecast, but she was present in a variety of jokes throughout the night.          Michael Che and Colin Jost kicked off the Emmys with jokes that ranged from Roseanne Barr\u0027s canceled show to Ronan Farrow\u0027s impact on the #MeToo movementThe SNL hosts were listing canceled shows saved by other networks when they mentioned Barr\u0027s axed hit series following her racist tweet.\u0027Roseanne was canceled by herself, but picked up by white nationalists,\u0027 Jost quipped. \u0027She\u0027s had a rough year,\u0027 Che added. \u0027I heard Roseanne is moving to Israel .\u0027\u0027I mean damn, how messed up is your life you have to go to the Middle East to get peace of mind?\u0027The hosts then mentioned Laurie Metcalfe, who received a supporting actress nomination for her work on Roseanne, to a round of applause from the audience.\u0027You know how great you have to be to get nominated for Roseanne now?\u0027 Che asked the crowd.    One celebrity who seemed to sum up the feelings about the SNL stars, who host Weekend Update together, was the ever-memable Chrissy Teigan who appeared to visibly cringe during a joke about Roseanne\u0027s show being cancelled over her racist tweet\u0027That\u0027s like nominating a cop for a BET award, it doesn\u0027t happen - that would be weird.\u0027The #MeToo movement was also a big part of the SNL hosts\u0027 monologue, hardly a surprise after it consumed television with the downfalls of Les Moonves, Matt Lauer, Louis CK, and Charlie Rose in the last year.\u0027You know it\u0027s an honor to be here sharing this night with the many talented and creative people who haven\u0027t been caught yet,\u0027 they joked.\u0027This year the audience is allowed to drink in their seats...cause the one thing Hollywood needs right now are people losing their inhibitions at award functions,\u0027 Jost added.The hosts, who came back onto the stage 40 minutes after the show began to note all six of the first awards had been won by white people, also touched on ersity.He noted that Netflix had the most nominations for the night, adding: \u0027If you\u0027re a network executive that\u0027s the scariest thing you can probably hear...except, Sir, Ronan Farrow is on line one,\u0027 he quipped to a roar of laughter from the crowd, noting how the New Yorker journalist has broken a slew of #MeToo exposes.\u0027You don\u0027t want that call,\u0027 Che added.Che cracked another controversial gag when he said: \u0027My mother doesn\u0027t like watching white award shows cause you guys don\u0027t thank Jesus enough.          The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problem          SNL stars Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson kicked off the number, noting this year\u0027s Emmys had the most erse group of nominees in history          Suddenly Ricky Martin appears and stops the production. \u0027You haven\u0027t solved it,\u0027 he says. \u0027This is way too white,\u0027 before leading them in the dance number \u0027The only white people who thank Jesus are Republicans and ex-crackheads.\u0027Che then noted how although things were getting better, television has \u0027always had a ersity problem\u0027.The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problemSNL stars Kate McKinnon and Kenan Thompson kicked off the number, noting this year\u0027s Emmys had the most erse group of nominees in history\u0027They did 15 seasons of ER without one Filipino nurse - have you been to a hospital?\u0027 he quipped to laughs from the audience.\u0027Even on a great show like Cheers, they made a show about an all-white sports bar in 1980s Boston and not one black dude walked in and then walked out?\u0027Jost listed a slew of new revivals that were coming out with people of color in the lead roles, before joking it would be balanced out by an \u0027all-white Atlanta\u0027.\u002715 miles outside of Atlanta focuses on white women who call the police on the cast of Atlanta,\u0027 he said.The hosts continued to get political as Jost joked that things were very different when the Emmys were first held in 1949.          They patted themselves on the back for giving Sandra Oh the first Emmy leading actress nomination to an Asian woman. \u0027It\u0027s an honor just to be Asian,\u0027 she joked (next to her mother)          Network FX also managed to score five wins thanks to the success of the Assassination of Gianni Versace, which took home three awards\u0027We all agreed that Nazis were bad,\u0027 he quipped as the audience burst into a huge round of applause. Che also joked about The Handmaid\u0027s Tale being painted as a show of fiction.\u0027The Handmaid\u0027s Tale takes place in an imaginary future where a group of people are forced to work and make babies against their will,\u0027 he began.\u0027That\u0027s what black people call history.\u0027The hosts also took a subtle aim at Donald Trump as they brought up the Obamas\u0027 new production deal with Netflix.\u0027My dream is they only produce their own version of The Apprentice and it gets way higher ratings,\u0027 Che said.The monologue came after an all-star song and dance number that jokingly claimed Hollywood had solved its long-running ersity problem.They patted themselves on the back for giving Sandra Oh the first Emmy leading actress nomination to an Asian woman. \u0027It\u0027s an honor just to be Asian,\u0027 she joked (next to her mother).

It\u0027s relevant to ask with back pain about their job if they do a lot of sitting or walking and my interest immediately peaked when I heard about her refugee work and that interest took over.\u0027Previously I did volunteer work for Mother Teresa in 1981, worked in Jordan and refugee camps, looking after children.           The alleged victim has not given any statement apart from a wish never to see Dean again\u0027I put her number as a contact in my phone but only used it once. I now would never do that again as I understand about privacy and information\u0027.\u0027She came in with back pain and that was the focus of the consultation but I allowed my own interests to get in the way of the appointment.\u0027I honestly didn\u0027t think she would find it inappropriate and I am completely devastated as I do not want to upset patients\u0027.He has attended a course on maintaining boundaries between doctors and patients and says he has learned his lesson.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service was told the incident occurred on April 11 2017 when Dean was working as a locum for a single day at a surgery in Gloucester. Iona Neve of NHS England said: \u0027We had a face to face meeting with Dr Dean but he did not seem to understand why the patient might be uncomfortable and lacked significant insight.\u0027It was worrying - his body language was more relaxed than expected and his attitude was poor and the information wasn\u0027t going in. There was almost a lack of understanding of why patient A felt uncomfortable and felt the need to complain.\u0027He was dismissive and his attitude was inadequate.

Pictured:  The couple together on the set of Hooper in 1978              The Oscar-winning actress (pictured on Monday) has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died on September 6 aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoirField has said that she is glad Reynolds, who died earlier this month aged 82 from a heart attack, is not alive to read her memoir. And now that the book is out, it is clear what she meant.Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14.Field describes how being with Reynolds was \u0027exorcising something that needed to be exorcised\u0027 but she was \u0027trying to make it work this time\u0027.The actress writes that from the beginning Reynolds was presumptuous and arrogant, introducing himself as \u0027Burt Reynolds, movie star\u0027 when he called her. It was 1976 and he had asked her to star in Smokey and the Bandit she had already found fame with films like Gidget and Stay Hungry, while Reynolds was the biggest star in the world at the time, thanks to films like Deliverance.Field writes she did not understand why Reynolds wanted her in the film because she was not his typical leading lady and she thought that the \u0027script stinks\u0027.But his motives became clear when, to her surprise, he announced they were going on a date for their first meeting.Field writes: \u0027By the time we met, the weight of his stardom had become a way for Burt to control everyone around him, and from the moment I walked through the door, it was a way to control me. We were a perfect match of flaws\u0027.Their affair was \u0027instantaneous and intense\u0027, Field writes.          Field says that from the first time they met, Reynolds began to \u0027housebreak\u0027 her, telling her \u0027what was allowed and what was not\u0027          During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit his \u0027mysterious and painful\u0027 health episodes escalated and a doctor used to give Reynolds an injection of \u0027God knows what\u0027 directly into his chest.

Reynolds also used to routinely use Valium and the painkiller Percodan to get through the day.During the filming of Smokey and the Bandit, Field writes: \u0027He was zooming the car down narrow roads, barely able to see around the forest of equipment and spouting reams of dialogue while I fed him barbiturates hand over fist.

If I give you two hundred that\u0027ll leave me with almost nothing\u0027.Field does talk about good times in their relationship like how Reynolds was an early adapter to the VHS player and that he gave her films such as The Searchers - the John Wayne western.Field writes about how with film made them \u0027love something together, which made us love each other\u0027.But Reynolds did not gel well with Field\u0027s two children, Peter, who was seven at the time, and Eli, who was four.He bought them go-karts for Christmas but they did not want to be bribed and his attempts to charm them \u0027flopped like a juicy fart at a family reunion\u0027.Reynolds became \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 around them so Field left them at home with her mother while she spent evenings with him, staying overnight and driving back early the next day.Field writes how she became \u0027overwhelmed with guilt\u0027 at neglecting her children for Reynolds ironically when she was with him she felt \u0027more trapped than with my children\u0027. When press reports began about Reynolds\u0027 cheating, Field\u0027s grandmother made sure she knew about it, calling her to report what was in the National Enquirer that week, and described the photos.           Field, 71, says in her memoir that her relationship with Reynolds was a replay of that with her stepfather, actor Jock Mahoney (pictured with him and her brother Rick in 1952), who sexually abused her from the when she was around six years old to 14          Jock Mahoney (pictured with Sally and her brother) was a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard          Field (pictured in 1967) writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027Field tried to brush it off but secretly she \u0027knew it was all true\u0027. She writes that she \u0027felt duped and a fool\u0027 but, still she stayed with Reynolds.Field writes that \u0027to be loved I had to stop being me\u0027 and in her journals at the time she wrote about wanting to \u0027run away, to escape from some hidden trap\u0027.She was \u0027bending myself into a pleasing shape, a soothing compliant cup of warm elixir that Burt was then lured into drinking over and over, until he became addicted to the seemingly unconditional love I was offering\u0027, she writes.The biggest role of Field\u0027s career was Norma Rae in 1979, about a textile factory worker who rallies her co-workers to unionize.Inevitably Reynolds objected to the role and told Field that \u0027no lady of mine is gonna play a whore\u0027. When Field said it was just a part she was playing, Reynolds mocked her, saying: \u0027Oh, so now you\u0027re an actor... you\u0027re letting your ambition get the better of you\u0027.Field defied him and took the part and on the last day of filming Reynolds drove to see her on the set and proposed with a diamond ring, which Field describes as \u0027not me\u0027. Field did not accept his proposal and they never married. She writes how Reynolds \u0027didn\u0027t speak and I didn\u0027t know what to say other than thank you, awkwardly\u0027. After Norma Rae finished filming, Field writes that her personality started to \u0027flare out\u0027, which was met with Reynolds\u0027 \u0027shocked disapproval\u0027. Field writes: \u0027As I began pulling away he tightened his grip, sometimes literally\u0027.           Field writes that Reynolds was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027            Burt Reynolds, who passed away on September 6, had a torrid romance with Sally Field for five-years starting when the co-starred in Smokey and the Bandit (pictured, 1977            After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the bookWhen she called him to say she was going to the Cannes Film Festival he \u0027asked in a huff what the hell I intended to do there\u0027, branding it a \u0027waste of time\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 tone changed to \u0027deep disappointment\u0027 and he said that he had been house hunting for both of them and that she was \u0027spoiling it\u0027 for him.When Field couldn\u0027t be \u0027bullied or seduced\u0027 into changing her mind, Reynolds lashed out and said: \u0027You don\u0027t expect to win anything, do you?\u0027 and slammed the phone down.On the plane to France she describes a feeling of being \u0027wondrously free\u0027. And at Cannes, Field won the Palme d\u0027Or for best actress and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress that year.Field\u0027s verdict on Reynolds is that people saw him as a charming, funny, good ol\u0027 boy from the South but inside he was tortured.She writes that he was \u0027engulfed by a massive wave of seeming instant notoriety, a sex symbol, and when his tsunami of collective unconscious slammed into him, he couldn\u0027t breathe\u0027.She writes: \u0027He also couldn\u0027t talk about it, couldn\u0027t articulate how it made him feel both empowered and terrified\u0027.Reynolds\u0027 fans saw him as the \u0027quintessential definition of masculine pulchritude\u0027 but according to Field: \u0027The human inside that dream figure was just a good-looking, ordinary person frantically trying to fulfill everyone\u0027s expectations\u0027,           Sally Field\u0027s revealing memoir \u0027In Pieces\u0027 (pictured) is set to hit stands September 18Field tells how when Reynolds was a senior in high school and playing on the varsity football team he cried on the pitch after winning the state championship.But his father came on the field and slapped him because, in his eyes, he was not behaving like a man.Field writes that Reynolds \u0027spent his life trying to prove to his father that he was a man worth loving\u0027. Field adds: \u0027He tried to hide everything about himself that he saw as being imperfect, to camouflage himself, which meant he got locked into a stressful trap of faking it\u0027.After Reynolds died, Field said she was \u0027flooded with feelings and nostalgia\u0027 and was glad he would never read the book.She said: \u0027This would hurt him.\u0027I felt glad that he wasn\u0027t going to read it, he wasn\u0027t going to be asked about it, and he wasn\u0027t going to have to defend himself or lash out, which he probably would have. I did not want to hurt him any further\u0027.Before the book\u0027s publication Field gave an interview to the New York Times which she revealed that the stepfather who abused her was Jock Mahoney, a stuntman who married Field\u0027s mother Margaret Field in 1952 after she orced her father Richard.Recounting the episode she writes: \u0027I felt both a child, helpless, and not a child. Powerful. This was power. And I owned it. But I wanted to be a child.\u0027Field writes that she had a secret abortion in Tijuana, Mexico, when she was 17 years old during her sexual awakening which felt like she was \u0027breaking out of my own brain\u0027.In 1968 Field got stoned with singer songwriter Jimmy Webb, passed out and woke up to find him \u0027on top of me, grinding away to another melody\u0027.Webb denied the encounter took place.While auditioning for the role of Mary Tate Farnsworth in the 1976 film \u0027Stay Hungry\u0027 Field said that director Bob Rafelson demanded she kiss him and said that \u0027I can\u0027t hire anyone who doesn\u0027t kiss good enough\u0027. Sally Field speaks out about her new memoir, \u0027In Pieces\u0027 Video - ABC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Bridesmaid received dress BA two hours ceremony","story":"    Nicole Park, booked a BA flight from Thailand to Heathrow and onward to Glasgow for her best friend\u0027s big day.

One of the Bentley team said: ’Would you mind not taking photographs of our cars.’But parked up on a public highway, they were in the public place and therefore fair game to be photographed.Belatedly they attempted to block the view of one of the cars as two of the large golden 4X4s provided an honour guard for the convertible. However, by then the pictures were already in the can.At the beginning of September a disguised GT convertible was photographed in a spy-shot during high speed tests on Germany’s Nurburgring circuit. But this is believed to be the first time the car has been seen in public on UK roads.The third generation of the Bentley GT was unveiled last August (2017) ahead of its public debut at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September and first deliveries in Spring this year.It is the most hi-tech Bentley ever launched with the world’s first three-way rotating dashboard that takes its inspiration from James Bond’s famous revolving number plate. A clever triangular ‘Toblerone-style’ device showing three different dashboard ‘faces’ allows the driver to choose which one to view.It is inspired by the rotating number-plate gadget used in the James Bond movie ‘Goldfinger’ on 007’s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5 – using three-sided faces, like on the distinctive triangular packaging of the Toblerone bar of chocolate.          The convoy included three Bentley Bentayga 4X4s (two gold, one white), a blue Bentley Continental GT hard-top and an Audi A3 hatchbackThe new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 people. Some 66,000 have been sold since the first was launched in 2003, with the second generation in 2011.It accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 3.6 seconds – 0.7 seconds faster than its predecessor - thanks to its powerful and enhanced 6.0-litre W12 turbo-charged petrol engine developing 626 brake-horsepower (635PS) and linked to a slick new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic gear-box. Top speed is 9mph faster than the outgoing car. Fittingly, the braking system is the most powerful system ever fitted to a Bentley, with a total of 28 pistons.But it’s a bit of a gas-guzzler and averages just 23.2mpg, dropping to 16.0mpg around town.But Bentley bosses aim to make Bentleys ‘greener’ with electric hybrid and fully electric versin. It took the first step at this year’s Geneva Motor Show in March when it unveiled the new £140,000 petrol-electric Bentayga Hybrid sports utility vehicle which the firm is dubbing ‘the world’s first luxury hybrid’.          The new third generation 207mph Bentley Continental GT costs £160,000 and is built in Britain at the firm’s factory in Crewe which employs 4,000 peopleBut new chief executive and ‘Bentley Boy’ Adrian Hallmark stressed that this is ‘just the start’ and represents Bentley’s first step towards ‘full electrification’ of the Bentley range as the firm seeks to shed its ‘gas-guzzler’ reputation.Hallmark’s stated aim is to have 100 per cent hybrid or electric power available on all models across the Bentley range by 2025. The new luxury hybrid sets Bentley ’on the path towards a sustainable electrified future,’ he said.Bentley say the new Continental GT is the ‘most technologically advanced car’ they have ever produced – with 2,300 circuit boards, five miles of wiring (8km), 92 electronic control units, and 100million lines of computer code , some 15 times the amount on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to make it all work.It also features a luxury Handcrafted cabin with 10sq metres of veneer wood that takes 9 hours to create and fit, eight handcrafted veneers plus four ‘dual’ veneers, 15 choices of interior trim hide, and 15 luxury carpet options, diamond-style pattern on knobs and trim inspired by luxury Swiss watch-makers, and 20-way adjustable seats with cooling, heating and massage functions.Bentley, part of the giant Volkswagen group, are proud the Continental GT has been ‘designed, engineered and handcrafted in Britain’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/13/502053BE00000578-0-image-m-16_1536840497280.jpg","title":"The booze map Britain Beer nations number one tipple","story":"    This graphic shows the biggest beer lovers in the UK, ranking them from 1 to 5.

Ms Spielman said the curriculum is a \u0027yardstick\u0027 for what school leaders want their pupils to know\u0027Pupil attainment and qualifications will always remain important as one measure of a school\u0027s effectiveness, and of course hugely important to young people themselves.\u0027From next autumn, inspectors will look much more closely at how a rounded curriculum is being delivered and Ms Spielman said a good curriculum gives a school purpose.\u0027Ultimately, the curriculum is the yardstick for what school leaders want their pupils to know and to be able to do by the time they leave school.\u0027It is therefore imperative that the new inspection framework has the curriculum as a central focus.\u0027Ms Spielman went on to highlight that, while the national curriculum \u0027provides us with an important benchmark\u0027, the way it is delivered should be up for the schools and school leaders to decide.\u0027It should depend on a number of factors relevant to a particular school\u0027s context and the knowledge and expertise of curriculum leaders.\u0027In response to this, Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u0027We support, in principle, Ofsted\u0027s intention to focus more on the curriculum and less on test and exam results.\u0027Done well, it has the potential to liberate schools and teachers from the grinding pressure of preparing for Sats in primary schools and GCSEs in secondary schools, and feel empowered to concentrate more on a broad, balanced and rich curriculum.\u0027Our concern, however, is that this does not translate into an Ofsted-prescribed curriculum, and we are reassured by the chief inspector\u0027s commentary which recognises the importance of schools having the autonomy to choose the curriculum which most benefits their students.\u0027It is essential that the new Ofsted framework champions the distinctiveness of schools to serve the needs of their communities.\u0027  HMCI commentary: curriculum and the new education inspection framework - GOV.UK"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4977b00d3080045cde79e91705293323cbb3e27b/0_600_8525_5114/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26e8bae97009a44bb31e4d67a001702c","title":"south london gallery knock knock review i like a laugh as much as the next miserable critic","story":"South London GalleryThere are old jokes, new jokes, even Welsh sheep jokes. But the real star of this show about humour in art is the rescued fire station much of it is housed inKnock Knock! Who’s there? A Welshman overly fond of sheep. Rodney Graham, seated on a park bench, eyeing the world through two small holes torn in the newspaper he’s pretending to read. A clown and a tin-foil flailing rock-god guitarist. Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse and the real Snow White. Here comes everybody.Filling the South London Gallery and its new expansion into the 19th-century fire station across the Peckham Road, Knock Knock – the title taken not just from the hoary old formula for a joke, but also from a drawing by Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein – has been curated by South London Gallery director Margot Heller and artist Ryan Gander.Knock Knock jokes usually evince a groan. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Stop me before I kill again. Artists who are genuinely funny, and whose wit is complex enough to sustain, and even to deepen, on repeated viewings are uncommon. Swiss duo Fischli and Weiss, David Shrigley, Ed Ruscha, Nicole Eisenman, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman all come to mind. They’re not here. Nor is Andy Holden, whose recent animated films, as well as being very funny, analyse humour itself in deft, often sly ways. Perhaps a funny thing happened to him on the way to the gallery.I like a good laugh as well as the next miserable art critic. Featuring a mix of old works and new, of pieces and artists who have shown previously at SLG, much of the humour here really has to be worked at. One-liners and no-liners, impenetrable sight gags that leave me dumbfounded, things that just aren’t funny at all, and perhaps aren’t even trying to be, fill the galleries. In one of the best works, Harold Offeh’s 2001 video Smile, the artist grimaces with a rictus grin to Nat King Cole’s 1954 version of the song Smile (Charlie Chaplin composed the music). Offeh follows the song’s injunction to smile, but it looks like a terrible ordeal.The big, open space of the original 1891 gallery is dominated by Joyce Pensato’s Take Me to Your Leader, an enormous charcoal drawing in which Mickey Mouse confronts a group of Donald Ducks. I like the drawing well enough, though its scale seems unnecessary. Martin Creed’s big, black diagonal stripes on an adjacent wall evince a sort of blank fury. A saw seems to be about to cut a circular hole in the gallery floor from below in a work by Ceal Floyer. Maybe she’s trying to help us escape. A brick foot and a brick ball, by Judith Hopf, aren’t going to have a kick-about soon, and if you try to have a go with Masim Bagdy’s basketball hoop you would break it. It is made of glass. Ba-boom.Many things here defeat me. Heman Chong has printed the internet 404 error phrase “Something went wrong. We’re working on getting it fixed as soon as we can” on one of the doors, while Maurizio Cattelan’s stuffed flock of pigeons have infested the gallery eaves. An old gag, but sometimes they’re the best. Bedwyr Williams has parked his bike in the corridor. The bicycle’s frame has been upholstered in sheep fur, the handlebars are a pair of horns and there’s a sheep skull poking out the front. Fucking Inbred Welsh Sheepshagger, it is called, turning the xenophobic English insult against the Welsh back on itself.The real star of the show is the building across the street, where the show continues in the old Peckham Road Fire Station, donated anonymously to the gallery after it was sold at auction in 2008 and left derelict for several years. Built in 1867, the fire station – with its horse-drawn carriages kept on the ground floor, and the firemen and their families housed above, has been gutted and rebuilt. 6a Architects have provided a stack of larger and smaller exhibition and project spaces, an archive room and a kitchen. Various original features remain (a fireplace hangs high on a blank wall in the opened-up full-height stairwell, and a replica of the original station gaslight hangs outside, the word ENGINES printed on the glass). A small group of concrete sheep nestle in the vertiginous stairwell. Basic concrete blocks mounted on old table legs, Judith Hopf’s little flock are only identifiable as sheep by the cartoonish sheep faces drawn on the bare concrete. Better keep Bedwyr Williams away from them. He might do himself a mischief.On the floor a man lies sleeping. Wrapped in a sheepskin and a towel, and his face painted as a clown, Ugo Rondinone’s lifelike sculpture has a drift of glitter at his feet. Like several other works here, the title of Rondinone’s sculpture is at least as intriguing as the 2002 work itself. If There Were Anywhere But Desert, Friday, it is called. Upstairs, Sarah Lucas’s latest mannequin perches on a chair. With her lewd breasts, long bendy legs and clumping blue velvet shoes that look far too big, Lucas’s Yves (named after Yves Klein, maybe because of the blue heels she wears) is as vulnerable as she is provocative. Ryan Gander’s animatronic pair of eyes, inset in the wall, blink and follow you round the room. Tom Friedman’s kitchen-foil guitarist flails his silver-foil hair. On a grainy video, Lucy Gunning’s 1994 The Horse Impressionists whinny and neigh. Still funny, Gunning’s work also feels old-fashioned, even quaint, like an old comedy re-run on a dead-zone channel.

It was the brainchild of scientist and inventor Edwin Land and his Harvard tutor George Wheelwright and at first made the plastic for polarising sunglasses. In time, it was to create and popularise instant photography, launching a seriesof pioneering cameras and film formats. These inspired generations of artists, including Andy Warhol, Helmut Newton, Robert Mapplethorpe, Maripol, Keith Haring and Guy Bourdin. They helped to raise Polaroid to the status of cultural icon.This month, Polaroid Originals, launched the OneStep+ instant analogue camera which brings analogue instant photography up to date, as it can be connected to a smartphone app, enabling a range of effects.In 1943, Land’s three-year-old daughter asked her father why she couldn’t immediately see the photograph he had just taken of her. His first instant camera went on sale for $89.95 in 1948, and became the the template for Polaroid cameras for the next 15 years.Throughout the 50s, the Polaroid empire grew, with products distributed to more than 45 countries. The Polaroid SX-70 camera – the first camera to produce self-developing, colour instant photos – was launched in 1972. Edwin Land also appeared on the cover of Life magazine with his “magic camera”. But, with the swift rise of digital technology eclipsing instant photography by the 2000s, in 2008 Polaroid announced that it was stopping making instant film.After the company’s announcement, a group of enthusiasts stepped in, calling themselves the Impossible Project, to buy the world’s last remaining Polaroid film factory, at Enschede in the Netherlands.Polaroid’s production chain had been abandoned before the Impossible team bought the factory later in 2008. There were no negatives, no dyes and no suppliers to hand. They had to start from scratch, and reinvent the lost recipes for Polaroid film. The company rebranded itself last year as Polaroid Originals after acquiring Polaroid’s brand and intellectual property, and is the only company in the world making film for Polaroid cameras.In its heyday, when Polaroid was producing 5,000 cameras a day, the Enschede factory produced more than 50m film packs per year and employed many people in the city of Enschede. Several employees who started at the plant in the 1970s still work there. Andrew Billen, head of global manufacturing at Polaroid Originals, explains some of the key processes in producing Polaroid film.First, the foil that will carry the developing fluid is prepared. A red dye is applied, which is a kind of semi-permanent adhesive. This allows the paste to remain protected from the air, but will ensure that the pod ruptures correctly when the film is ejecting from the camera, thereby setting off the development process.  Then the  foil is slit into the exact width needed to make sachet of chemical developing paste called a “pod”.Depending on the type of negative, a recipe of chemicals is weighed out and placed in a large mixing vessel. It is then heated and blended. The paste is then pumped out into smaller drums ready for the next stage.The foil is run through a machine where a very small, exact quantity of the developing paste is added then heat sealed into the pod. Pods are loaded into metal trays, which are then transported to the film assembly machines to eventually be laminated to each inidual photo frame.Rolls of negative are fed through machines with very sharp circular knives, cut to size and then wound on to cardboard cores ready to be loaded into the film assembly machines.Negative materials are light sensitive, so they need to be cut in complete darkness. A special machine is required and its operators wear night-vision googles. Non-light-sensitive materials  are cut on a similar machine in the lightTo make the film cassettes,  black plastic granules are fed into an injection moulding machine, heated until they melt, then injected into a mould cavity. The plastic is then quickly cooled and the  cassette is ejected on to a conveyor. Cassettes are then transported to the film assembly machines.In the final stage, the  border mask and sheet are fed into the assembly machine. Here, in darkness, they are joined to the light-sensitive negative.After going through a series of cutting, folding and laminating processes, a developer pod is fixed to each frame. A stack of eight finished frames is then inserted into a plastic cassette together with a metal spring and (sometimes) a battery. A card known as a “dark slide” is then added to the top of the packs to prevent light corrupting the negative, then the finished plastic cassette is welded shut. The finished pack is inserted into a foil pouch which goes into a cardboard box.The machines – installed in the 1970s – are completely analogue. Operating and maintaining them requires a great deal of skill and take years to learn. Operators will occasionally need to enter the machine and work for short periods of time in complete darkness. They do this without night-vision googles,  completely by feel.The factory also purchases vintage Polaroid cameras from all over the world. These are cleaned, repaired and tested. Many date from the 1970s, and spare parts have to come from donor cameras as new spares are not available.In the 80s, built-in flash and point-and-shoot capability quickly became one of the most iconic and recognisable Polaroid features. These developments were followed by the introduction of wide-format film for use in professional settings such as medical examinations and police investigations. The 80s also brought a surge of influential users into the world of Polaroid, with artists and photographers such as Mary Ellen Mark, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring and Sarah Moon. More recently, artists including Ryan McGinley and Nobuyoshi Araki have continued to be inspired by the Polaroid creative tradition.The 80th anniversary of Edwin Land’s original Polaroid company was on 13 September 2017. The date also marked the renaming of the Impossible Project as Polaroid Originals. The Polaroid Originals OneStep+ camera, launched this month by Polaroid Originals, connects smartphones via bluetooth to an app to access creative tools such as double exposure, light-painting features, plus remote trigger and manual modes. The app also permits use of a secondary portrait lens for close-ups. The new device also has a flash and long-lasting rechargeable battery.

He added that the open-cockpit would make the cars “probably the closest and purest driving experience to the Formula 1”.The cars, which will come in one-seat or two-seat versions, are part of the new chief executive’s plans to boost profits by introducing models particularly very expensive limited-edition supercars.The latest models are the first in a limited series called Icona, which reference Ferrari’s racing cars of the 1950s.Louis Camilleri, who took over as Ferrari chief executive from Sergio Marchionne, who died in July, said the company planned to launch an unprecedented 15 new models.Among them will be Ferrari’s first sports utility vehicles (SUVs) called Purosangue – Italian for thoroughbred. It follows in the footsteps of luxury competitors such as Lamborghini and Aston Martin.Camilleri said he has set a target of doubling profits to €2bn by 2022. He aims to increase sales to €5bn (£4.4bn) by 2022, up from €3.4bn last year.All of the Monzas have already been pre-sold to customers who attended the preview party on Monday night.The company said it would reveal pricing of the new cars at the Paris Autoshow in October, but experts said they are likely to sell for more than £1m each.

Nothing demonstrates this more than dragging himself up the ultimate hill, though not necessarily to die there: the Mumsnet Q\u0026ampA. Imagine Laura Kuenssberg with 1,000 heads, all of them angry, some of them breaking off to fight with each other, and you are somewhere near the horror.If I’d been running the shadow chancellor’s show, I’d have said: answer them in order, go short. The reason politicians agree to webchats is that they can pick and choose, but all this does is identify the questions they don’t want to deal with, then spray them neon. So it was that instead of replying to the first question – “John, why have you shared a platform with people who seek the destruction of Israel?” – he scrolled down until he got to “how can Labour improve its media management?”This latter question also related to the antisemitism row that consumed the summer coverage of Labour, but approached it so sympathetically (the media had established “a popular perception that Labour is antisemitic through and through, which is just not true”) that he should have fielded it last.The trans issue slipped through his fingers, in the sense that he declined to heave strongly one way or the other, no physical definitions of womanhood, no “trans rights are human rights” statement either. But sometimes water has a lot of truth in it: the issue won’t be resolved without the restoration of mutual respect it’s gone past the point where a Solomon can hand down an answer.The Mumsnetters were unimpressed by his Brexit replies, a medley of Labour’s stance since its 2017 manifesto, with all the awkward jumps and disconnections that make people prefer an actual song: Labour accepts the referendum result Labour will apply its six tests and vote against any deal that doesn’t meet them Labour will push for a general election (and in that case, negotiate its own withdrawal deal with the EU) failing an election, Labour will push for a people’s vote.His audience was unconvinced. “How exactly will Brexit benefit the poor and vulnerable?” “Why do we have to respect the referendum?” But actually, each of these statements means something different as the context changes around them. Respecting the referendum could turn on a sixpence into respecting the fact that people had changed their minds. Starmer’s six tests are like Trotsky’s transformations: unmeetable. A Labour government couldn’t negotiate its own withdrawal without a second vote anyway, so it’s hard to see this as anything other than a pledge for a people’s vote, one way or another.A couple of cute touches: asked how he felt at last year’s exit polls, he answered that he was more worried about the Conservative MP next to him, who was so pale that McDonnell thought he might need paramedics. He justified his employment of Jeremy Corbyn’s son Seb on the basis that it predated any parliamentary success he may have had by some years (weak, but quite funny: it can’t be nepotism if it lands you in a dead-end job).He defended the progeny of Jacob Rees-Mogg, as any right-thinking person would. He praised Tony Blair’s government for Sure Start and the Good Friday Agreement which is, give or take working family tax credits, what most Blairites would say. He wants better postnatal care, better rape conviction rates, better treatment of women inside the party who come forward with abuse allegations, and reform around the edges of the trigger ballot process which doesn’t necessarily extend to mandatory reselection. He’s open to the idea of a universal basic income, and the rest of his programme is fully costed. His mother, by the grace of God, worked on an actual biscuit counter in BHS he likes all the biscuits, so long as they are broken.It was only revealing in the broadest sense: the accent was all on unity, reassurance and a cool head. A splenetic and righteous crowd left without what it came for – full-throated Remainia and a roll-back on the commitment to trans rights. But John McDonnell, to use his own word, survived."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa34f28f79d14e9c833675af4d84f692f718aa3c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fba125aed7f8aa8805d8bca422055d45","title":"labour peoples vote brexit conference","story":"In Salzburg on Wednesday the sound of Brexit may be reassuringly anodyne, to ease Maria von May through a perilous Tory party conference. Climb every mountain and agreement is somewhere up there, will be the reassuring message from her ”few minutes over dinner” address to the 27 EU leaders. Only when – or if – she survives contact with her party will they put her impossible demands through the wringer.Every path looks blocked, every likely or unlikely deal set to be voted down in parliament. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says Labour will vote down any deal that crosses its six red lines. Remember those were all drawn from promises the Brexiteers made in the referendum campaign. That includes their pledge to keep the “exact same benefits” of the single market and customs union. If that’s impossible, so were all the fantasies sold to voters.Labour, gathering in Liverpool this weekend, faces its own great conundrums. Here’s its choice: it could emerge as the one party that can rescue the country from the morass the Tories have plunged us into, the one clear route out of both Brexit and austerity. Or it could descend into a hornets’ nest of internal strife incomprehensible to voters it needs to win over. A party at war over changing the rules to make every MP face an open contest at every election, obliging obedience to their local party, is a terrible look. It’s a rum democracy that refuses to propose US-style open primaries where local voters choose their candidate – the way the excellent Sarah Wollaston was selected in Totnes. Cracks run through the party, with new splits among Momentum people, and between Momentum and the unions, over new rules for selecting the leader.Nor is there unity among non-Corbynites, ranging from a tiny handful who might split, to a large soft-left of many hues who only coalesce when respected MPs come under assault from the hard left. Chris Williamson, witch-finder general, stirring up enmity in his threatening “roadshow” tour of seats of MPs he thinks insufficiently loyal to the leader, may not be organised by the leadership, but he could have been stopped. It did step in when Canterbury’s Rosie Duffield risked a no-confidence vote for attending an antisemitism rally: outrage at threats to a very popular victor of an unexpected seat saw them shut down within hours. But she was left shattered, considering her future in politics – as are many others, distraught at the bile flowing through their party.In his speech, let’s hear Jeremy Corbyn say something like this: “I will stand for no more vendettas against those who didn’t choose me as leader. Anyone using #JC4PM to abuse other Labour people, you don’t do that in my name. We are always a broad church – I know it better than anyone – and as a broad church, not as narrow sectarians, we will win.” That would be wise peacemaking, when any anti-Corbynites mad enough to split may vanish into the wilderness, but could still prevent a Labour victory.Here’s the question for Corbyn: after a disastrous summer of feuding over antisemitism, will Labour spend the week on display as a nasty party energised by who controls its own meaningless citadels of power – or a serious party heading for real power?Internal ructions are of Labour’s own devising, but it was never Labour’s fault that Brexit was destined to cause it agonies: how does it please its voters in Hampstead and Hull? Finally, a path through is emerging. As Brexit destroys the Tories – every deal, let alone no deal, looking worse than the next – this is Labour’s moment to step up as national saviour.More motions calling for a people’s vote have been put to the conference than for any other issue, mostly from Momentum-backed constituencies. The leadership clings to the formula that when all Brexit options fail in parliament, Labour wants an election. Well, of course it does, but even if the Tories are crazy, the one thing they won’t do is gift an election to Labour. So far, Labour and the unions have put the people’s vote “on the table”. The conference has this chance to turn it into Labour’s first option.Nervous Labour shadow cabinet members tell me the time isn’t right. Although 100 constituencies have swung from Brexit to remain, the polls are still not flowing fast enough. What if they declare for a democratic vote, and there is an election? A new Labour government would be forced into a deeply unwanted referendum. But there won’t be an election. Better by far to lead the upsurge of support for a popular vote that is coming from left and right of the party. The Tories have made such a mess of Brexit that “let the people decide” should be an easy message.To all who say it’s an undemocratic rerun, here are some good analogies. If a trade union leader calls a ballot and members vote to strike, when he negotiates with the bosses he brings them back a possible deal: he doesn’t impose it, but puts it back to the vote. A GP says you need an operation and sends you to a consultant, who, being more expert, gives you odds of success and reckons it will do more harm than good: you would change your mind, wouldn’t you? If you agree to buy a house, before you complete you have it surveyed. If the surveyor finds foundations sinking, dry rot in the attic and dodgy title deeds, you change your mind. Well, the Brexit surveys are in and each looks grimmer than the last.Let’s play optimistic politics. Corbyn should say: “We gave them every chance to produce the Brexit they promised. The endgame is here, but their Brexit promises have vanished. Now only a people’s vote can restore public trust – and only Labour can protect the country against Brexit damage.” That’s the victory path. Can he do that?For any delegates at the conference tempted by factional warfare, just keep focused on the prospect of a second decade of Torydom. Sajid Javid – regarded as a “moderate” – regaled the last cabinet meeting with a 10-minute leadership pitch worthy of his Ayn Rand spirit-guide. He called for “shock-and-awe” tax cuts for business, deregulation of workers’ rights, abolishing automatic enrolment in pension schemes and scrapping environment controls.That should knock sense into any Labour sectarians. So too should the success John McDonnell has had in recent weeks laying out policies and principles with the vigour of a man who seriously wants to win. Good to see him espouse the long-needed Robin Hood tax, which Britain has blocked the EU from imposing on financial transactions. He is making surprising friends: Lord O’Neill (ex-Goldman Sachs chief economist) told the Sunday Times: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government. They have captured the mood of the times.” The goal is wide open – if Labour avoids being its own worst enemy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd80b6c9e3dbedfbe6480e6e633d792c1a7cd102/206_0_3089_1853/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fabb2cdaad9aea820d4690a33576f45","title":"theresa may immigration committee free movement brexit","story":"Brexit was never really about immigration.Or so liberal leavers fall over themselves to claim, at least. They can’t bear the idea of being associated with a racist backlash and so they insist it was really all about sovereignty that all those inflammatory posters of dark-skinned migrants queuing at European borders and the cynical scaremongering about Turkey didn’t really have any bearing on the result, and that all they really wanted was just a fairer and more open system in which people could come to Britain more easily from Commonwealth countries.Even Nigel Farage sounded as if butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth on the radio this morning, insisting all he ever wanted was control of our borders and equal opportunities for Indians to come here just as Romanians once did.So it will be interesting to see what happens now the migration advisory committee has taken leavers at their word. Its long-awaited report on immigration after Brexit concludes, as expected, that once we leave the EU free movement should end, although it notes drily that that may leave us in the position of scrapping it “just as public concern falls about the migration flows that result from it”, and that both the benefits and the supposed negative impacts of it have been over-egged. You can’t help wondering where its chart coolly summing up the facts – no evidence that EU migration has reduced wages or job opportunities for Britons on average, although some possible impact on the young and lower-skilled some evidence that migration has pushed up house prices but also confirmation that migrants pay more in taxes than they take in benefits – was during the hysteria of the referendum debate.But what’s done is done, so the committee recommends a Canadian-style system favouring higher-skilled workers over lower-skilled ones, focusing on what iniduals contribute to the country rather than where they come from. It doesn’t put numbers on the table, or answer the potentially explosive question of whether Theresa May will now ditch her mythical and so far entirely unachievable target of reducing net immigration below 100,000.But in suggesting that Britain could use work visas essentially as a bribe in trade talks, offering preferential access to countries prepared to strike free-trade deals with us, it certainly doesn’t suggest the goal is to keep numbers down at all costs. The question is whether that’s quite what angry voters who responded to Leave EU’s ugly rhetoric really had in mind, or whether this ides the leave movement between those for whom it genuinely wasn’t about keeping foreigners out and those for whom, to be blunt, it was.Immigration has been oddly sidelined as an issue so far in the Brexit negotiations, partly because the EU didn’t make it an early priority for talks and partly because it suited much of Westminster to keep it that way. Downing Street is caught between two awkwardly irreconcilable opposites – the desire of many leave voters to pull up the drawbridge, versus employers’ fears that doing so will decimate the economy – and has been more than content to put the whole thing off for a bit.Immigration has been a profoundly touchy issue for the prime minister personally ever since the “hostile environment” she herself created as home secretary returned to haunt her in the shape of the Windrush scandal. And Labour was no more eager for a showdown with voters in some of its heartlands who don’t see eye to eye with Jeremy Corbyn’s liberal views on immigration.But like every other impossible question thrown up about Brexit, it can’t be dodged for ever. If nothing else, today brings us one step closer to the moment when everyone has to show their hand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7e3afeb5ede4c23517a6fab0ae456304997e404/433_0_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d41535853e6d7e1c3ee74d235308ce2","title":"universities glasgow slavery pasts legacy","story":"Pity our universities. They have become globalised into a competitive market, each one’s brand resting on the depth of its history, the accomplishments of its alumni, and the integrity of its intellectual rigour. What happens when these very features turn out to be in conflict? Take the University of Glasgow, for example, one of whose most historic figures, a former student and rector, went on to use his education to assist in the lucrative tax affairs of the slave trade. It’s hard to ignore the story of Robert Cunninghame Graham, receiver-general in late 18th century Jamaica, and owner of numerous slaves.We often hear about the role prominent members of the university played in the abolition of the slave trade. But on this, Glasgow has decided to take the intellectually honest path, acknowledging, exploring and owning the fact that Cunninghame Graham was one of their own. He married Anne Taylor, the sister of Simon Taylor, one of the most powerful slave owners and good friend to Admiral Horatio Nelson, who – as it is apparently still controversial to remember in England – expressed his support for Taylor’s line of work. Both Cunninghame Graham and Taylor had sex with, and – since relations between slave owners and enslaved women on their plantations were characterised by extreme imbalance and abuse – by definition probably raped these women. And in a final irony, Cunninghame Graham donated part of his wealth to establish a university prize for the best student work on political liberty.It’s an irony not unlike that characterising the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, who channelled some of his profits from black dispossession and economic exploitation into student scholarships. It’s a little known fact that when Harvard graduate Alain Locke finally became the first black person to win a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford in 1907, he did not complete his degree, affected by the traumatic racism he experienced at the hands of white Rhodes scholars from the US south.He went on to become one of the most important African American figures of all time, still referred to today as the “dean of the Harlem Renaissance”. Neither the basic fact of his existence, nor the troubled history of his studies, is remotely hinted at in any of the tour material at Oxford, so much so that one author wrote a book specifically to address it. Unlike their British counterparts, US universities have already started to redress the erasure of the stories that have been hidden from us – most notably Georgetown University, whose slavery archive has sought to trace the impact of selling 272 slaves owned by the Jesuit priests who ran it, to pay off debts in 1838. That’s partly because America’s history is harder to hide, and so has forced it to go further in revealing its legacy. Britain is, by contrast, hampered by a comfortable but misplaced sense of distance. It’s often said that the Caribbean is Britain’s Deep South – the British territory where enslavement, exploitation and racial segregation, as brutal as anything that existed on American soil, took place at the hands of British people, lining British pockets. But distance facilitates denial, and denial has deepened into amnesia.What to do about it now? Some aspects of the slave trade are at least quantifiable. The University of Glasgow has been able to put an estimate on the amount it benefited – between £16.7m and £198m in today’s prices. Its response is a programme of “reparative justice”, including the establishment of a new centre for the study of slavery and a memorial to the enslaved, and the renaming of buildings. This is progress, but for the descendants of the enslaved, it’s hardly “40 acres and a mule” – the reparations once promised to African Americans after the American civil war.The question of how different American society would look today if that promise had been kept remains the subject of heated debate in the US, often chaired and hosted by universities and their departments of African American studies. We in the UK do not have comparable departments devoted to understanding Britain’s role in slavery and empire.This is our bind. Without other universities willing to join Glasgow in contributing to scholarship on the legacy of slavery and economic racism, amnesia and ignorance deaden the debate. Yet a fear of that very debate is preventing institutions such as universities from acknowledging their history in the first place.So the University of Glasgow should be applauded for breaking through the paralysis of fear and denial. It’s no coincidence perhaps that this is a city that could more than most invoke the preferred excuse to avoid talk of race altogether – the “only class matters” trope. The city is often cited as an example of the intergenerational and persistent nature of white, working-class poverty. Only three-quarters of boys born in Glasgow, for example, can\u0026nbspexpect to live to 65. Perhaps it’s this very familiarity with structural unfairness that has made it less fragile and hesitant when it comes to asking hard questions about race in the past, as well.What Glasgow’s actions will reveal, I think, is that when an institution’s mission is supposed to be learning, refusing to learn relevant parts of its own legacy is not an option. These conversations about Britain’s history, and how it’s shaped contemporary society and identity, are happening. Avoiding them is a luxury universities\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspno\u0026nbsplonger afford."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f205ad7f8ec4c9638095ce8cadf12a5b593b3eda/0_0_8031_4819/master/8031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94dbdee8cc650e08e3affdcf04f6a656","title":"london fashion week the inside scoop","story":"Sex, gender and rebellion were what everyone was talking about – and designers with the most to say didn’t show clothes at allMy favourite part of a really good catwalk show often happens about three minutes after the last model has walked down the runway. There is the bow, the applause and then, amid the general rush for the exit, a breakaway group battles backstage (an inelegant bunfight, this bit) to pin down the designer, and record their thoughts on a swarm of iPhones.Sometimes, the chat is about Harris Tweed sometimes it’s about David Hockney. Sometimes it’s hard to tell, in the backstage din. One time, I thought Miuccia Prada said her collection had been about democracy and another paper’s fashion editor thought she had said it was about moccasins. Could very easily have been either.For the last few seasons, London fashion week has been talking politics in slogan T-shirts, but this season the tone shifted. These clothes will mostly go on sale next March, yet almost no one mentioned Brexit. Designers talked about sex and gender, and ageing and rebellion, and nonconformity, and mental health. Riccardo Tisci, making his debut for Burberry, was pretty much duty-bound to talk about the Queen and punk and flags and subcultures, but his chat backstage after the show was still mostly personal. “I came to England when I was 17, and very shy. This is where I cracked out of my egg,” he said. (It sounds better if you say it in an Italian accent, but you get the gist.)Christopher Kane talked about sex. The soundtrack to his show spliced together the words of Marilyn Monroe, who said she felt her sexuality made her a burden to society, and David Attenborough discussing sex in nature.“Everyone experiences sex uniquely and none of us really knows how it is for anyone else,” said Kane. (Case in point: the black lace tongues on his catwalk shoes looked like Playboy bunny ears to me, but Kane called them his “praying mantis” shoes. “She’s coming to get you, y’know?”).Erdem Moralıoğlu left a clue to his show on every seat, in the form of Victorian portraits of two famous sisters, Franny and Stella, who lived 150 years ago in the Bloomsbury street into which Moralıoğlu recently moved. The “sisters” were in fact Frederik Park and Ernest Boulton, well-known faces of Victorian nightlife, who were arrested in 1870 and charged with “conspiring and inciting persons to commit an unnatural offence”.“This was not long before Oscar Wilde’s trial, a time when London was becoming more conservative, and I was really interested in these people who dressed to be who they felt they were. And what I like best about this story is that the jury acquitted them and they continued to live as women,” he says.Huge veiled hats hid the fact that two men featured in Erdem’s line-up (although their hairy legs gave the game away.) Tailored blazers with an exaggerated nipped-in waist – an early trend for next season – brought together masculine and feminine aspects of Victorian fashion.Michael Halpern’s muse for the season was his grandmother, a snappy dresser in the Bronx of the 1960s – “a time when women’s rights debates raged and the foundation was built for an American future – now at risk of reverting to everything our grandmothers fought against.”The woman wearing Molly Goddard this season has, according to Molly, “acquired a slight flush and is unsure whether it’s down to the sunburn or the cervezas, but she doesn’t care and it becomes her … she has dressed to please herself.”The two high-profile female new arrivals on the schedule, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung, both addressed, albeit obliquely, the issue of getting older. Beckham cast Stella Tennant to open her show because she wanted her 10th anniversary show to be “about women, not just about girls” while Chung has started obsessing over style icons in the decades beyond their pomp. Jane Birkin in the 1980s, in jeans and sneakers in Paris, rather than in the teeny mini-dresses of the late 1960s.Some of the designers with the most to say at this fashion week didn’t show any clothes on the catwalk at all. Accessories queen Anya Hindmarch gave us utopia, shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood, dystopia. Hindmarch’s Chubby Cloud presentation involved lying on the world’s biggest bean bag, gazing up at a Rubens ceiling and listening to a live reading of the shipping forecast. It had normally jaded fashion editors babbling and weepy.There were no clothes to be seen, but the pop-up shop open to the 2,100 people who joined in over the weekend did brisker business than Bond Street. Nicholas Kirkwood collaborated with the actor Rose McGowan to turn a shoe showcase into an immersive theatrical production about a female-led resistance uprising, set in a sci-fi near-future Britain in which self-expression has been forbidden. Both shows plugged their creators into the fashion week circuitry in a way no simple model line-up could.But you will be glad to hear that fashion week did not neglect the most serious matter of all: what to wear next season. A blazer with a waist is probably the place to start: we saw these at Burberry as well as Erdem, and Victoria Beckham wore one herself on the morning of her show. Also, the body or leotard or camisole as a flimsy, filmy base layer to wear with some slouchy trousers or a pleated skirt is definitely happening. Polka dots are still the new stripes. Boardshorts are the new denim cutoffs.And the new black? Inspired by the vegetables-as-clutch-bags sported at Molly Goddard, I’m calling it savoy cabbage green. Because, why not? This is London fashion week. Crazy ideas are the whole point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8445a23ee8c9079a75e1a3848a3eda4268f5a94/0_64_1250_750/master/1250.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96e10c6fb403c850585c68ee05b53acd","title":"pimples in rise of acne positivity movement","story":"It was on a family holiday that Kali Kushner discovered, abruptly, just how others viewed her skin. “At the end of the day I washed off my makeup,” she recalls. “My nephew said: ‘Why is your face so dirty?’ It took me a minute to realise he saw my foundation as a ‘clean face’ and acne as dirt.”Soon after, Kushner, 23, from Cincinnati, Ohio, began documenting her struggle with acne on the Instagram account @myfacestory – her experience with the drug Accutane, dermarolling, makeup, scarring, hyperpigmentation, alongside all the ways people have responded to her acne, from her husband, who has been steadfastly supportive, to the traffic police officer who assumed she was a junkie. To her surprise, people began following. Today, with more than 50,000 followers, she makes up part of the growing acne positivity movement.After years of oppressive aesthetic perfection, acne positivity is a drive for people to be more open about their skin problems, from the occasional spot to full-blown cystic acne. It joins recent moves to celebrate the many and varied appearances of our skin – from vitiligo to freckles and stretch marks – but also seeks to educate those who still believe that acne is a problem for the unwashed and unhealthy.Many trace the movement back to the British blogger Em Ford, who in 2015 posted a YouTube video called You Look Disgusting. It showed her both in full makeup and bare-faced with her acne visible, as a succession of comments people had posted about her skin sprung up around her: “WTF is wrong with her face?”, “I can’t even look at her”, “Ewww, gross, horrible, ugly …”. In the first week alone, it amassed 10 million views. Ford, whose YouTube channel My Pale Skin now has more than one million subscribers, will shortly launch You Look Disgusting 2.0.Others have followed, including the Colorado Instagrammer Hailey Wait and the British beauty blogger Kadeeja Khan, as well as a host of celebrities – from Kylie Jenner promoting her favourite spot treatment to Justin Bieber’s Instagram post that claimed “Pimples are in” and Lorde’s sardonic replies to people giving her unsolicited skincare advice. Last year, Teen Vogue launched the inaugural Acne awards.Kushner developed acne in high school. “Whiteheads, blackheads, the usual stuff.” It was around the age of 20 that she developed adult cystic acne. “It was hard. And extremely painful. I had no idea what was going with my skin. Nothing worked. Or if it did, it didn’t for long.”She grew increasingly socially anxious, certain that everyone she met was staring at her skin. “One time I remember I was talking to my friend in class and started laughing at a joke she told me. As I was laughing, a cyst burst open and started bleeding down my face. It was horrifyingly embarrassing. I ran out of the classroom and didn’t come back for the next two weeks.”Dr Bav Shergill of the British Association of Dermatologists says that acne “often affects people without much power in society, such as adolescents”. He tells of a US study in which participants were shown a selection of photographs of high-school students with skin problems, as well as photographs of the same students with their acne airbrushed out, and asked for their impressions. The results, Shergill says, showed that “as soon as you have any disfigurement on your face, you get viewed as an introverted nerd”. Corrinne, an educational psychologist from Folkestone, turned 40 in August. To celebrate, she visited the Mac Cosmetics counter for a makeover. Sitting before the makeup artist, she felt horribly, painfully exposed. “I couldn’t make eye contact,” she says. “To sit there with my face naked, I felt so vulnerable.”Every morning, Corrinne dedicates an hour to the process of getting ready, with the bulk of that time set aside for makeup. She will use a base, foundation, concealer, then more foundation, then powder, then a spray to fix it. It is not an attempt to look unfailingly glamorous: “I’m just trying to get myself to a baseline to face the world.”It has been like this since she was 14. At school, she would wear makeup so thick it was “almost a mask”. She hated to be seen in daylight and would use a tiny vanity mirror rather than something that showed her whole face or full length. She spent an hour and a half getting ready for school each morning, and at lunchtime she would go home to reapply her foundation. At breaktimes, she would head straight to the toilets to check her concealer. Comments were made that she says shaped her. “I remember someone said I’d put so much make-up on, it looked like Polyfilla.“Without social media, it was isolating, lonely, secretive. I thought I was acne. I thought I wasn’t bigger than that.”In her 20s, she met a friend who had also suffered from severe acne. To find someone who understood so fully, who would discuss it openly and felt no shame, was hugely helpful to Corrinne – it was a taste, perhaps, of today’s acne positive attitude. “I wish we’d had that movement when I was 14,” she says. “I think it’s a fantastic thing.”When Kushner began her Instagram account in 2015, it was solely for herself – a private page to track her progress on Accutane. “I wasn’t really interested in sharing my journey at first because I didn’t realise that others were going through the same thing,” she explains. “I wanted to document my skin and side-effects so that I could look back on it and see how far I’ve come.”When she made her page public, it was an act of defiance. “If anything, my account was a rebellion against the typical beauty blogger accounts at the time,” she says. “There was no curation taking place, no filters, angles, and certainly no Photoshop. I would take out my phone, take a picture, think of a caption within four or five minutes and post it. It was and always has been about keeping it real. It was a call against stereotypical standards of beauty, saying that you don’t need XYZ to be beautiful. All you need is you.”This attitude has now spread to other previously flawless areas of social media. Jessica Olie is a fitness guru known for her Let’s Start Yoga ebook and an Instagram account in which she is often photographed holding yoga poses in charming locations around the globe. A year or so ago, Olie’s account broke its carefully calibrated perfection in favour of a new kind of honesty, documenting her orce, her father’s illness and her problems with her skin.Olie suffered from teenage acne, exacerbated by the constant exposure to chlorine as a competitive swimmer, and in her late teens was prescribed the pill. Five months after she stopped taking the contraceptive last year, her skin went “haywire” – worse, she says, than when she was a teenager.For someone who makes a living out of looking enviably, radiantly healthy, posting honestly about her skin problems came with a degree of risk. “If someone said: ‘You’re supposed to be healthy, why is your skin bad?’, I’d tell them just because you’re healthy it doesn’t mean your skin is good, and just because your skin is good it doesn’t mean you’re healthy.”And the pursuit of perfection can be wearisome. “I think I was fed up of not feeling pretty or beautiful enough because I had a few pimples. I looked at my friends who didn’t wear makeup and I realised when they had pimples they still looked beautiful.” Today, she posts pictures and videos of herself makeup-free, her skin mid-flare or masked by splodges of spot cream. “People put you on a pedestal, they think everything in your life is perfect, so it’s nice when people on social media reveal there are things they don’t feel confident about.”Kushner, too, has felt a shift in attitudes. “Honestly, there hasn’t been as much backlash as you would think,” she says. “At first, definitely. People will always have something negative to say no matter what you do or post or say, so that’s important to keep in mind. But now I feel like our little community has been able to educate those who were once ignorant on the subject. It feels like a more understanding and accepting place than it was four years ago. I only hope that it continues to grow and the community continues to shine its light.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344b4ed06a5be7a94d229c9910e32ce66e366026/154_449_4870_2922/master/4870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1e1671fb2b4a6fcf499d492d361381e","title":"richard quinn offers fashion education with lfw show","story":"After the Queen last season, this time it was schoolchildren the designer wanted to impressHow do you follow the coup of having the Queen front row at your fashion show? That was the question Richard Quinn had to answer at London fashion week, the first since Her Majesty watched on in February. For his third show, Quinn instead filled the front row with schoolchildren, from Quinn’s former school and sixth form – plus students from Central Saint Martins – who took up the space more usually occupied by celebrities and fashion editors.The students watched a show on Tuesday that had the drama to intrigue potential future designers. It was soundtracked by an orchestra and a film of thunder and lightning was projected on the walls. The first model wore a black tulle concoction, with black velvet leggings and a black version of the balaclavas in Quinn’s previous collection. The following outfits showed Quinn to be developing in the tradition of John Galliano and Alexander McQueen. Like them, he favours drama, romance and glamour. With print a running thread, there were flapper dresses with marabou layers, debutante ballroom dresses with a feel of The Crown, bright kaftans fit for a 70s-era heiress and floral 80s party frocks with matching tights.Pupils from St Thomas More comprehensive school in Greenwich, south-east London, were impressed. Isabella Marenhi, 14, said: “I thought it was really amazing. It reminded me of all four seasons.” Molly Farrell, 14, said: “I kind of thought the same. At the beginning, the dresses looked like raindrops.” Isabella added: “The way the models were walking and the look on their faces was really breathtaking.”In addition to his own label, Quinn manages a print studio in south London. Brands including Charles Jeffrey, JW Anderson, Burberry and Ports 1961 have used the service. The monarch was at his February show to present the designer with the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II award for British design, which focuses on a designer’s talent but also their value to their community. Quinn’s latest show further underlined the fact he was a worthy recipient.Victoria Beckham, who showcased her 10th anniversary collection on the catwalk on Sunday, finished her whirlwind tour of London fashion week on Tuesday by exhibiting her Victoria, Victoria Beckham collection. It included denim inspired by the Instagram account @70sbabes and a print of mountains that took Beckham’s childhood science kit as its jumping-off point. Her own T-shirt read “smile”, an appropriate response to a week in which an Instagram video showed the usually very curated former Spice Girl dancing to Spice up Your Life at a party on Sunday night. “I think we’ve proven this week that fashion didn’t steal my smile,” she said. “We have a sense of humour, personality and we smile a lot.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Score the fish on each side, 3 of 4 scores on each one, cutting almost through to the bone.Slice 6 medium-sized tomatoes thinly, about 5 or 6 slices per fruit, and set aside in a mixing bowl. Slice away the peel from 2 oranges, then cut the fruit into thick slices and add to the tomatoes. Pour over 1 tbsp of olive oil and toss gently together.Cut an orange in half and place cut side down on a heated grill or griddle. Mix 1 tbsp of sea salt flakes and 2 tbsp of thyme leaves, crushing them together using a pestle and mortar. Rub the flavoured salt into the sardines, then cook on the heated grill until the skin is lightly crisp. A little blackening of the skin is good.Remove the oranges and squeeze the warm juice over the tomato and orange. Season with black pepper and toss the ingredients together. Serve the tomato salad with the sardines. Enough for 2.In the past I often found sardines invariably stuck to the bars of the grill or the ridges of the griddle pan. This can be prevented by getting the grill or griddle really hot before the fish is added. The underside of the skin crisps quickly in the heat, then the temperature can be lowered so the flesh cooks right through to the bone. Putting raw fish on a grill that isn’t hot enough will almost certainly ensure it sticks.Sardines are not always easy to track down, but are plentiful during the summer and autumn months. Mackerel is a worthy alternative, grilled as whole fillets, lightly scored. Small fish can be grilled whole. A handful of onion rings, tinged brown from 10 minutes on the grill makes a worthwhile addition to the tomato and orange salad, as would some torn basil leaves. aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

The hosts will be a man down for last dozen minutes or so, but surely they’ve done enough.Messi receives a lob from Rakitić while squeezing in past three defenders and slots home his second goal. An absolutely stunning inidual effort by the Frenchman, who receives a pass from Coutinho, breaks free from a paid of midfielders, darts past Schwaab and pounds a screamer from outside the area into the top-right corner. What a goal.68 min: A golden chance for Suárez in the area off some nice interplay with Coutinho, who’s been excellent today, but the Uruguayan cannot convert.66 min: The first substitution for either side as the French defender Isimat-Mirin comes on for Viergever.65 min: Another counter by PSV and it’s Bergwijn again, but his shot is blocked out by the keeper. A corner. The visitors’ corner is easily cleared past the halfway line and they’ll start over from the back.62 min: PSV have numbers on the counter, but a low and hard strike from Bergwijn outside the area is gobbled up by Ter Stegen.60 min: Suárez down in a heap a few yards outside the area after appearing to get poked in the eye by Viergever, who escapes without a booking. Messi takes the ensuing free kick, again curling it toward the top-right corner, but this time it bends safely off target and out.58 min: Coutinho emerges from a gaggle of defenders in the area and fires a laser of a shot toward the far corner but a fully extended Zoet is able to get a hand on it and over the bar for a corner. 57 min: A pair of yellows for hard fouls in quick succession as the intensity of the action heats up: first to Umtiti, moments later to De Jong.55 min: Coutinho with all the time in the world finds Suárez barreling into the area with plenty of space but his shot sails over the bar. All three PSV subs warming up on the touchline with no one up from the Barcelona bench just yet. 53 min: A great spell of attack from Barcelona over the last few minutes and PSV are on their heels. They finally dispossess the hosts and a backpass to Zoet finds the keeper going one on one with a fast-closing Suárez, only barely clearing it from the danger.49 min: Messi nearly makes it a pair with a low shot from inside the area but Zoet is there to make the save. He’s been far more visible in the first five minutes than in the opening half.46 min: No changes for either side at the half. And it’s PSV with the near-immediate chance as Ter Stegen makes a hair-trigger save after a well-played cross into the area. A moment of brilliance from Messi opens this year’s Champions League ledger and is all that separates Barcelona and PSV after 45 lively minutes. More to come from the Camp Nou.45 min+1: De Jong tries from range with the whistle for half-time moments away but it sails over the crossbar.45 min: The fourth official has signals for one minute of added time.42 min: Another shot from distance from the hosts but Rakitić’s attempt doesn’t fool Zoet. Moments later Sergio Busquets wins a foul from Pereiro, but Rakitić’s free kick is off the mark.40 min: A bit of a slow patch for both sides over the last few minutes as PSV seek to get to the dressing room only down a goal. Jordi Alba tries from distance but it’s off target.36 min: Suarez has a go from range when he spots Zoet off the line but misses.34 min: Messi has now scored a Champions League goal in 14 different seasons, per Gracenote. He’s the third player to achieve the feat after Ryan Giggs (16) and Raúl (15).33 min: Shortly after the restart it’s another attempt by Barça, this time from Rakitić, but it’s blocked by Tasende.Messi stands over the ball, takes a short run up and casually curls it into the top-right corner past the outstretched arms of Zoet. Nothing the keeper could do. Just a brilliant, well-placed attempt by the master.30 min: A thundering run by Dembélé down the center of the pitch ends when the Frenchman is hacked down by Viergever right on the edge of the area dead center. The Dutchman is shown first yellow card of the match for either side by the Greek referee Anastasios Sidiropoulos. Free kick forthcoming and an excellent chance for the hosts.28 min: Rakitić takes a shot on goal from just inside the area but it’s blocked by Viergever. Moments later Sergi has a go but it misses the mark.26 min: Barcelona dominating possession nearly three to one at this stage, but PSV with more chances (five attempts with one on target) than the hosts (four and zero, respectively).24 min: Rosario is fouled by Suárez near the corner and Pereiro takes the free kick, but it’s headed back toward the halfway line by the well organized defense.22 min: Barcelona win another corner but it’s headed out and it’s free to Lozano on the other end, but his speculative attempt safely misses the target by a mile. PSV very much in the fight with a quarter of the match in the books.20 min: Messi finds Suárez on an impossibly angled, beautifully timed run in acres of space by the near post, but it’s well covered by the keeper and the striker can only find the side netting.17 min: Luuk de Jong wins a free kick on a foul by Sergio Busquets. Schwaab takes it from about 25 yards but it’s parried away by Umtiti.14 min: A crisp counter by PSV ends when Bergwijn misses the target. They can’t afford to waste those chances here.11 min: Luis Suárez, who’s scored five goals in 10 meetings against PSV (with FC Groningen and then Ajax), tries to find Coutinho surging down the center of the area but the Brazilian’s header sails over the bar.9 min: Barcelona are fast downfield after the missed chance and quickly win a corner. Dembélé takes it but nothing comes of it. Messi not being tightly marked early on, mystifyingly, but can’t get involved in Barça’s first real opportunity. 8 min: First chance of the match for PSV by the Uruguayan Gastón Pereiro, who rips a shot just over the crossbar.6 min: PSV with the high for the opening five minutes but they’ve yet to dispossess the hosts even if they’ve stymied any organized attack.4 min: A slow feeling-out spell early on with Barcelona keeping possession the middle third, probing for an opening.1 min: Barcelona attacking from left to right in their familiar home kits with PSV going from right to left in all-white strips.The players are on the pitch and we should be under ways any minute. A cracking environment as expected at the Camp Nou.Fifteen minutes to kickoff, give or take. Here’s a look ahead at some of the other big fixtures this week.Hello and welcome to today’s Champions League group-stage opener between Barcelona and PSV at the Camp Nou. The Spanish giants are off to a flying start in their La Liga title defense with four wins from four despite early conceded goals against Real Sociedad and Huesca, but could have their hands full against the Dutch champions, who have won five straight to open their Ereisie campaign under new manager Mark van Bommel.

I reckon there’ll be goals in the big one, too, even if both teams would be happy enough with a draw. The big news is that Daniel Sturridge starts in place of Firmino, who’s only fit enough for a place on the bench. Surprisingly, Keita will be sitting alongside him as Klopp has chosen to reintroduce Henderson to midfield instead. PSG’s midfield, meanwhile, includes Marquinhos, who has moved up from centreback because of the suspension to Verratti. Both sides showing an uncharacteristic touch of caution in their lineups, then. Well how about this for starters? Two of the most exciting attacks in the world trading blows right from Match Day 1 of a mouthwatering group – you can’t say tastier than that! Both of these teams have won all their domestic matches so far this season but neither of them have yet been tested in the way they are likely to be today. Will Liverpool’s new-found solidity withstand the sort of pressure that Mbappé, Cavani andBy the way, if you hear anyone calling Liverpool fans ball-suckers, know that they mean it as a compliment. Probably. It’s all to do with the Kop’s reputation for “sucking the ball into the net” on a big European nights, when the atmosphere can reach truly mind-altering levels. Think that’s just a cliché? Well here’s what two former PSG players said about the only other time this club has played here, which was back in 1997, when the French side arrived with a three-goal lead from the first leg and were nearly blown away at Anfield, where they clung on for a 2-0 defeat. “When it got to 2-0 I started playing for the first and only time in a match with no sound,” said the PSG goalkeeper Bernard Lama. “I could no longer hear the referee nor my team-mates - just the crowd! It was genuinely impressive. All I had to go on from that point on was the gestures of my team-mates and opponents. It was a singular experience.” The PSG striker Patrice Loko said something similar: “If they had managed to take it to extra-time I think they would have beaten us because they were being pushed so hard by their crowd. So very hard.” Isn’t it nice to know that real live people still matter and it’s not just about the watching millions? OK, that match was more than 20 years ago but PSG’s current manager, Thomas Tuchel, has more recent knowledge of how the Anfield crowd and, more pertinently, Jürgen Klopp’s attack ninjas, can overwhelm the visitors. But it’d be foolish to count on PSG bottling it: Tuchel, apparently, has made them more mentally resilient since his arrival in the summer: “He has changed a lot of about the team’s mindset,” said PSG’s Dani Alves,who misses this one through injury. “I have a good feeling about this season. Things are going to improve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3cde85ebecb07845481723aafdef225a9a9e08b/0_27_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b82188a4b76364f420ed31773c885ced","title":"your fathers not your father when dna tests reveal more than you bargained for","story":"Genetic tests are seen as harmless fun. But the secrets they can reveal can split families and leave users traumatisedThe first surprise of Michèle’s DNA test was how much saliva it took. “It was daunting. It took us, like, 20 minutes. And the more we laughed, the harder it was to do.”It was May 2016, and she and her now husband had ordered the kits as very early Christmas presents for themselves. They had been researching their family trees – Michèle had traced her father’s family back as far as the 1600s – and had wanted to test their DNA but had been put off by the cost. They were saving for a fertility treatment and had only recently moved to Florida from New York.But Michèle was considering going back to study, and she had been told she had some Native American blood on her father’s side – maybe if she could say how much, she figured, she would be eligible for scholarships. And so she and her husband came to be cracking up, spitting into their inidual vials. “We joked about sending them sweetener samples, to see if it still works.”In bed one night six weeks later, they pulled up the results from AncestryDNA on the laptop. They were impressed by the news about Michèle’s husband, which mostly reflected what he had always been told about his family. Then they opened Michèle’s results. “The first thing that popped up is a pie chart, and one whole half was red and said ‘Italy’.“I was dumbfounded. Like: ‘Well, that’s a huge mistake. They must have mixed mine up with someone else’s.’” She laughs, but you can hear it is hard-won. “My husband looks through it, then he says: ‘Honey, they didn’t make a mistake. This is you.’” That night, Michèle had her first ever anxiety attack.Recently DNA testing – once only accessible to doctors and detectives – has been extended to anyone curious about where they came from and willing to spend the best part of £100 to find out. Since launching in May 2012, AncestryDNA says it has tested more than 10 million people in 30 countries. 23andMe says it has more than 5 million subscribers FamilyTreeDNA claims 2 million.All of them are racing to grow their databases and their accuracy. AncestryDNA is especially visible, sponsoring the television programme Long Lost Family and running expensive adverts inviting people to discover their inner Viking (“This sword is your history”) or their innate links to the EU post-Brexit.It all sounds harmless, until you learn that as well as revealing customers’ ethnic origins, many DNA tests will also identify relatives in the companies’ databases. This “DNA-matching” can throw up previously unknown or unacknowledged brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles and aunts … or even reveal that the man you call dad is not your biological father. This is one reason that the UK’s Human Fertility and Embryology Authority is now calling on DNA testing services to warn customers about the possible emotional fallout.The kits that screen for genetic health risks can deliver equally devastating results. Yet all of these tests are typically taken in a spirit of casual curiosity. People are not prepared to have their lives rocked by what they may find out.As her results sank in, Michèle says: “I just got very quiet. All these things from my past suddenly started going through my head: questions, feelings, things that couldn’t be explained, things that my mother would get angry or defensive about if I brought them up. I started to realise: ‘I think I’ve discovered a secret.’”That night, she called her estranged mother, breaking their two-year silence. She strenuously denied any knowledge of Italian ancestry – and still Michèle thought there might have been a mistake. AncestryDNA’s database showed her as having first cousins in Syracuse, NY, where she had grown up, with an Italian surname she did not recognise.“I stood up, my laptop went to the floor, I dropped my phone and I ran to the bathroom and started vomiting.”In a series of text messages, Michèle’s mother furiously denied that her prom date was Michèle’s father, adding (Michèle says) that “it wouldn’t matter anyway”, since he had died in a motorcycle accident the previous year. “That’s how I found that out. It was very cruel.” Michèle found his obituary online, accompanied by a photo of a man with dark hair and olive skin. “It was literally the male version of me.”A subsequent paternity test of the man she had thought was her father confirmed that there was no relation. “That was devastating for both of us,” says Michèle. He had not figured in her life when she was growing up, and they had only recently reconnected. She had moved to Florida in part to be closer to him.Despite the absence of blood ties, he remains very much in Michèle’s life paradoxically, she says, the discovery made their relationship stronger. But she has severed all ties with her mother who, three years on, continues to deny the results of three DNA tests.Michèle’s story may sound dramatic, but it is not unique. Increasingly, DNA tests are bringing to light infidelities, adoptions, cover-ups and lies that have been concealed for decades.There have been cases of people learning that they were conceived from donated sperm or even that they were switched at birth, says genealogist Debbie Kennett. “There have been a lot of secrets covered up in the past, and they are starting to come out.”Last year, AncestryDNA made matches opt-in to comply with data retention legislation keeping a “can of worms” shut may have been an added bonus, Kennett suggests. The company says that while almost every customer encounters surprises on their “self-discovery journey”, these are mostly “exciting and enriching” for those with “more sensitive queries”, there is a dedicated team of experienced staff. Likewise, 23AndMe says it had specially trained customer-care representatives.“When people get these unexpected findings, they tend to distrust the science at first,” says Kennett. “But even close matches can only reveal so much in isolation. The DNA on its own doesn’t give the science – you need the contextual family information as well.”When, in June, Kathy Piercy was contacted by a woman claiming to be her first cousin, she was initially sceptical. “I thought: ‘Yeah, right – I know all my cousins.’ But there’s no doubting DNA.” She had joined AncestryDNA four months earlier to find out more about her ancestors’ journey from Ireland to New Zealand, where she lives “on a dusty road out the back of nowhere” in the rural Canterbury region. “In New Zealand and Australia, we’ve got different bits and pieces in us, so it’s more relevant. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular, because I didn’t know there was anything to find.”But Judy Poole did. Raised by adoptive parents, as an adult she forged a tenuous relationship with her biological mother, who refused to discuss her father’s identity. She had sent her sample to AncestryDNA in April hoping that it might throw up clues, but was not at all expectant. Kathy was listed as her first cousin. After some back and forth and “a bit of maths”, says Kathy, they pieced together that her father was Kathy’s uncle, who at 19 had had a fling before his marriage. He died in 2012. “Whether he knew of Judy’s existence, we will never know,” says Kathy. But she was able to put Judy in touch with his son, her half-brother – “and he was over the moon to have a big sister”, she says.Judy was taken aback by their instant connection – not to mention the physical resemblance. “I really do look like Kathy. I’ve got my father’s eyes.” She did not have an especially happy childhood, she says, so to have gained a new family has been “really special”. “If anything, you start losing relationships in later life – but I think what I really got out of spending time together was that I felt valued.” She adds: “That’s probably something that hasn’t been in my life before.”The finding has caused tension within House’s family, and some members continue to doubt it. That is the risk with DNA tests, she says: not everyone is ready to learn that what they believe to be true, is not – especially secondhand. “You don’t have to have tested yourself to discover that your father is not your father.” And as more DNA is added to the database, you could be in store for more surprises.Daily activity in an AncestryDNA community on Facebook highlights how easily they are uncovered. “Why does my sister show as a close family member or first cousin?” someone posted recently “Half sisters,” was the reply, “sorry if u didn’t know.” Another user posted about finding her father in less than 24 hours of getting her results: “I’m the happiest girl in the world right now … He didn’t even know I existed.”House says there needs to be more advice about how to approach those difficult conversations – it could even be included with the test kit. “People are being flung into these situations that are ethically extremely complicated and perhaps stressful, and they need to be able to manage it.“Anything they find out will have implications for their family. The advert that says ‘I spat in a tube and discovered I was a Viking’ does not give any sense that that is the situation you may find yourself in.”With tests that offer health screening, even surprises you have signed up for can have life-altering consequences. For example, 23andMe screens for genetic risk of diseases including Parkinson’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s, as well as whether you are a carrier for cystic fibrosis, among other conditions.Seven months later, in March this year, Altschule received an email from 23andMe, saying it had just been approved to test for three BRCA gene mutations linked to an increased hereditary risk of breast cancer. She opted in: “I believe that knowledge is power.” The results returned positive for the same BRCA 2 variant carried by her father’s cousin, who had gone on to develop cancer. The next working day she took a printout to a genetic counsellor.To get that email, she says, “is really scary and overwhelming – it’s different from a person walking you through it”. But it was also accessible. Being Ashkenazi Jewish, her risk of having such a mutation was about one in 40, which she did not know before she was diagnosed. “At first it doesn’t feel as if it’s good news, but I look at it this way: now I can take charge of my health.”She credits 23andMe’s testing with saving her life, although, she adds, it is hardly exhaustive, even for the conditions it does assess. “In reality, I probably have so many chances of developing so many things that the test doesn’t test for.” (A spokesperson for 23andMe stressed that it was not a diagnostic test, and that the many steps involved meant “the customer should be fully informed of what all the possible outcomes of the report might be, before they have even sent off their kit for testing”.)Asked if she would have agreed to be tested for a condition that she was powerless to prevent or reduce her chances of developing, Altschule isn’t sure. “If there’s nothing you can do about it, I don’t think it would be helpful.” But she seems to reconsider mid-answer. “It would definitely be hard – but if you have that information, I think any person just wants to know. But you have to be ready for the answer.”In August 2016, not three months after she had sent off her saliva sample, Michèle flew to New York to visit 80 family members she had never met. Michèle’s grandmother was delighted to meet her, her only granddaughter – and even more so to learn that she was pregnant. Her uncle took her to see her father’s grave.She remembers her four-day visit as overwhelming, exhausting and surreal. “It took me at least a couple of weeks to recover,” she says. “But they welcomed me with open arms.”Despite all that she has gained as a result – self-knowledge, a family – Michèle remains ambivalent about her “traumatic” discovery. “There have been times when I’m just kind of breaking down, and so angry and sad, that I say I wish I had never opened Pandora’s box,” she says, tearfully. Therapy, writing and, in particular, the birth of her daughter have helped her to move on.A few weeks ago, she felt able to return to AncestryDNA, for the first time in two-and-a-half years. On logging in, she was told her ethnicity results had been updated. She was gripped by a sudden fear: what if it really had been all a mistake?But, she says with a snort: “I was even more Italian than I’d thought I was.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c075f7ecb830ac974712231f1da692e5240652a1/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9705b84d59f9a0feeb0f696a47ce4ea7 1760w","title":"keir starmer clashed corbyn brexit brink of resignation customs union","story":"Shadow Brexit secretary said to have shown outrage at ‘ambush’ with customs union paper earlier this yearKeir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, was pushed to the brink of resignation early this year after Jeremy Corbyn and his allies tried to kick his customs union plan into the long grass, senior Labour sources have told the .Labour’s Brexit policy has evolved over the past 18 months through a series of painstaking negotiations between key players at the top of the party, the most fraught of which came at a stormy meeting of the “Brexit subcommittee” early this year.Corbyn’s close allies ambushed Starmer with a paper which shelved the decision on joining a customs union, a policy he had been pushing privately for weeks.Several people present at the meeting told the  the general feeling in the room was that Starmer was willing to resign rather than accept the proposals, numbered copies of which were handed out at the start of the meeting and retrieved at the end.“He looked close to telling them to shove it – and I think that did count for something,” said one MP present. “I think Jeremy was slightly surprised at how angry Keir was, and how pissed off he was.”Another witness to the confrontation said: “Jeremy started speaking, and Keir just said, enough, this was just completely outrageous. He did lose his temper. I think they were genuinely shocked at his reaction. They tried to bounce him and it completely backfired.”Starmer and his backers on the Brexit subcommittee, including Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, and Owen Smith, who was then shadow Northern Ireland secretary, argued a customs union was the only way to safeguard manufacturing supply chains and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.But members of Corbyn’s inner shadow cabinet, which includes Jon Trickett and Diane Abbott, were anxious about appearing to cave in to noisy backbench advocates of a customs union – such as Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie.They were also keen to ensure any stance the party ultimately took could reconcile the Brexit leavers and remainers.So they drafted their own paper, in a move that foreshadowed Theresa May’s attempt to bounce her Brexit secretary, David Davis, at Chequers, by surprising him with a handout that he, at that stage, had not seen.Within weeks Starmer’s proposal that Labour should sign up to the idea of a customs union – while insisting Britain retained the right to strike its own trade deals – was adopted. But Labour stopped short of advocating joining the single market.A Labour source insisted the paper had concerned only the party’s communications strategy. The source added that Starmer’s team had subsequently worked closely with Corbyn’s office.A source close to Starmer admitted that the meeting had been robust but insisted that he had not been close to resignation.But the face-off between the politicians underlines the tension that has hampered Labour’s progress through the political minefield of Brexit.Details of the clash emerged as the party confronts another critical moment in the evolution of its Brexit policy, with hundreds of delegates at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, which starts at the weekend, planning to force the issue of a second referendum.Labour strategists are sceptical about the idea of a new EU referendum, fearing it would risk alienating leave voters and could play into Theresa May’s hands, by giving hardline Tory rebels a reason not to vote down her deal.“The only way that her deal is going to get voted down, is if some of the European Research Group vote against it – and they’re not voting against it if they believe one of the options then is a second referendum. The surefire way to get the ERG to vote with the government is to talk about a second referendum,” said a senior Labour figure.• A special report on Labour’s Brexit policy will be published on Wednesday morning"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76082452c46dd305142c0c2d3a81c1faf9796f6/0_207_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=605b08dc6c9830e6d3a4e3a1684fbe7e","title":"vince cable liberal democrats party conference brexit","story":"Leader says Lib Dems should reach out to other parties in ‘march of the moderates’Vince Cable has urged Liberal Democrat activists to lead a “crusade” to liberate Britain from the “Brexit nightmare”, by making common cause with moderates from other parties.The Lib Dem leader was giving the closing address to his party’s annual conference in Brighton, where he sketched out reforms aimed at tempting a wave of new supporters to sign up for what he has called a “march of the moderates”.He insisted the Lib Dems would be “leading the resistance to the forces of illiberalism. Leading a crusade to give the people the final say on our future in Europe, and looking outwards to a changing world, with confidence and determination that our values will outlast and outclass the forces ranged against them.”In a strongly worded attack on both major parties, Cable said Labour and the Tories had been captured by the extremes – and the Lib Dems must “extend the hand of friendship” to disillusioned members from both.“Let them in. And if they are too shy to come in, let us extend the hand of friendship and co-operate with them,” he said.He added: “The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome.”With the prime minister battling to secure a deal with Brussels, which she will then have to bring back to parliament for approval, Cable hopes the Lib Dems can profit from the deep isions rocking Labour and the Conservatives.“The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Attlee to Gordon Brown.”“They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with Ukip than their party’s one nation traditions,” he said.Cable added that Brexit “fundamentalists” were prepared to risk the economic future of the poorest people in the UK in return for leaving the EU in an “erotic spasm” – a phrase that he garbled in his delivery.He compared the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to the US president, Donald Trump, calling the pair “the terrible twins of the rabid right”.As the negotiations in Brussels reach their endgame, and with a growing number of MPs in both parties publicly backing another Brexit referendum, Cable said: “Much now depends on the courage of mainstream MPs in the Labour and Conservative parties. They are losing control and if they can’t stop the rot, they should leave.”He also sought to capitalise on Labour’s internal woes, saying party members should “wave goodbye” to Jeremy Corbyn if he fails to shift his position and endorse the idea of a “people’s vote”.Labour will gather in Liverpool next weekend, with its members set to discuss the issue of a people’s vote on the conference floor, after it was forced on to the agenda by trade unions and local parties.The Lib Dems performed strongly in May’s local elections, gaining three councils, including in Cable’s backyard in south-west London. But there has been widespread speculation about Cable’s future in recent weeks, with aides conceding that if the parliament runs to its full five years, so that the next general election would be in 2022, the now 75 year old would not fight it as leader.He sidestepped the question of his personal future in the speech, instead setting out a series of policies he said would equip Britain for a future beyond Brexit.In particular, party members voted on Tuesday to back radical tax reforms that would abolish inheritance tax, instead taxing the recipients of large bequests – or lifetime gifts – at their own marginal tax rate, above a lifetime allowance.Capital gains tax would also be levied at the same rate as income tax under the proposals. The Lib Dems say the package would raise about £15bn in total – one-third of which would be set aside to create a sovereign wealth fund.At last year’s general election, the Lib Dems failed to make gains on the scale then-leader Tim Farron had hoped for, with the party’s anti-Brexit message overshadowed by his personal beliefs. He stepped aside shortly afterwards, giving way to Cable, who was business secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition of 2010-15.Senior party figures clashed in Brighton this week over whether they should celebrate or deplore the decisions they supported while in government.Cable’s deputy, Jo Swinson, said the Lib Dems needed to “own the failures” of that period while the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg insisted he remained proud of the party’s role.“There is this narrative hung round the Lib Dem party’s neck, which is just false, that we sold our soul, merrily went along with a savage, ideological approach to austerity which deliberately penalised the poor. It is simply not true,” Clegg said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9865b4640914d60b8bc779641f896366f632b333/0_23_3390_2035/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487cf0eba4b6d85427d37509e9796807","title":"what does your regional accent mean to you","story":"We would like to hear your thoughts and experiences for an upcoming article discussing the themeAccents can shape our identity.

The letter highlighted what it called the show’s “stigmatising portrayal of disability” and was signed by a Nobel laureate as well as film-makers, writers and activists including Monica Lewinsky and Lena Dunham.Billed as portraying “baffling symptoms and controversial diagnoses”, the show follows patients as they search for treatments and some relief. But it was alleged in an article in the LA Times that producers used “unethical practices”, editing footage to suggest participants’ medical conditions were psychosomatic disorders, using few expert doctors and focusing on sceptical medics who cast doubt on whether the iniduals were ill at all (that science doesn’t understand many health conditions doesn’t make their symptoms less real).The article points out that Dan Partland, the executive producer of the series, said the aim “was to give the world a compassionate window into the difficulties of patients and families struggling with elusive and misunderstood illnesses”. Yet the participants themselves are at the forefront of the criticism. Last month, several of those included in the series wrote a joint post on Medium titled The Truth Behind Netflix’s Afflicted. Participants in the show have been harassed online and have written that they have even been physically threatened or received death threats.These are people who trusted the programme-makers to help spread understanding of their conditions to the public, and say they were rewarded by having their lives mocked to peddle prejudice. As Jill Maxi Edelstein, who has multiple chemical sensitivity, wrote in her essay criticising the show: “I trusted you with my heart and my story, and now you are using it against me and my people.”But this isn’t simply about hurt feelings. As the letter says, Netflix reaches 300 million viewers worldwide and its programmes have the power to “reinforce barriers to appropriate medical care or disability benefits, dampen the support of vital research, and add to the stigma and social isolation of an already profoundly marginalised group of people”. There is a long history of disability being used as entertainment, from TV following rare medical conditions to dwarf wrestling – modern-day Victorian freak shows.When groups are stereotyped on TV, it does not just reflect the prejudices of the time but can be key in perpetuating them. Distorted depictions can be particularly damaging for people with chronic illnesses – who are typically disbelieved and told: “‘It’s all in your head,” but this goes for many minorities whose lives are used as entertainment fodder for the majority. The residents on Benefits Street, the Channel 4 documentary centred on a deprived Birmingham community, became synonymous with the “scrounger” rhetoric in the early years of cuts to the welfare budget. White Dee, one of the central figures in the show, later said the way she and her neighbours were portrayed “ripped us apart”, although a senior Channel 4 executive insisted that it was important to tell the stories of “distressed parts of our society”.Shows that purport to do good can fall into this trap. My Week As a Muslim, in which a white woman went “undercover” to understand Islamophobia, was criticised for using “brown-face” and centring the story on white people. If you want to understand racism, perhaps just listen to its victims.Controversy sells and programme-makers can create hate figures or a “freak” for added revenue. This gets more worrying in the age of social media. When television comes with hashtags, producers may whip up a crowd and then let them loose on their target.Ultimately, it is not simply bad publicity caused by an open letter that is going to talk companies such as Netflix into being responsible – it is viewers who can send the loudest message by switching off. Besides, who wants to watch ill people’s lives being exploited?“The spirit of much of what has been the #MeToo movement is to ide men and women,” Sean Penn opined this week. It is funny to say it is women speaking out about assault that is isive for the sexes rather than, say, the fact that men keep assaulting. As McDonald’s staff in the US launch an unprecedented strike against sexual harassment, there’s a sense that women are fighting back – and a contingent of men are feeling their dominance is threatened by the whole thing.The alleged victim of Trump’s nominee for the US supreme court – nominated by a pussy grabber, no less – has dared to speak up. Brett Kavanaugh has denied the allegation. “If somebody can be brought down by accusations like this, then you, me, every man certainly should be worried. We can all be accused of something,” responded a lawyer close to the White House.The question, of course, is whether these men “should be worried” because they’ve done nothing wrong – or they have and are disturbed that they may no longer be able to get away with it. As Penn went on, #MeToo is just “too black and white”. Assault is such a grey area, isn’t it? It’s the flipside to the idea that consent is too complex for men to understand – as if you may accidentally rape a woman as you try to ask her out. (Neither sex comes out of this well.)Consent, apparently, is simultaneously too complicated and too simplistic. Women – hysterical, isive, or vindictive – will throw accusations around and men can’t even flirt without a feminist trying to destroy them. Whether it’s at a McDonald’s or the supreme court bench, time is increasingly up on lazy, misogynistic excuses. If women speaking out is so unpalatable to men such as Trump, I’d suggest they’re doing something right.“What brings you here after all this time?,” asks a now grownup Jane in the new trailer for Mary Poppins Returns.

Both could receive suspensions for the latter if found guilty of the charges.It remains to be seen whether any England matches missed since the incident, which took place during the early hours while the pair were out celebrating a one-day victory over West Indies in Bristol, will be factored into any possible punishments.Stokes sat out 11 white-ball matches and five Ashes Tests while waiting to be charged by the Crown Prosecution Service in January (and missed the Lord’s Test against India last month to attend the court case), while Hales missed two ODIs in the immediate aftermath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff7b06ee04286ed8652e07e8ad6ced71e303e8f/198_252_2819_1692/master/2819.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e086881ad08ef2951b6e6c125dde0089","title":"surreys rory burns maintains push for england spot with runs at somerset","story":"This will not be such a stressful match for the pitch liaison officer. Two weeks ago in Somerset’s match against Lancashire 22 wickets fell on the first day here against Surrey there were four. Phil Whitticase can sleep easily unless he concludes that this surface is too flat for the good of the game – an unlikely outcome since liaison officers rarely reach that conclusion even though this proposition is sometimes well worth\u0026nbspconsidering.In fact this is likely to be a stress-free match for both sets of players as well. Surrey have already secured the Championship pennant while Somerset would like to guarantee themselves another second place. A couple of weeks ago this was destined to be a tense Championship decider but Surrey sprinted home as Somerset faltered. There is no doubt which is the best side in the summer of 2018.Do not expect a surface like this in Galle when England play their next Test match in November. In fact the pitch there will have much more in common with the one on which the wickets tumbled a fortnight ago at Taunton. But do anticipate some of the combatants here to be in Galle in six weeks.In all probability Surrey’s captain, Rory Burns, will be opening the batting. He shared a 147-run partnership with one of his likely predecessors, Mark Stoneman, who made 85 before he was dismissed by the Overton brothers – Jamie bowled it, Craig caught it in the gully. Burns hit a solid 78 taking his tally for the season to 1,319 the next highest run scorer in the first ision is James Vince with 896.Watch Burns for 10 minutes and he does not look a Test cricketer – he is the antithesis of Vince, a businesslike batsman rather than a beautiful one. Before the ball is released there is an odd twitch of the shoulders and an airy wave of the bat. But once the ball is propelled he is in an orthodox position and from there he waits for his chance to clip the ball calmly away. Note his volume of runs, a much better barometer of a player than the odd silky cover drive. He deserves his chance.All the other Surrey batsmen bedded in on this enticing surface and it was odd than none of them reached three figures in their total of 368 for four. Most of them, with the obvious exception of Dean Elgar, will merit consideration when the selectors gather to pick their Test squad for Sri Lanka, though this little audition would have been more meaningful if this had been one Taunton’s Ciderabad pitches. Stoneman’s chance may have come and gone but Jason Roy could come into contention before long.Here Roy batted at three in his first red-ball outing of the summer and on this surface he naturally looked every inch a Test player – unlike Burns. By his standards he was watchful at the start but soon there were effortless drives to the boundary plus two nonchalant flicks over the rope off Jack Leach. It all looked so simple for Roy whereupon he was lbw to Jamie Overton from the last ball of the afternoon session.Ollie Pope, a more serious contender for the tour party, was less fluent though still capable of some exquisite straight drives before he flicked to square leg off Josh Davey on 44. However, Pope has survived a remarkable season, in which he has become a Test player, rather better than Dom Bess, who was not in Somerset’s XI. In a bewildering summer for him those two Tests against Pakistan must seem like a distant dream.Somerset have their tour hopefuls as well. The most obvious is Jack Leach, who bowled 19 wicketless overs. His figures look very ordinary but he did not bowl too badly. Jamie Overton, who has an outside chance of a wildcard call-up, was the most threatening of the bowlers thanks to his extra pace on a day when there was barely a millimetre of deviation for any of the bowlers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/986171f34d745c342dd8816965fa6ed29eb64069/0_110_3488_2093/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd69b6ba617f49969d294bbfa03ec267","title":"surrey worcestershire county championship the spin","story":"When 22 players gather in huge stadiums built for full houses in midsummer, and rattle around in late season gloom to the applause of 20 hundred-weight of empty tip-up chairs and a crisp wrapper, County Championship cricket can feel a little soulless.But not at New Road, not last week. There in full view of the glorious cathedral, that has chimed the passing of so many seasons, Surrey clinched the County Championship for the first time since 2002. It couldn’t have happened in a more perfect setting.My only previous trip to New Road was in 2001 with three friends who were then young blades doing OBO shifts for  Unlimited – Lawrence Booth, Christian Ryan and Sean Ingle. Chris had organised the trip – as an Australian who was living in England at the time, he wanted to visit every county cricket ground in the country. So off we went on the train to Worcester, walked to the ground in the driving rain where play was called off without a ball being bowled. We decamped to the cinema, bought matinee tickets for X-Men and went home again. Loveliness, what loveliness?But last Wednesday the sky dawned a watery blue. The groundstaff were removing the covers by half past seven and the air had that crispness and brittle-warmth that you get only for a very few days in early September. On the river path alongside the Severn, schoolchildren with still-smart blazers trudged the heavy trudge to school. In through the gates and past the stands walked a handful of early visitors, breakfasted on enthusiasm, carrying flasks, past the Memorial Garden with plaques to Don Kenyon and other Worcestershire stalwarts, past the trees still, just, in their summer finery. With a nod and a wink to the utilitarian Premier Inn that leans over a corner of the ground, New Road was a little bit of cricketing perfection.The game itself turned into a thriller, whipped on its head by an inspired bit of bowling from Morne Morkel just after tea on the third day when he, from nowhere, eased through the gears and took five wickets for five runs in 38 balls. The fourth day had the feel of a walkover, with Mark Stoneman and Rory Burns at the crease, but Worcestershire didn’t go down without cranking up to full throttle, pushing Surrey with a wicket at each vulnerable joint, and an inspired spell by young Dillon Pennington, until Morkel finally won the match and the Championship with a hip tickle for four.A glance at the Division One table on Tuesday morning showed the difference between top of the table Surrey and bottom of the table Worcestershire to be 143 points – 47 points more than Worcestershire have actually won in the season. The difference is more even than that – Surrey is a thriving business that attracts full houses to Test matches and thousands to evening Blast games. They have big-name sponsors and pay their players a premium.Worcestershire is a small club, living a hand-to-mouth existence and given regular life-support by the ECB. The money that will come in as a result of the Hundred – around £6m over five years – will keep Worcester alive until the 2020s. What happens then is the million-dollar question. Is there a place for Worcestershire, run on heartbeats, sweat-beads and shoestrings, in the new cricket reality? Can a club that floods every winter and attracts small-time support to a beautiful cathedral city survive? Cricket fans will be desperate for them to fight on and so, despite their moneybags image, would Surrey – who carry a paternalistic attitude to the smaller clubs. It was they who pushed against the ECB plans for an eight-club Hundred, and wanted greater promotion of an 18-county Blast competition.Underneath it all, the town mouse and the country mouse have deep-running similarities. Both teams encourage and tend to homegrown players. Both clubs engender a sense of loyalty – look at Surrey where Alec Stewart is back at the Oval as head of cricket, where Rikki Clarke has returned, magnificent in his broad-beamed maturity. And at Worcester, Graeme Hick and Basil D’Oliveira stayed to eke out every last run.So the last week has seen a kind of rebirth of both sides. Surrey endured a torrid few years. They were a club in turmoil, with an unhealthy culture and struggling to cope after the terrible death of Tom Maynard, and were rebuilt by Stewart, Gareth Batty, and a handful of young, talented and hungry youngsters – Amar Virdi, Ollie Pope, Ben Foakes, the Currans. At New Road, Matthew Rawnsley took over as CEO at the start of the year and under Moeen Ali’s captaincy and with their own clutch of homegrown talent – Pennington, Tom Fell, Pat Brown (already being mentioned by Moeen as a potential England candidate) – they have won the T20 Blast for the first time – although Rawnsley would be quick to acknowledge that much of the credit should go to the former head coach Steve Rhodes.Stewart was keen to sing Worcestershire’s praises after the match had ended at New Road. “I hope Worcester stay up,” he said. “They also show that if you produce your own, they fight together.”Congratulations to the county champions and the T20 Blast kings of the road. The beauty of county cricket in 2018 is that it embraces them both. Let’s drink to that while we can.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

Since the Netherlands became the first country to award contracts to their women’s sevens players in 2011, the rest of the women’s rugby world has been playing catch-up – off the pitch at least – in the game’s rapid acceleration towards the pro ranks.Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Canada, the US, Russia and Spain quickly followed the Dutch lead and England eventually offered full-time contracts in 2014.So to the casual observer of Monday’s announcement that England are to offer full-time permanent deals to the nation’s top 15s players, perhaps it felt like old news. But that would be to underestimate a groundbreaking decision that is set to change the women’s game for ever. For while there is indeed nothing new about professionalism within women’s rugby, a full-time sevens game is a vastly different beast from a pro 15s game.Primarily this is because sevens funding does not just trickle down from a country’s own national union. Income for top sevens players, who are competing on the World Series and at the Olympics, is usually a mix and match affair with investment also flowing from the many other bodies which offer investment for Olympic sports. In Canada, for example, a significant chunk of its women’s programme is funded by Own the Podium, a not-for-profit organisation which funds an array of Olympic sports.While that funding is hardly excessive, it has meant the shift from amateur to professional in women’s sevens has been relatively pain-free thanks to a stable funding base, while at the same time allowing less-established rugby nations like Spain, Canada, Russia and – for a short period – the Netherlands, to keep up and thrive.The same will not be true in a professional women’s 15s world where primary sources of funding will remain union-driven. England’s deals will include a flat player contract fee plus match fees, on top of which leading players will be free to secure their own sponsorship and commercial deals.They will become the first permanent full-time Test team, having had contracts trialled for a year in the lead up to the 2017 World Cup, and will have rival nations like France and New Zealand, who currently offer part-time deals to top 15s players, watching on with envy.It was interesting if not naive to see players from other nations herald England’s decision and raise demands for their own unions to follow suit and create a “level playing field”. The stark truth is that there will be no level playing field and, just like the men’s game, the countries offering the most financial clout to their teams will streak ahead.But it will not all be about cash – it will also be about will. Countries like Ireland, Australia and Wales have yet to show significant willing when it comes to matching their potential with the funding that would help to realise it. Countries with less cash, like 2017 World Cup semi-finalists USA and former Six Nations competitors Spain, will find themselves expected to compete with full-time players and falling behind.It would be tempting to draw parallels with where the men’s game was when it turned professional in the 1990s but this time players are contracted to their union, a decision which will bring its own challenges while offering stability.As with all great steps forward in sport, England’s decision has in part been driven by pressure and by lessons learned in failure. The Rugby Football Union faced a PR storm at last year’s World Cup following the news that the players who had taken them all the way to the final would be out of contract and therefore out of a job just hours after the final whistle.The RFU’s announcement on Monday was a vindication of sorts for those, including leading English players, who hammered the union for their poor handling and short-termism.While it is understandable that the RFU’s decision has been reported in some quarters as a U-turn, the truth is it is so much more than that: women’s 15s is going pro and the game is set to change for ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6157e57853c0e2671b502425e4af04ba39beecde/0_5_6570_3942/master/6570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22ca853e6a283a4d77736442871a3a1","title":"steel review sharp witted political drama from chris bush","story":"Crucible, SheffieldBush tackles sexism and racial prejudice in a cross-generational commentary on contemporary politicsIn Chris Bush’s new play, steel is a multi-faceted metaphor. It’s resolve. It’s the unbending tenacity needed to break into a world designed to exclude you. And it’s Sheffield, the never-named but ever-present backdrop to her sharp-witted political drama. In 1988, a young woman of colour fights to get elected to the local council. In 2018, her present-day counterpart is the ambitious candidate parachuted in from London for the metro mayor contest – or, at least, so her Yorkshire-born-and-bred antagonists believe.Amid the plastic chairs and scuffed wooden fittings of Madeleine Girling’s beautifully observed set, both time frames stage a meeting of new blood and old guard. In the 80s, steelworks engineer and union rep Josie is taken under the wing of old hand Dai in the present, Vanessa forms an uneasy working partnership with her election officer Ian, a proud local and old-fashioned Labour man. Alongside sexism and racial prejudice, the two women confront generational differences and, in Vanessa’s case, the north-south ide. “You don’t fit here,” says Ian, meaning Sheffield – though he might as well be talking about the male-dominated world of politics.Snapping between roles, Rebecca Scroggs and Nigel Betts perform in both eras, their consistent presence stressing how little has changed in 30 years. The young black woman is still having to appease the older white man. The self-styled “good guys” still have an ugly streak of misogyny. In both of her roles, Scroggs captures the tension between speaking one’s mind and holding one’s tongue, while Betts tacks between condescending benevolence and wounded pride.At times, the play verges on editorialising, but the arguments that dart across the stage always feel deeply rooted in the beliefs of the characters. And they are debates that we still need to be having. As Vanessa and Josie know, representation matters. In Vanessa’s words, “if you represent you can inspire”. For all the petty disagreement and lost faith that characterises contemporary politics, Steel makes it rousingly clear why some battles remain worth fighting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9acb76ab99524edd5e56a3696c4ff9596f837e1f/112_434_4796_2878/master/4796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3673ff27cd30afd3f9c3dad4886675d2","title":"iphone xs max review roundup iphone xr","story":"Early consensus from tech press is these are best iPhones to date. But is it worth holding on for the cheaper iPhone XR?The first wave of verdicts from select reviewers given early access to Apple’s latest iPhone XS and XS Max are live.Gone are the traditional iPhones of yesteryear, with three devices launched all with a design in line with last year’s iPhone X. The iPhone XS is a direct replacement for the 2017 iPhone X, complete with a 5.8in screen costing £999. The iPhone XS Max is a larger, more expensive phone costing £1,099 and with a 6.5in screen, the largest on an iPhone.The iPhone XR is a slightly cheaper phone costing £749 with a 6.1in screen, but it won’t be released until October., not given early access to the new phones, will review them when they arrive in the post with normal punters’ pre-orders. But for now, this is what a privileged few thought of the to most expensive iPhones for 2018.It’s a pretty and premium design befitting of a phone which starts at £999, but also one which strikes me as being still worryingly susceptible to damage. The glass back is slippery when not covered in a case, though it doesn’t seem to collect as many fingerprints as the iPhone X, and it’s fairly heavy despite being thin. It also looks and feels expensive, which is just as well, because it is.But it is the camera improvements that are worth buying:The XS series is a significant improvement on the X – colour is richer and more evenly dispersed (this is thanks to the Quad-LED True Tone flash), with brights and neons really popping, and texture is captured in higher quality. These are best evidenced in portraits of people: skin and hair is closer to life than the photos taken in previous models.The better sensor and the new image processor on the A12 Bionic chip combine to enable what Apple calls “Smart HDR.” In practice, that means my photos look better in low light and extreme contrast situations, making for better pictures whether shot on a night-time street, in a dark bar or in bright sunlight.Bright lights in my living room show more detail now, and don’t turn into blown-up bright spots like they used to. I see more detail around windows and street lights. I’m also finding less blur and noise in most shots. Sometimes, it almost seems like too much light. The colour and brightness of some shots is surprising. I’m much happier with my photos now.FaceID on the XS is ever so slightly faster than the X — just an extra beat quicker. It’s noticeable side by side, but it’s not so much faster that you won’t find yourself pointedly staring at the phone to unlock it from time to time. iOS 12 lets you add a “secondary appearance,” which allows you to set up a second person if you want, which is nice.Other than the minor speed increase and secondary appearance support, FaceID is still FaceID: it doesn’t work in landscape or upside down or anything like that. If you wear glasses like me, you’ll still have to enter your passcode every morning when you wake up because you’re holding the phone too close to your face for it to work. And sunglasses that block IR light will still prevent it from working — Apple says it’s working with sunglass makers to ship new kinds of sunglasses that support FaceID. (Only Apple can get another entirely different industry to adapt to its phone, instead of the other way around.)The XS is basically a new model with some improvements. Most of those improvements, though, are kind of hard to notice.Take the screen, for example. It’s still a brilliant, colourful and sharp OLED display that supports next-gen HDR 4K video. It’s one of the best screens on the market, up there with the display on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. But some of the improvements, like its increased dynamic range, can only be spotted when viewing photos. And even then, I don’t think most folks will notice. This isn’t bad it just means the screen is still really good and we’re getting to a point where it’s hard to distinguish upgrades.Aside from one of the phones having a giant display, the iPhone XS and the larger iPhone XS Max don’t feel much different from last year’s iPhone X. This year’s phones don’t spark strong feelings – except maybe chagrin that they cost so much.It’s impressive incrementalism: There’s a noticeably faster chip, and a camera that captures a greater level of detail that you can actually see. Apple has nudged innovation in smartphones forward again, even if some of the results (like new apps that will use the new tech) have yet to be experienced.With subtle but strong improvements over last year’s X, (subtle, that’s what the S stands for, right?) the XS and XS Max are fabulous phones. But we’ve hit a point where every smartphone is great — it comes down to what you want and what you want to spend.Don’t blame me, blame Apple … and keep your wallet closed. See you in a month with the XR review.Stern also noted that you’ll probably need a case if you do buy one of these £1,000+ phones:Both the XS and XS Max have what Apple says is “the most durable glass in the world.” That said, my XS Max review unit cracked after a minor fall onto wood. All these glass slabs still need protection.The iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.The result is a phone that doesn’t sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it’s a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.We compared the iPhone XS Max to a number of phones during our in-depth review, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.4-inch screen), OnePlus 6 (6.2-inch) and Sony Xperia XZ3 (6-inch), and the iPhone felt thicker, and less planted in the hand then all of them.The funny thing is though, the iPhone XS Max is thinner than all of those phones at just 7.7mm.The reason for this is simple: tapered edges. The Samsung, Sony and OnePlus all taper their rear edges, giving the impression of a thinner device while also allowing them to sit a little better in the curvature of your hand.The iPhone XS Max has a totally flat back that’s a little more awkward to hold, and we found that a tactfully-placed pinkie finger on the underside of the phone was a must for one-handed use.There’s been a lot of discussion raging online over whether it’s too big, which I wholly disagree with.The iPhone XS Max demands two hands, and how much you enjoy this will hinge on how accustomed you are to using larger handsets. I’ve been a fan of larger phones for years, so not being able to text one-handed or having to stretch my hand up to reach and pull down the Control Centre is worth it in terms of the benefits presented by a larger screen: higher resolution, making watching TV, films and videos a better experience, and making it easier to play games, write documents and emails and edit photos.If you don’t like larger phones, the answer is simple: no one’s forcing you to buy one.So while the iPhone XS and XS Max appear to be the best smartphones Apple has made, and you won’t be disappointed if you’re an iPhone-only buyer and have already pre-ordered them, it might be worth waiting to see what the marginally cheaper iPhone XR is like before sinking £1,000 into a new iPhone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe321c88e58b1a41f0c30c92a6c410a7c5b70053/0_61_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff9c6abb1cbc6376f5200e0712fd4d0","title":"tesla investigation elon musk tweets reports","story":"More bad news is piling up for Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of the electronic car company Tesla. According to news reports, Tesla is now under investigation by the US justice department over statements the company and Musk made last month.Tesla’s value has fallen by almost a third since his initial tweets, wiping nearly $18bn off the value of the company.The investigation comes on top of a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawsuits from investors.Tesla said in a statement: “Last month, following Elon’s announcement that he was considering taking the company private, Tesla received a voluntary request for documents from the DoJ and has been cooperative in responding to it.“We have not received a subpoena, a request for testimony, or any other formal process. We respect the DoJ’s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.”Last month Musk tweetedhe was contemplating taking Tesla private and had “funding secured” for the deal. The tweet sent Tesla’s share price soaring, but the price collapsed after it emerged that funding had not been secured.Earlier this month Musk abandoned plans to take Tesla private after shareholders had persuaded him against the idea.“Although the majority of shareholders I spoke to said they would remain with Tesla if we went private, the sentiment, in a nutshell, was, ‘Please don’t do this’,” Musk wrote in the blogpost.The latests legal issues come as investors have become increasingly concerned about Musk’s behaviour. The Tesla boss is being sued by British er Vernon Unsworth after Musk falsely accused Unsworth of being a “pedo”. Unsworth helped rescue the young football players trapped in a Thai cave and had criticized Musk’s plans to send a miniature submarine to help the rescue effort.Tesla’s shares took another tumble in early September when Musk smoked marijuana on a live web show and two senior executives announced they were leaving."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40b1c4df17c6914f58e8f6716ef2d1617d7fd03c/0_217_3275_1966/master/3275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e871a1f1968357238e7c496a1bfd28c","title":"different paths mutual respect susan and jo wokoma on sisterhood","story":"Susan’s an actor and Jo’s a nurse – the Wokoma sisters inhabit very different worlds. But that doesn’t prevent them being each other’s most avid supporter“Jo has this incredibly noble job,” says Susan Wokoma of her little sister, a nurse. “But she’ll say: ‘When we were growing up, we’d watch TV and now you’re in programmes I watch.’ That makes me feel proud of what I’ve done.”Since graduating from drama school in 2010, Susan has rarely been off our screens, notably with parts in supernatural teen drama Crazyhead and cult hit Chewing Gum. She’s also been successful on stage, making her West End debut in 2017 in James Graham’s Labour of Love. It means that although she and Jo still live close to one another in south London, where they grew up, they can sometimes go months without meeting up. “With my job, it’s really difficult,” she says. “I have to drop everything if I get a role and it can be all-consuming. But when we can, we’ll meet for a drink – it’s lovely.”As children, Susan and Jo weren’t nearly as close. Susan was the third child of four and Jo the youngest, so she got away with a lot, Susan says. “My older brother was the only boy, so he could do no wrong, whereas I consider myself the middle child.” Their mother, a cleaner who worked night shifts at MI5, dressed Susan and her elder sister identically, despite their six-year age gap. “When she started to get too old for it, I thought, ‘Cool’ – but then Jo turned up and I had to match with her. Mum dressed us like little Victorian children.”Three-and-a-half years younger, Jo looked up to Susan. “I wanted to follow her everywhere, but on the handful of times she’d take me to her friends’ houses, I’d do something to annoy her – like ask too many questions,” says Jo.“She spoke gobbledygook for a long time, and I couldn’t make out what she was saying – I found her quite sinister,” laughs Susan.For a period, their mother worked at Peckham fire station and would occasionally take the girls to work with her. One of Susan’s favourite memories, she recalls, is of the firefighters letting them play with the hoses, and drenching each other with water.At school, Susan was the good girl, “smart and very together”, recalls Jo, whereas Jo herself was “forever getting into trouble or getting suspended”. During their teenage years, they argued a lot – about makeup, magazines or clothes. Their paths erged even further after a teacher advised Susan to audition for the National Youth Theatre.“After that, I knew my route quite quickly, whereas Jo was quite a difficult kid and it took her a bit longer to find what she wanted to do,” says Susan.Their relationship changed in the coming years. “I’m not especially close to our older sister, so I thought: ‘Be the older sister you would want.’ I started asking Jo how she was, what was going on in her life. I wanted to be the first person she would come to if she was having trouble,” says Susan.Jo had decided to train as a nurse, but halfway through her course, she became pregnant. “I was only 20 and we all knew my dad was going to be really cross, because he wanted me to finish uni,” says Jo.Their Nigerian father worked full-time in the Home Office, as well as having a weekend security job at the Royal Festival Hall. “He had that immigrant mentality of work, work, work,” says Susan, and he wanted his children to do well.“I didn’t tell him until I was over five months pregnant,” says Jo, “and I asked Susan to come with me.”Their father died after Jo’s son was born, and it was Susan’s encouragement that drove Jo to finish her nursing degree. “He always said he wanted me to go back and finish, and I had no intention of doing it, but Susan had just finished filming The Inbetweeners 2 in Australia and she said: ‘If you complete it by the summer, you can come with me to the premiere.’ I graduated and she took me with her, which was really cool.”Now, they message via WhatsApp almost every day, even when Susan is filming, and meet up in person whenever they can. “As I’ve got older I’ve realised she’s super-quick and super-funny,” says Susan. “Actually, she’s overtaken me in some ways – she’s got all these responsibilities, while I’m floating around auditioning or trying to write stuff. I’ve got massive respect for her.”The feeling’s mutual. “Susan’s always been very real and matter-of-fact,” says Jo. “When I was younger I didn’t quite understand – I just thought she was horrible! Now I realise she’s straight with me and that’s what we all lack in our lives. A lot of people tell us what we want to hear, but Susan’s not like that. Any advice she gives is always spot-on, and always in my best interests. She’s a really special person.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f91bebf7b4013fafbabd01fbaaa20a3394aab122/0_121_1799_1079/master/1799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cb6b8a168e6f3e64e4775c806950db","title":"chef tom oldroyd on his inspirational siblings and post polpo ventures","story":"Tom Oldroyd is one of London’s hottest chefs. We visit his Islington eatery along with his brother and sister – William and Olivia – for an overdue catch-up beer and lunchCreativity runs in the Oldroyd family. Chef Tom Oldroyd is known for his reinvention of classic European dishes, first at Polpo, where he was chef-director, and now at his own restaurant, Oldroyd, which he opened in Islington in 2015. His flair for imaginative thinking is a trait he shares with his siblings, William, a director whose 2017 debut film Lady Macbeth was Bafta-nominated, and Olivia, who manages exhibitions at the V\u0026ampA.“We’re all pretty similar, really,” says Tom, 36. “All three of us have followed our passions and we’ve been lucky enough to make them into our careers.”Their success means the pace of life is frenetic for all three, with each putting in long hours and William and Olivia often travelling for work. But the trio have remained remarkably close, making sure they carve out time to catch up with one another over a drink or a meal together.“Tom lives round the corner from me in Hackney, so when we can, we’ll pop to the local pub for a quick pint,” says William, the eldest at 38. “Olivia is in Shepherd’s Bush, so when we’re all in London at the same time, we meet for Sunday lunch at Tom’s restaurant.” Tom’s style of cooking is ideal for a big family get-together. “I love food you can pass around and make conversation about,” he says.If most siblings experience some degree of rivalry growing up, the Oldroyds insist that wasn’t the case for them. It’s not difficult to believe. They share a natural optimism, talk about one another’s achievements with obvious pride and say that, first and foremost, they’re friends. “We’re very supportive of one another, and we get on really well,” says Olivia, 35.With two years separating each sibling from the next, there were inevitable squabbles during their childhood, but they were always a tight-knit unit. They grew up in Guildford, in a house opposite their primary school, where their mother was a teacher. Tom called her “Mrs Mummy”. Credit for their lack of competitiveness goes to their parents, who encouraged each of them to pursue their own interests.“Will was always the most academic – he went to the local grammar school – whereas I had a short attention  and went to a state school,” says Tom. “But our mum and dad never pressured any of us to follow a particular path. They supported us in whatever we wanted to do. Will always had a passion for theatre and Olivia was always very artistic. I was looking for something creative, too.”William went to Durham University to study theology, but while he was there, he realised directing was his calling. After moving to London, he worked as an assistant at the Almeida and the Barbican before winning a directing residency at the Young Vic theatre and going on to stage productions around the world.Tom was initially unsure where his own passion would take him. “I always loved food, and watched Ready, Steady, Cook religiously growing up, but I didn’t want to be a chef,” he says. “I worked in hotels after leaving school and all I saw was chefs microwaving everything.”William and Olivia have vivid memories of Tom’s teenage experiments in the kitchen. “He went through a phase of making pea soup all the time, and it was delicious,” says Olivia. “He always had the knack of being able to open the fridge and make something simple but lovely out of whatever was in there.”It was after studying hospitality management as a mature student at Surrey University that Tom began working as a chef, getting a job at Alastair Little’s restaurant in Soho. When William went to eat there for the first time, he says: “I felt very proud to sit in a restaurant where Tom was cooking the food.” He worked his way up, then spent six months at trendy Italian restaurant Bocca di Lupo before being recruited as the head chef at Polpo, Russell Norman’s new venture, in 2009. As always, he included his siblings in his achievement.“I remember us going to his flat and him cooking us a sample menu on the small hob, because he’s always wanted our opinion,” says William. “Equally, I often think of Tom and Olivia when I’m working – what they’d like. It stops me getting too lost in what I like.”After her MA in history of art at Sussex University, Olivia joined them in London. Watching her older brothers work so hard to make their ambitions a reality made her more determined to fulfil her own. “Their work ethic is definitely the biggest thing I learned from them,” she says.In 2013, the trio began living together in a house in Shepherd’s Bush, where they were joined by Olivia’s boyfriend and Tom’s fiancee, Meryl Fernandes, an actress and television presenter. “People did think it was a bit weird that we all lived together,” says Olivia with a laugh. “But it was great. We have a similar sense of humour and we have fun together.” William would come to her for advice on his love life, while Tom taught her how to season her cooking properly. The arrangement lasted two years before Tom and William moved to east London. Tom now has a baby daughter with Meryl, who is overseeing the design of his new venture, a Hackney pub, The Duke of Richmond, where he’ll serve French dishes. Olivia is often out of the country preparing touring exhibitions and William is working on several early stage film projects.However busy life becomes, they’ll always make time to support one another’s projects. “They’re so talented,” says William. “It’s fantastic to see the outcome of their hard work.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f55d3da2540976c61e77b3b6c6021add3c3bce9/71_520_5799_3480/master/5799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49a534f4509d93d40770943ef81d969f","title":"surprise truce brokered by turkey and russia spares idlib for now","story":"Surprise initiative welcome respite for Syrian opposition and people of the provinceRelieved locals and rebel groups in Idlib have been trying to unpick details of an eleventh-hour truce that excludes much of the northern Syrian province from a Russian-led attack for at least one month and sets up a buffer zone intended to shield 3 million civilians.The surprise initiative, brokered by Turkey and Russia on Monday, assuages fears of an immediate widespread humanitarian catastrophe and sets the scene for a swathe of northern Syria to remain out of central government control indefinitely.The arrangement strengthens the role of Turkish-backed rebels in the northern province, and is likely to lead hardline groups to make a tactical retreat to southern Idlib where, for now, they will remain out of the sights of Russian and Syrian guns.The move is a welcome respite for Syrian opposition groups, who had feared a massive attack aimed at returning the final rebel-held province to central government control, allowing Bashar al-Assad to clinch victory in the seven-year war.As momentum built towards an attack, Assad’s backers, Russia and Iran, grew increasingly wary of the political price they would end up paying by bringing about a humanitarian crisis unlike any other in the Syrian war.Weeks of belligerent rhetoric from Tehran and Moscow had increasingly softened in recent days and been replaced by common ground with Ankara – a central backer of what remains of the anti-Assad opposition, which has increasingly muscled in on northern Syria and saw its own interests unravelling if chaos was ignited along its border.“Civilians in Idlib think this is a good deal, they feel hopeful and happy concerning it,” said Mahmoud Abbi, a spokesperson for Free Idlib Police, a rebel-backed local police force. “We are grateful for Turkey’s efforts to prevent the Russian and Assad attack on Idlib. However … we do not trust Russia about the deal. But for now it is better than displacement or bombing.“The deal is for Turkey’s security but it is also face-saving for Putin and by association Assad,” he said. “Iran refused to participate in this attack because of its own bad military and economic situation. The Assad regime is weak and has no ability to attack without the help of Iranian militias.”The Assad regime was not represented at the bilateral summit between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in the Russian resort town of Sochi, and not was it present at a trilateral summit with Iran in Tehran one week ago. The Syrian government had no immediate response to the development, which appears likely to consolidate Turkey’s presence in the north, giving Erdogan a stronger hand in managing the final stages of the war – and aftermath.Central to the truce is the removal of an extremist coalition from the buffer zone, the dimensions of which are yet to be finalised. Turkish and Russian intelligence officials will soon meet to thrash out the numbers of radical rebels required to leave the province. The agreement suggests that those who agree to exit will be given safe passage to the eastern Hama desert region.Jawad Abdel Karim, 40, a spokesman for the Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) umbrella group of hardline fighters, said his organisation is, for now, expected to retreat up to 7km (4.3 miles) away from the agreed demarcation point. Forces loyal to the Assad regime, meanwhile, would retreat 10km away. “Give or take, the distance between the opposition and regime will be 15km,” he said.The Iranian foreign minister, Mohammed Zarif, said he welcomed the apparent breakthrough, adding weight to a growing belief that the deal, or a variation of it, would hold. “Intensive responsible diplomacy over the last few weeks-pursued in my visits to Ankara and Damascus, followed by the Iran-Russia-Turkey Summit in Tehran and the meeting in Sochi-is succeeding to avert war in Idlib with a firm commitment to fight extremist terror. Diplomacy works,” Zarif wrote on Twitter.HTS, and earlier incarnations of it, has been a significant presence throughout Idlib for the past three years. It has been particularly strong in the south, but has attempted to impose austere theocratic rule in many towns and cities. The numbers of ideologically driven fighters in its ranks have been difficult to gauge. Thousands of men had joined the organisation because of its strength. But as its momentum wanes, the powerful group is starting to lose impetus in some parts of Idlib.While parts of Idlib appeared to rally behind the truce, not all were convinced that it would hold. “Although we agree with the points mentioned in the agreement between Erdoğan and Putin, have they ever got a result before?” asked Abu Wissam, 32. “Civilians on the ground are still living in fear and worry. We’re all hesitant and we’re all doubtful. And we have nothing to say any more. Our voices went hoarse with demands and no one listened.”Another Idlib local, Ahmed Hallaq, 34, said: We had bigger dreams and goals than this agreement. All of Syria should have been safe from the Assad regime and his militias, not just a buffer zone. Lots of my friends around here think the same. We don’t trust the regime, we have zero trust in its morals and promises. They violated most, if not everything else that’s been agreed on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/991d071dfea26331573c28d69ad07b004fd8d0de/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a547d218bcfa4849c3b43cbcd535fc","title":"venezuela nicolas maduro salt bae istanbul","story":"Opposition figures condemn Venezuelan president for visiting famed Nusr-Et steakhouse in Istanbul on way back from ChinaA viral video showing the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, feasting on a steak prepared by a celebrity chef at a time many in his crisis-racked nation are going hungry has provoked fury from opponents of the embattled socialist leader.Maduro visited the famed Nusr-Et steakhouse in Istanbul when he stopped over briefly in Turkey on the way home from a trip to China to raise investment.In the videos, he can be seen puffing on a cigar from a personalized box while he and the first lady, Cilia Flores, watch the owner, Nusret Gökçe, in dark aviator glasses and a tight black T-shirt, cut into a steak in flamboyant fashion.Gökçe, a world renowned restaurateur better known by his nickname “Salt Bae”, posted the videos on his Instagram account, which has 16 million followers. His other videos show him serving customers such as Diego Maradona and posing as Don Corleone from the Godfather movies.Gökçe later deleted the images and a thank you post to Maduro.But by that time the videos had already generated a maelstrom of criticism for Maduro, who was forced to put a lighter spin on the dining experience. Appearing on television on Monday night, Maduro called the meal a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” and thanked Gökçe for his hospitality, saying he hoped to see him soon in Caracas.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.“While Venezuelans suffer and die of hunger, Nicolás Maduro and Cilia are enjoying themselves at one of the most expensive restaurants in the world,” said Julio Borges, the exiled former president of the opposition-controlled national assembly.A deep economic crisis marked by hyperinflation and widespread food shortages has destroyed Venezuelans’ earning power, with many surviving on less than $1 a day. Nearly nine in 10 households are living in poverty, according to a 2017 survey by three leading universities.“Eating meat and smoking cigars … with the dollars that he refuses to use to buy medicines and food: WORKER PRESIDENT,” said former government loyalist Nicmer Evans, now a leader of the opposition Frente Amplio.A main course in Gökçe’s restaurant costs between $70 and $250 – equivalent to between two and eight months salary in Venezuela on the minimum wage.The Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio, a fierce critic of Maduro, piled on, noting that Gökçe also has a restaurant in Miami, home to the largest population of Venezuelan immigrants, most of them hostile to Maduro.Maduro has drawn closer to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as the two have become political pariahs in Washington and fallen under US sanctions.In July, during a previous visit to Istanbul, he dressed up as an Ottoman horseman while visiting the set of a popular Turkish TV series, Resurrection: Ertugrul, which the Venezuelan leader said he watches back home.“Chavismo is asking China to borrow money because you can’t pay your debts and then go to luxury restaurants,” the social media expert Luis Carlos Díaz wrote on Twitter in a broadside at Maduro’s leftwing populist politics adopted from late predecessor Hugo Chávez.This report includes material from the Associated Press and AFP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cf989ff8562ee1165adb5b04a210442463cb314/529_66_6797_4079/master/6797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=425e1ef0cb7b9f28a1b862cd7c67d3e3","title":"women of the world nomad games in pictures","story":"This year’s World Nomad Games, a celebration of nomadic heritage, took place in the Issyk-Kul province of Kyrgyzstan.

Higgins and his wife Sabina are pictured at the  National Ploughing Championships in Screggan, Co Offaly on Tuesday. Photograph: Tom HonanThe .Presidential candidates have descended on the opening of the National Ploughing Championships in Co Offaly, which more than 300,000 people are expected to attend over its three day run.Four of the five confirmed candidates visited the site in Screggan on Tuesday including incumbent Michael D Higgins, who officially opened the event.Mr Higgins and challenger Seán Gallagher met for the first time since the campaign began, with the two shaking hands at one point. Mr Gallagher said Mr Higgins had thanked him for “a kind note” he recently sent him.Speaking to reporters, Mr Higgins refused to discuss the election in detail, saying: “Today belongs to the ploughing. Today belongs to rural Ireland and the farmers.”Mr Higgins said he had “never run away” from a campaign in his life and that he had “answered questions for about 30 or 40 years in relation to campaigns”.“I’m looking forward to it,” he said of the election campaign.Asked if he would take part in televised debates with his opponents, Mr Higgins said his campaign team would hold discussions on the issue soon.“Let the campaign be about real issues and let it be dignified,” he added.Mr Higgins’ speech at the opening ceremony focused on the challenges faced by farmers including climate change and Brexit. He said the family farm model “is of vital importance to the future of our country and to the future of our rural communities”.He said there is a responsibility never to abandon these families “to the cruelty of market forces”. Mr Higgins said his wish for rural Ireland in the year ahead was that it would be a time without a death in a farming accident.Mr Gallagher, whose support was put at 15 per cent in a weekend poll to Mr Higgins’ 67 per cent, said he received a great reception from the public at the ploughing, which he called a “celebration of the very best of Ireland”.He said people were telling him it was time for something new and fresh and that he was not seeking to be Mr Higgins’ replacement but rather a successor.The former Dragons’ Den panellist said Mr Higgins was an “inspiration to me and many people around the country”.Asked why he is running if he believes Mr Higgins is such a capable leader, Mr Gallagher responded: “It’s about laying out the vision for the next seven years. I think our future is about being forward focused and forward looking.”He said he intends to run a positive campaign but reaffirmed his position that he is against any debates which Mr Higgins does not take part in.Gavin Duffy, a businessman and Dragons’ Den panellist, who was at 6 per cent in the Sunday Business Post poll, also said he was against taking part in debates without Mr Higgins.“It’s not a debate without the incumbent.”He said all the candidates have questions to answer, including Mr Higgins on the issue of presidential expenses.Asked about promises made by other candidates to take a reduced presidential salary or no salary at all, Mr Duffy said the role should not be only for well off people who can afford to do it for free.He said the majority of people approaching him at the event promised him their vote. “It’s taken more than an hour to come more than 200m.”Mr Duffy accepted he faces an uphill struggle but said “we’re ready to meet that challenge”.Senator Joan Freeman, who was at 3 per cent in the poll, said she has been a regular at previous National Ploughing Championships in her role as founder of suicide prevention charity Pieta House.Asked about her low standing in the poll, Ms Freeman said “it’s early days” and noted that Mary Robinson was at one per cent at one stage during the campaign she eventually won in 1990.She said Mr Higgins should take part in the debates as it was “seven years since people have heard him”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3633030.1537294306!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter casey secures place on ballot for presidential election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Casey is the sixth candidate confirmed to contest  the presidential election. File photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Three people who have served as panellists on the Dragons’ Den TV series will be on the ballot paper for next month’s presidential election after businessman Peter Casey won the backing of a fourth local authority. Mr Casey, a Co Derry born businessman, was endorsed by Tipperary County Council and Limerick City and County Council on Tuesday, adding to the support he had secured from councillors in Clare and Kerry on Monday. His is the sixth name confirmed on the ballot paper for the election along with Dragons’ Den panellists Seán Gallagher and Gavin Duffy, Senator Joan Freeman, Sinn Féin’s Liadh Ní Riada and the incumbent, President Michael D Higgins. Four of the six candidates have won the backing of four local authorities with Ms Ní Riada nominated by Sinn Féin members of the Oireachtas and Mr Higgins able to nominate himself as the office holder. The election takes place on October 26th and nominations close on September 26th. In Tipperary, Mr Casey won the support of 13 councillors while journalist Gemma O’Doherty was backed by eight. He was backed by a mix of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and independent members. “I’m so excited to get, now, into the race proper,” Mr Casey said after the vote. “I thought it would work out this way, I was the last person into the race and I knew I would be the last one to get over the line. It’s a big relief. I can go to the ploughing competition tomorrow and relax.”Ms O’Doherty said she intended to seek the support of the remaining councils. Longford County Council is expected to decide later if it will nominate a candidate while councils in Donegal, South Dublin, Kildare, Louth and Monaghan are yet to back anyone. Offaly and Laois councils decided not to nominate anyone on Monday and Kilkenny County Council defeated a motion to nominate Ms O’Doherty by seven votes to five.During his pitch in Tipperary, Mr Casey spoke of the importance of reaching out to the diaspora as there are more than 70 million people worldwide who call themselves Irish.He also emphasised the importance of education and referred to Ireland’s past reputation as “the island of saints and scholars,” adding: “I want to relight that educational fire”.Mr Casey reiterated his view that the president’s expenses should be made public, that a president should not be allowed to nominate himself or herself for re-election, and that the presidency should have a five-year term with elections taking place at the same time as local authority elections. Ms O’Doherty told councillors she “would worry about the fact now that we have three businessmen going forward into this race, with pretty much the same track record”.She also told councillors that her concerns include free speech, a free press, homelessness, healthcare, truth and justice. “We do not have a free press in Ireland and this is deeply damaging to democracy. There are influences now within Irish society which threaten free speech and threaten press freedom.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"typhoon mangkhut lashes the philippines with 200km h winds","story":"  September 15, 2018Relief as casualties far lower than officials feared storm heads towards southern China   September 16, 2018More than 2.4 million people evacuated in southern China\u0026rsquos Guangdong province "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3632416.1537209711!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"are prospects for brexit backstop deal as promising as london suggests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNews reports have been hinting at a new flexibility on the part of EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to give Theresa May a break on how to deal with the problem of maintaining a frictionless border on the island of Ireland. Photograph: Facundo ArrizabalagaEPAAnother false dawn? Or are prospects for a Brexit backstop deal as promising as some in London suggest? Can this week’s Salzburg summit really see a breakthrough?News reports have been hinting at a new flexibility on the part of EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier to give Theresa May a break, a new willingness, supposedly, to embrace British proposals on how to deal with the problem of maintaining a frictionless border on the island of Ireland.But there’s a strong element of “pot-half-full-or-half-empty”, wishful thinking emanating from London, and a glossing over of the essential principle of the EU position – still firmly maintained by Barnier – that Northern Ireland will have to be treated separately from the rest of the UK. That it is a case apart.That is what the UK has been resisting strenuously because of the implication, as the DUP sees it, of a “border” on the Irish Sea. The UK alternative is for the whole of the UK to maintain sufficient regulatory alignment with the EU to make separate treatment for Northern Ireland unnecessary.The problem is that such a solution would entail serious “cherry picking” of EU single market rules, a prospect adamantly opposed by the EU 27. Except, they say, in respect of the “small” territory of Northern Ireland in the interest of safeguarding the peace process.Barnier has for weeks been trying to “de-dramatise” the commission’s proposals to make its solution palatable and politically unthreatening to unionists by making it clear that the EU has no ambitions to change the constitutional position of the North.He gave a lengthy explanation of his views on September 3rd at the Commons Brexit committee.“We are ready to simplify these checks, to have them carried out at a number of different places and have checks, thanks to technical means, which could take different forms,” he told MPs.Controls on the flow of goods or animals and animal products, don’t have to imply a political border, or be on a border, he said. They already exist on the Irish Sea for agricultural products.And regulatory controls to ensure goods going into Northern Ireland comply with single market rules might happen at ports, on ships, or even at the factories where the goods are produced.The commission has even embraced a willingness to look at British proposals, suggested last summer and known as “MaxFac”, or “maximum facilitation” as part of the solution – trusted trader schemes, technological monitoring of goods movements, and special arrangements for small, border businesses.“We need to see how and when and where these controls would take place,” Barnier told the Commons. “They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland, they could be done using technological means, they could be dispersed, as I said, or simplified in technological terms.“Just to make that absolutely clear, we are not talking about a border. We are talking about controls. Some of these controls are already carried out in Northern Ireland on products coming from Great Britain. For example, plant-health checks, veterinary checks, animal checks.”Among the reassurances apparently given to London, the Financial Times claims, is that they could all be handled by UK customs officials without requiring EU officials in tow.Although the commission negotiating taskforce – and indeed the Irish, most vociferously – had previously insisted that the MaxFac measures would not be adequate to guarantee the integrity of the single market and police a UK-EU border regime, it appears that there is a willingness in Brussels to consider them as part of a Northern Ireland backstop solution.The commission, in effect, is turning the tables on the UK, calling its bluff: “You like MaxFac? Fair enough. Now let’s try it out on our backstop . . . these are your proposals and they certainly minimise any requirement for a hard border. Which is what you say you want.”But, critically, the commission remains adamant that its willingness to bend or circumvent single market rules can only apply to Northern Ireland. London still has to bite that bullet and shows no inclination to do so, and certainly not ahead of Thursday’s Salzburg summit. Irish officials, moreover, remain confident that the meeting will see, if anything, a reinforcing of the strong political support by the 26 for Ireland’s position.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The Brussels meeting comes on the eve of a major summit in Salzburg, Austria, on Wednesday. British prime minister Theresa May will use that gathering to make a direct pitch to fellow leaders to back her isive Chequers proposals.UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said it was time for the “compromises” made by the UK to be “matched on the EU side”.In a sign that Brexit talks could go to the wire, the European Union is preparing for a final deal to be struck at an emergency summit in November, rather than the scheduled October meeting previously targeted by both sides in the negotiations.The deal has to be finalised well in advance of the UK’s March 29 2019 exit from the bloc so the parliaments in Westminster and Strasbourg can sign off on the agreement.Arriving at the Brussels meeting on Wednesday, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said: “If we are to get a deal there has to be compromises from both sides and we look forward to seeing what the EU side has to say about this.”The message echoed that from Mr Raab, who set out the UK’s position in an interview with journalists from newspapers across the EU.Setting out the UK’s hopes, Mr Raab said the Salzburg meeting at which Ms May is expected to briefly set out her position over dinner on Wednesday night before her 27 counterparts consider the situation in her absence on Thursday, would be “an important milestone” and “a stepping stone” to a deal.But he made clear the UK was looking for further movement from the EU on the Irish border.He branded Mr Barnier’s “backstop” proposals — which would see Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs area — unworkable, because they would create a border in the Irish Sea and fail to respect the constitutional integrity of the UK.“What I’m not going to do is to say that I would refuse to entertain any further proposals that the EU comes up with but they’ve got to be respecting the equities that we’ve set out,” he told correspondents from European newspapers including Germany’s Die Welt, France’s Le Monde and The .In a high-profile Panorama interview on Monday, Ms May framed the decision facing the country as a choice between her deal or no deal.But with large numbers of Tory hard Brexiteers openly rejecting the Chequers plan, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the scene was set for a second referendum.Sir Vince told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I think growing numbers of people — we are already seeing it from senior Labour people and a few Conservatives — will say that the only way forward is to take this back to the public and say: ‘Do you accept what Theresa May has negotiated or would you rather stay in the European Union?”’A demonstration at the Labour conference in Liverpool on Sunday will add to pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.But Mr Raab rejected talk of a second vote, saying: “Even if that’s what people want to do, it’s difficult to see how it could be done in time, and we wouldn’t facilitate it.”European Council president Donald Tusk said he wanted to avoid the “catastrophe” of a no-deal Brexit.In a letter to EU leaders he said they should discuss arrangements for the “final phase” of the Brexit talks “including the possibility of calling another European Council in November”.He said the EU leaders should also reconfirm the need for a “legally operational backstop” on Ireland to avoid a hard border.Mr Tusk added that leaders should work on “limiting the damage” caused by Brexit.“Unfortunately, a no-deal scenario is still quite possible. But if we all act responsibly, we can avoid a catastrophe.”–Press AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Russia blamed Israel on Tuesday for the loss of a military IL-20M jet to Syrian fire, killing all 15 servicemen on board. Photograph: Nikita ShchyukinAFPGetty ImagesRussian president Vladimir Putin moved to ease tensions after a dangerous row erupted between Russia and Israel on Tuesday over the accidental downing of a Russian military plane in the Syrian Mediterranean.Fifteen Russian servicemen were killed when an Ilyushin-20 reconnaissance aircraft was caught in the crossfire of Syrian missiles fending of an attack by Israeli fighter jets air late on Monday night.Russia’s defence ministry blamed Israel for the disaster on Tuesday, warning it had the right to retaliate. However, Mr Putin signalled willingness to absolve Israel of responsibility, saying the Russian aircraft appeared to have been the victim of “a chain of accidental circumstances”. “As regards any retaliatory action it will be above all directed above all at additional security measures for our servicemen and infrastructure in Syria, ” the Russian president told a press conference after talks with Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, in Moscow. Israel admitted its F-16 bombers had conducted strikes targeting weapons facilities in Syria’s Latakia province that it said were preparing to supply arms to the Iranian backed Hizbullah militant group. But it said responsibility for the attack on the Russian aircraft lay with the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and its Iranian backers. In a telephone conversation with Mr Putin, Binyamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, offered to send his air force chief to Moscow to share information about the incident. Mr Netanyahu also noted that Israel was determined to prevent Iran from establishing a military stronghold in Syria that could be used to transfer armaments to Hizbullah for use against Israel. The United Nations special envoy for Syria called on Russia, Syria and Israel to “refrain from military actions” in the wake of the downing of the Il-20. Staffan de Mistura warned that any military response would “exacerbate an already complex situation” in Syria. Russia’s defence ministry began recovering the remains of servicemen and their possessions amid the wreckage of the stricken Il-20 some 27km off the coast of Syria’s Latakia province on Tuesday. Eight vessels were conducting the search with the help of unmanned underwater technology.The aircraft disappeared from radar late on Monday night while preparing to land at a military base in the region that Russia has been using since intervening in the Syrian conflict almost three years ago. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defence ministry spokesman, said Israeli F-16 fighter jets had deliberately used the Il-20 as cover against Syrian missiles system while conducting the air strikes. “The Il-20 has an effective reflecting surface in order of magnitude greater than that of the F-16,” he told reporters in Moscow. Israel had also failed to give Russia timely warning of the attack on Syria that could have averted the incident, he said. “As a result of the irresponsible actions of the Israeli military, 15 Russian servicemen were killed, which is absolutely not in the spirit of the Russian-Israeli partnership.”However, Israel said Syrian government forces had failed to check whether any aircraft were in the area before launching defence missiles. All the F-16 jets involved in the attack on Latakia province were back in Israeli airspace before the Russian aircraft was shot down. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said the tragedy would not impact on an agreement announced by Russia and Turkey on Monday to establish a demilitarised zone along the line of conflict in Syria’s Idlib province, one of the last remaining strongholds of rebels fighting the Assad regime.The United States said the unfortunate downing of the Russian aircraft underscored the danger of “tragic miscalculation in Syria’s crowded theatre of operations”.The incident, it said, was also a reminder of the urgent need to resolve the Syrian conflict in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and end Iran’s provocative transit of dangerous weapons systems through the country."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/18/TELEMMGLPICT000174976848_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"must remember british oskar schindler frank foley now ever","story":"The Duke of Cambridge with the new statue of Frank Foley in StourbridgeIt was an understated tribute to a thoroughly modest hero.

It\u0027s important and interesting and you\u0027re interesting, it\u0027s putting them in the context of the world.He added: The idea of having a photograph exhibited here, for a child, it will be amazing.I remember when I was five years old and I had a painting of mine exhibited in my local library and the fact that other people see what you do, or that you can visit yourself and say I\u0027m at the Tate Britain, it\u0027s going to make an amazing impression on them.The Tate directorial team in the Duveen Galleries: Frances Morris (Tate Modern), Alex Farquharson (Tate Britain), Maria Balshaw (Tate Director) and Francesco Manacorda (Liverpool) and Anne Barlow (St Ives)Every London primary school is now invited to register at tateyear3project.org.uk to choose a date and time for a Tate photographer, briefed by McQueen, to visit their school and take the class photo.Children who cannot take part for safeguarding reasons will still be included, with classroom learning resources to help them explore the themes of belonging, identity and citizenship. Artangel will also create an outdoor exhibition of class photographs across each of London\u0027s 33 boroughs and Tate Modern will stage a major survey exhibition of McQueen\u0027s work to coincide with the project, open from February to May 2020.It will be one of the most ambitious projects to date for McQueen, who has directed films Hunger, Shame, 12 Years A Slave and his latest film Widows, and who won the Turner Prize in 1999.Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain, said that putting on such an exhibition in 2018 “is very complex, with safeguarding in place, with consent needed from every parents, with the data protection act”.He added: “Through advocacy, through publicising the idea, through coming up with the right partnership and team structure, we’ve come up with the infrastructure and plan to make it happen.”Please review our commenting policyScotland does not need separate immigration system, migration report findsComment: Putin wants to claim the victory in Syria – but he needs to watch out for his old ally Iran Stormy Daniels claims Donald Trump offered to cheat for her on The Apprentice as she reveals intimate details of alleged affairJohn Swinney told to \u0026#39listen and learn\u0026#39 on primary one testing as he heads for Holyrood defeatMinisters\u0026#39 speeches to be shortened so more women MPs can be heardBritish priest arrested for allegedly fondling Italian woman on train in RomeStrictly Come Dancing 2018: Debbie McGee on trusting your partner and what they all really think of the training videosNo-deal Brexit will make it harder to bring foreign criminals to justice, police leader warnsGermany removes spymaster from his post over far-right violence rowDuchess of Sussex will prepare for Commonwealth tour with first solo outing to art exhibition World leaders urged to commit to ending scourge of TB How popular is Donald Trump?

There needs to be a clear responsibility for these children, and accountability for their educational outcomes.”Labour would also like to close a funding loophole that\u0026nbspallows schools to receive funding for pupils before they are counted towards exam results – as they say it creates a window in which pupils can be off-rolled without consequences for the school.Ms Rayner added: “We must all take responsibility for our must vulnerable children, and that is why we will be reforming the accountability system to support them, while working with schools to move towards a system that is cooperative and does not drive workload, and giving them the resources they need to support all their pupils.“That is why Labour will close the loopholes and end the perverse incentives. This will ensure that there is no unintended reward for so-called off-rolling and give schools an investment in ensuring that excluded pupils move on to the best possible provision.”\u0026nbspAs Labour made the announcement, the headteacher of the school featured in TV series Educating Greater Manchester resigned\u0026nbspafter allegedly being accused of\u0026nbspdeliberately “off-rolling” students.Drew Povey, who was executive head\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspHarrop Fold School, criticised the council\u0026nbspfor taking a “heavy handed” approach\u0026nbspwhen they suspended him in July over what he deemed to be administrative errors.In a post on Twitter, Mr Povey said\u0026nbsptwo to three pupils had been incorrectly coded as “off-roll” – but he insisted\u0026nbspthe school did not gain financially and\u0026nbspit had a “negligible” impact on exam results.Salford Council\u0026nbsprefutes the allegation that the suspension was\u0026nbspa “personal vendetta” against Mr Povey.UK news in picturesCar manufacturer BMW announced on September 18, 2018, that its Mini factory in the UK would close for its annual summer maintenance several weeks earlier than planned, starting on April 1, 2019, to avoid any disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit.It\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower.

Despite some promising studies over the years, many do not make it beyond the confines of the research lab.According to Professor Paus, however, his latest discovery is “not far at all” from being applied in a clinical context for hair loss.“Sandalore is already offered as a cosmetic product in Italy by the company that has co-sponsored the current study,” he said.Now, the researchers have a larger scale, professionally-controlled clinical trial underway, and they expect to see results by the beginning of next year.Dr Nicola Clayton of the British Association of Dermatologists, who was not involved in the study, said: “It is a fascinating concept that the human hair follicle, as the authors put it, can “smell” by utilising an olfactory receptor.”She said the group’s data was “very exciting”, although noted that from clinical perspective she could only speculate about the extent to which such a treatment would improve outcomes for patients.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/15/rtx3f3yg.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1810  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/11/15/rtx3f3yg.jpg","title":"no deal brexit honda cost car maker swindon jaguar land rover","story":"Created with Sketch.Japanese motor giant employs 4,000 people at Swindon branch, where Civic model is producedClick to followThe IndependentThe motor industry has been warning of the Brexit fallout for monthsNo-deal Brexit would cost Honda tens of millions of pounds, car maker warnsA no-deal Brexit would cost Honda tens of millions of pounds and make it more difficult to bring necessary parts from Europe into the UK, the car maker has warned. The company said, however, it remains committed to its Swindon operation, which employs 4,000 people. The group uses millions of parts sourced from other EU countries at the Swindon plant, where the Civic is manufactured, and said a no-deal Brexit would create a “significant” burden in terms of bringing parts into the country, as well as delivering cars to the rest of Europe. Ian Howells,\u0026nbspHonda Europe’s senior vice president, told the BBC: “We’d probably be looking at something like 60,000 additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get products to and from Europe.”He added: “If we end up with WTO tariffs, we’d have something like 10 per cent costs in addition to our shipped product back into Europe and that’d certainly run into tens of millions.“And likewise\u0026nbspwhen we’re looking at componentry coming the other way, again tens of millions in terms of tariffs potentially coming into the UK.”This would have an impact on productivity and competitiveness, Mr Howells said, particularly up against European rivals. However, the Swindon plant is the only place where the Civic is produced, so it would be a “very big decision to take a different approach”.

Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, last week warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/16/15/scarface.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6535661  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/16/15/scarface.jpg","title":"sean penn me too movement salacious divide men women today programme nbc the first","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027I think it’s too black and white,\u0027 says actorClick to followThe Independent CulturePenn appeared on the NBC’s Today programme alongside his co-star Natascha McElhone to promote their new TV show The First Sean Penn claims \u0027salacious\u0027 Me Too movement ides men and womenSean Penn has claimed the #MeToo movement ides men and women, calling it “suspicious” and “salacious”.The two-time Oscar-winning actor – who has previously criticised the movement\u0026nbspagainst sexual harassment and assault – argued it lacked nuance and was “too black and white” in its approach.Penn made the comments during an appearance on NBC’s Today programme alongside his co-star Natascha McElhone, the pair promoting their new TV show The First which follows a team of astronauts as they race to become the first humans to visit Mars.Host Natalie Morales asked if #MeToo – which exploded last autumn after a series of sexual misconduct allegations were made against powerful men in Hollywood and a number of other industries – has “informed” the show and its characters, including several female astronauts and a US\u0026nbsppresident who is a woman.Sean Penn suggests some women could have lied about #MeToo allegationsSean Penn replies to haters of his book: ‘I’m 57 and my pool’s heated’‘Cloaked in crazy’: Sean Penn’s debut novel ripped apart by critics“I’d like to think that none of it was influenced by what they call the movement of\u0026nbsp#MeToo,” Penn replied. “I think it’s influenced by the things that are developing in terms of the empowerment of women who’ve been acknowledging each other and being acknowledged by men.”The 58-year-old added: “This is a movement that was largely shouldered by a kind of receptacle of the salacious”.“Well, we don’t know what’s a fact in many of the cases,” he said after Morales asked him to explain what he meant. “Salacious is as soon as you call something a movement that is really a series of many inidual accusers, victims, accusations, some of which are unfounded.

And even when people try to discuss it in a nuanced way, the nuance is attacked.”After Morales asked Penn if the\u0026nbsp#MeToo movement had grown too big, he said: “I think it’s too black and white. In most things that are very important, it’s really good to just slow down.”In spite of Penn’s comments, McElhone said the cast spoke about the movement “a great deal” on set.“I think what Sean was maybe alluding to is this sort of bubble of actors or people who are in magazines that have gotten a lot of attention from this,” she said. “Of course, it’s terrific that they’ve put a spotlight on it. But now, it’s we need to go to the places where this is happening behind closed doors, and it’s not exposed and those voices aren’t being heard.”Penn, who has starred in films Milk, Mystic River and I Am Sam, criticised the #MeToo movement back in May – telling  it was “led by mania”, “not intellectually honest”, and filled with “self-aggrandisement and venting”.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/18/11/istock-855434066.jpg","title":"children air pollution school run playground health toxic vehicle emission","story":"Created with Sketch.Unicef\u0026nbspestimates that one in three children are growing up in towns and cities in the UK with unsafe levels of particulate pollutionClick to followThe IndependentChildren carried personal monitors which recorded black carbon over a 24-hour period during weekdays to assess their exposure on an average school dayChildren are most exposed to dangerous air\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspon the school run and\u0026nbspin the playground, experts have warned.While children\u0026nbsponly spend 40 per cent\u0026nbspof their time on the school run and at school, they receive 60 per cent\u0026nbspof their exposure to tiny particles of black carbon during those times, a study has found.Peaks in children\u0027s exposure to the\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspwere recorded while they travelling to and from school and during breaktime when they were likely to be in the playground, the report by Unicef UK and Queen Mary, University of London showed.Exposure to the pollutant, which can penetrate deep in the lungs, bloodstream and potentially the brain, and can stunt lung and brain growth and cause long term breathing conditions, is generally higher at school than when children are at home.Amy Gibbs,\u0026nbspUnicef\u0026nbspUK’s director of advocacy, said: Every day, thousands of children across the UK are setting off on a toxic school run that could impact their life and contribute to serious\u0026nbsplong-term\u0026nbsphealth problems.We cannot afford to continue to overlook this invisible but serious threat change is possible if the government acts now.It is critical that it sets out a clear strategy with sufficient funding to protect children from the harmful effects of toxic air, when and where they are proven to be most at risk.UK news in picturesIt\u0027s either my deal or no deal, the Prime Minister has said to the BBC\u0027s Nick Robinson in an interview on Panorama that airs this evening.

Whether it\u0027s burning only the cleanest fuels at home or leaving the car at home on the school run, everyone has a role to play in reducing air\u0026nbsppollution\u0026nbspand protecting the health of our children.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/18/14/The-boot.jpg","title":"pub cash payment uk first the boot freston ipswich suffolk","story":"Created with Sketch.The Boot no longer has tills so customers have to pay either by card or through their phoneClick to followThe IndependentThe Boot pub in Freston near Ipswich, SuffolkA traditional pub in the Britain has stopped taking cash payments and is the first in the UK to do so, its landlord has claimed.\u0026nbspThe Boot in Freston, near Ipswich, no longer has tills and customers have to either pay by card or through their phone.\u0026nbspHaving been derelict for nine years, the 1530s pub was refurbished by landlord Mike Keen, who has now opted to go cashless.\u0026nbspMr Keen said there were many benefits, most notably lower insurance premiums as cash is no longer kept at the premises.\u0026nbspWhy is Wetherspoons banning dogs from its pubs?Wetherspoons bans dogs from all their UK pubs as of todayHow Guinness became an authority on world recordsHe said some delis had gone cashless and at least one bar in Manchester, but no traditional pubs before The Boot.Cash has always been a pain.

We must change that.”\u0026nbspTurning his attention to Brexit, Sir Vince said: “The Brexit date may be 29 March, but it is only a maybe. Brexit is not inevitable. It can and it must be stopped.”He called on Theresa May to “shock us all” by offering a second public vote on any deal she should return from Brussels with, but said it would be “far easier for Jeremy Corbyn to be brave on Brexit”.“This is his big chance,” he said. “He used to be the campaigning backbencher who joined us in opposing the Iraq war and defending civil liberties.\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march“In his new role he has kept his hands clean and his image polished by hiring hard left bootboys and girls to do his dirty work.”Sir Vince continued: “If Jeremy Corbyn will not say ‘I will support a People’s Vote and I will fight Brexit’, Labour members should wave him goodbye. He is currently letting down the many people in Labour’s heartland who now see Brexit for what it is.”Lashing out at the hardline Brexiteers, he accused them of ignoring\u0026nbspyears of “economic pain” to justify the “erotic spasm” of withdrawing from the European Union.\u0026nbspBrexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union In the speech, Sir Vince also said that he does not accept that it “is some form of racism to want immigration to be managed like other parts of the economy” but said the public had to realise that it has not depressed wages.\u0026nbsp“I have personal experience of racism,” he told the party faithful. “I embarked on a mixed marriage in this country when racism was rife. My wife and children were being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood.\u0026nbsp“And I was thrown out of the parental home. So I will never waver in my commitment to call out and stand out racism in all its forms.”But, he added: “We must understand that to dismiss all Brexit voters as racists is simply wrong and utterly counterproductive.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/01/10/16/nadine-dorriesv23.jpg","title":"nadine dorries islamophobia muslims benefits multiple wives muslim council britain mcb","story":"Created with Sketch.Conservative Party urged to take action over tweet, which was\u0026nbspdeleted after 11 minutesClick to followIndy PoliticsTory MP Nadine Dorries has been accused of “callousness” after posting a link online to a\u0026nbsp10-year-old story about Muslims claiming benefits for multiple wives.The MP for Mid Bedfordshire shared a post on Twitter from\u0026nbspa supporter of the far-right anti-Islam party, For Britain, which suggested Muslim\u0026nbspmen in polygamous marriages can receive state handouts for each of their wives.Ms Dorries\u0026nbspposted\u0026nbspthe tweet - which included a link to a story from 2008 in the , with the headline \u0027Muslims can claim benefits for several wives, say Ministers\u0027.She accompanied it with\u0026nbspthe comment:\u0026nbsp“Ministers, are you having a laugh?”, before deleting it\u0026nbsp11 minutes later.Why is Theresa May silent about Boris\u0027s burqa remarks?May condemned for silence on Islamophobia after Johnson commentsConservatives accused of \u0027turning a blind eye to Islamophobia\u0027Islamophobia \u0027very widespread\u0027 in Tory Party, says Baroness WarsiDespite being\u0026nbspaccurate at the time of publication\u0026nbspin 2008,\u0026nbsp the story no longer\u0026nbspapplies under the current benefits system.\u0026nbspTen years ago, a husband and a wife\u0026nbspcould claim out-of-work benefits as a couple, while additional spouses would receive a separate amount which\u0026nbspwas less than the single-person rate.Under the existing\u0026nbspuniversal credit system, polygamous relationships are not recognised and any additional partners each have to claim as a single person.\u0026nbspPolygamous marriages are not common practice in the UK and it is currently illegal to marry more than one person.It is, however, accepted if the marriages have taken place in a country where the practice is legal.

His measured comments erged from an earlier, furious response.\u0026nbspIn the early morning, the Russian Defence Ministry intimated the plane had been hit\u0026nbspby Israeli or French fire. Later, spokesmen changed the story, accepting the plane had been shot down by the Syrians. But\u0026nbspthey ratcheted up the diplomatic fury.\u0026nbspIn quick succession, Moscow said Russians had died as a result of Israel’s “irresponsible actions.” It blamed the Israeli command for giving just a minute’s advance warning of its air strikes. It accused their pilots of using the larger Il-20 plane as cover during missions. It summoned the Israeli ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Smolenskaya Square and it gave Israel’s defence minister a public dressing-down.\u0026nbsp“The actions of the Israeli defence ministry do not reflect the spirit of the Russian-Israeli partnership,” Sergei Shoigu, the\u0026nbspRussian minister of defence\u0026nbsptold Israeli opposite number, Avigdor Lieberman. “We reserve the right to take further steps.”\u0026nbspThe fierce response suggested a difficult period ahead for Russian-Israeli relations.\u0026nbspUntil that point, cooperation between the two countries had been close. In May, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended Victory Day celebrations in Moscow in\u0026nbspa symbolic gesture at the height of the Kremlin’s international isolation. Russia also seemed to accept Israel’s strategic interests in the region.\u0026nbsp“There was a lot of trust between the two sides,” said Yuri Barmin, an expert at the Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday. “It was seriously undermined today.”The incident brought back memories of November 2015, when a Turkish fighter shot down a Russian Su-24 jet that had violated Turkish airspace. Russia retaliated with sanctions and seven months of hostile relations\u0026nbspensued.Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone –\u0026nbspwith Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds. That, of course, is the source of the problem\u0026nbspSome of Russia’s more excitable politicians suggested\u0026nbspMoscow could respond\u0026nbspby supplying\u0026nbspDamascus with more advanced C-300 anti aircraft systems – a kind that would prove more problematic for Israeli planners.\u0026nbsp“Russia simply can’t let this drop,” said Franz Klintsevich, member of the Russian senate’s Defence Committee.\u0026nbspBut the likelihood of a serious military response from Russia was always low. Even if it wanted to, Russia does not have the capacity to close Syrian air space to Israeli jets.More fundamentally, it was never going to wade into the undeclared war between Israel and Iran.\u0026nbsp“Russia will not stand in the way of Israeli operations to stop Iranian expansion, knowing how existential they are seen in Jerusalem,” said Jonathan Spyer, research fellow at the Jerusalem Institute of Strategic Studies. “Moscow is trying to be friends with everyone – with Assad, Israel, Turkey, the Kurds.\u0026nbspThat, of course, is the source of the problem.”\u0026nbspRussia-Turkey deal over buffer zone in Idlib met with scepticismUN warns of ‘worst humanitarian disaster’ of 21st century in SyriaRussia ‘resumes airstrikes’ on Syria’s Idlib despite Trump warningIn his afternoon comments, Mr Putin urged\u0026nbspagainst a direct comparison to the Turkish Su-24 incident. That was an intentional strike he said this was “an accident.”\u0026nbspThe president’s unexpectedly\u0026nbspmild response brought into question how much of the initial show of anger against Israel was real – and how much a tactic of\u0026nbspdeflection\u0026nbspfrom a military that had made mistakes.“Russia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems,” said Vladimir Frolov, a security expert and former Kremlin advisor.\u0026nbspThere were\u0026nbspother, more obvious questions to be asked. How was it that communication with Syrian allies broke down? How could an anti aircraft system mistake a large reconnaissance plane for a fighter jet?Part of the answer lay in the technology, suggested Justin Bronk, a research fellow at RUSI, an international defence and security think tank based in London.\u0026nbspDesigned in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, the Syrian S-200 surface to air missile unit is not a failproof system, he said. Without newer fire control and radar systems, it would have had difficulty differentiating between the two planes.A lax approach to firing the missiles may also have played a role.\u0026nbsp“During recent attacks, the Syrians have tried to give their public an impression of having effective defences,” said Mr Bronk. “So they have fired missiles blindly – on simple ballistic trajectories, or at least with very weak firing solutions. That may have contributed.”In a statement released on Twitter, the Israeli Defence Forces said the blame for the incident lay “firmly with the Syrian regime,” which had fired missiles “indiscriminately” in response to Israeli\u0026nbspairstrikes.\u0026nbspRussia understood it has only itself to blame for not making sure the Syrians had the right friend-or-foe identification systems\u0026nbspBut the statement also expressed “sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane”.\u0026nbspThat show of humility may have given Mr Putin enough to move on.\u0026nbsp“The operational dynamic may change slightly, but the politics can’t change,” added Mr Barmin. “Russian doesn’t have so many allies that it can throw one of them\u0026nbspunder the\u0026nbspbus.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/21/un-1.jpg","title":"putin erdogan syria idlib sochi russia turkey talks","story":"Created with Sketch.Gathering is second in 10 days for the Turkish and Russian leadersClick to followThe IndependentBattle for Syria\u0027s last major rebel bastion on hold as Putin and Erdogan meet to discuss next movesThe leaders of Turkey and Russia are meeting in Sochi on Monday for hastily arranged talks\u0026nbspover the fate of Syria’s last major rebel stronghold.For now the impending\u0026nbspoffensive on Idlib province, touted for weeks by Damascus and its Russian and Iranian backers, appears to be on hold as a result of Turkish diplomatic agitation and military manoeuvres.Turkey is struggling to prevent an onslaught by pro-Damascus forces on the rebel-held Idlib province, but its moves may have also escalated the potential dangers of the conflict.“We will continue our efforts with Iran and with Russia,” Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at a press conference in Islamabad late last week. “We will continue our efforts on international platforms as well.”In recent days, Turkey has begun fortifying positions in Idlib ahead of the Russian-backed Syrian government offensive. Turkey\u0026nbsphas amassed armoured vehicles, artillery guns, and tanks along the border with Syria, with some equipment moving across the frontier, according to Turkish news outlets and video footage posted to the internet.It has transferred arms and ammunition to its Free Syria Army (FSA) rebel allies, pro-Ankara newspapers reported, though some experts say the distribution of weapons won’t affect the outcome of any conflict. \u0026nbspIdlib province on 11 September in anticipation for an upcoming government forces offensive (Getty)Turkey has also begun to bolster a dozen outposts it operates in and around Idlib with additional troops and military vehicles.

But Turkey’s moves have upped the geopolitical cost of any attempt to take Idlib by the pro-Assad camp that includes Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as well as Iraqi Shia militias backed by Tehran.Around three\u0026nbspmillion Syrians live in Idlib province, a hilly agricultural region by\u0026nbspthe Turkish border. Many of the displaced have resettled in the province from other parts of the country or were forcibly relocated there from opposition enclaves recaptured by Damascus.Turkey, the primary patron of the Syrian opposition and the host to 3.5 million displaced Syrians, has vehemently opposed the regime offensive to retake Idlib. The US and Europe have urged a political solution over Idlib and warned against the military campaign. US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley repeated warnings that any use of chemical weapons by the regime would trigger a response by Washington.The UK on Saturday warned of an impending humanitarian crisis amid reports of attacks on hospitals and clinics in rebel-held territory. “The UK has been clear that a man-made catastrophe in Idlib is entirely avoidable,” Alistair Burt, Middle East minister, said in a a press release. “We support the urgent diplomatic efforts being made by Turkey and the UN.”Ankara worries in part that another bloody confrontation in Syria could flood Turkey and Europe with hundreds of thousands of fresh refugees.Airstrikes in in Idlib, northwestern SyriaAlready, thousands of displaced Syrians have relocated from the southern edges of Idlib and northern Hama province to the Turkish-controlled Afrin district adjacent to the border, said a source in Afrin. On Friday, Turkey hosted a meeting of French, German\u0026nbspand Russian officials ahead of a possible meeting of those countries’ leaders over Idlib.In addition to a possible confrontation between pro-Assad forces and Turkey, Idlib could be the flashpoint for a conflict with jihadi forces that dominate parts of the province. In recent days, al-Qaeda’s international supporters on social media have also blasted fellow jihadis in Idlib for allowing Turkey to dispatch armoured vehicles and trucks carrying tanks into Syria, as depicted in videos posted on social media.A 13 September statement signed by 15 prominent al-Qaeda supporters questioned Hayat Tahrir\u0026nbspal-Sham (HTS), the jihadi group that is a dominant player in Idlib, for granting Turkey access to the province.Mr Oliver suggested Turkey could be bolstering the observation points for fear of attacks by jihadis as well as to stymie Damascus’s offensive. “The internal problems for Idlib are huge,” he said. “We are talking about an area that has FSA factions, HTS, you have Isis\u0026nbspcells, you have other small entities.”For now Turkey’s moves have complicated plans to retake Idlib. Syrian civilians have begun to mass around the bolstered observation points in hopes that they won’t be struck by government and Russian warplanes. Thousands of Syrians who have fled the attacks of the regime and Russia are settling in the areas where the Turkish army\u0027s military posts are, because they think it is safe, the pro-government Vatan newspaper reported, publishing photos showing people purported to be sheltering near the outposts.On Friday, for the second week in a row, thousands of Syrians in the province took to the streets in peaceful, colourful demonstrations that recalled the first months of the 2011 uprising against the Assad family’s decades-long dictatorship. “For the time being, everything is postponed,” Mr Oliver said. “There is no final agreement and no final disagreement.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/Fox-rspca-nature-1019267.jpg","title":"fox nature car RSPCA hertfordshire","story":"The poor fox was trapped in the car for 12 hours  (Image: RSPCA)These are the scenes as an RSPCA animal rescuer carefully pulled the irascible fox to safety by using a grasper to winkle it out of the front grille.Vets had alerted the animal welfare charity when the driver turned up asking for help to save the fox.RSPCA animal collection officer (ACO) Amy Reiter today described how the fox was none the worse for its ordeal, although was far from in the mood to make its release easy when she went into action in the Wilbury area of Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire.She said: \u0026ldquoThe lad had hit a fox during the early hours of the morning and thought it went under his vehicle.

Angela Merkel on collision course with voters on new immigration planWith immigration adding one million to our population every three years this simply cannot go on.He also warned that the loose definition of high skilled labour in the report means \u0026ldquothese proposals would permit continued high levels of immigration, including those with medium skills from all over the world.He added: \u0026ldquoThe overall outcome would be to weaken immigration control rather than strengthen it.The report was drawn up after ministers asked experts to carry out an in-depth analysis on the patterns and impact of migration from the European Economic Area in July last year to help them draw up proposed new rules for after the implementation period ends in December 2020.High skilled migrants should be able to easily fill vital roles in the UK (Image: getty)The Migration Advisory Committee\u0027s (MAC) final report says that, if immigration is not part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future system in isolation, there should be no preference given to EU citizens.It says: A migrant\u0027s impact depends on factors such as their skills, employment, age and use of public services, and not fundamentally on their nationality.The committee emphasised that it was not expressing a view on whether immigration should be part of the negotiations.MAC chairman Professor Alan Manning said: If - and this is not an MAC recommendation - immigration is not to be part of the negotiations with the EU and the UK is deciding its future migration system in isolation, we recommend moving to a system in which all migration is managed with no preferential access to EU citizens.

But these proposals don\u0026rsquot go far enough.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would publish a white paper soon after the MAC\u0027S findings are released.

The German chancellor said: We will continue to depend on foreign professionals. Companies should not be leaving the country because they can\u0027t find staff.                Angela Merkel REJECTS AfD claims she ENDANGERED German citizens                 EU summit: Silent CLASH as Merkel REFUSES to discuss refugee limitsShe added many entrepreneurs were more concerned about hiring skilled workers than getting tax relief.The new law, to be discussed by Mrs Merkel and her cabinet this month, aims to attract workers from outside the European Union.They will, however, need a professional qualification and German language skills when applying for a work visa, according to a paper drawn up by officials.Many in government will see this as a game-changer in the global race for talent, since other countries are espousing stricter immigration rules. But it could anger voters who feel left behind after Mrs Merkel\u0027s decision to welcome more than a million refugees in 2015.German chancellor Angela Merkel (Image: )An opinion poll this month showed 51 percent felt her government did not take Germans\u0027 concerns about immigration seriously. In eastern Germany, the figure was 66 percent.The unprecedented 2015 influx of asylum seekers, mainly from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, caused a great deal of public anger.Deep isions became apparent last month in the eastern city of Chemnitz, which saw violent far-right protests after migrants were blamed for the fatal stabbing of a German man.Referring to Chemnitz, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union, Merkel\u0027s Bavarian sister party, described migration as the mother of all political problems in Germany.

Heres what you need to know.After a marathon session of talks at Chequers on July 6, Theresa May managed to secure a Brexit plan which will be assessed by the EU.Her Brexit plan will see the UK remains closely tied to the Brussels.It also includes the creation of a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a common rulebook.This rulebook could limit the UKs ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize.Mrs May has agreed to an amendment that would stop Britain being tied to Europes customs union after we quit the EU.In dramatic scenes in the House of Commons on July 17 2018, Mrs May managed to see off a damaging attempt, winning by just six votes.Mrs May was then defeated on a separate amendment to her flagship Trade Bill, which will require her to seek continued UK participation in the EUs system for regulation of medicines after Brexit.Now her Cabinet is required to ensure that the UK can continue to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency.Mrs May hopes to get an agreement hammered out at a series of summits with EU leaders this autumn, and bring it back to Parliament for approval.A deal on the UKs withdrawal agreement was expected to be agreed in time for the summit in October, along with a statement from both sides on the future relationship.However, a number of senior figures have said this deadline may slide into November.Once a dead has been agreed, MPs will be asked to approve it.In a Panorama interview in September 2018 she said MPs had a simple choice between her Chequers plan or no deal.She told the BBC current affairs programme: I think that the alternative to that [the Chequers plan] will be not having a deal.The former Foreign Secretary claimed Mrs Mays disastrous plans for the Irish border would leave Britain at a loss.Boris Johnson said the European Unions fallback position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland was annexed by Brussels.Opposition to the plan in the Conservative Party centres around the European Research Group of hard - Brexit supporting MPs led by Jacob Rees - Mogg.His voice had been among the loudest voicing their objection to the plan and he urged MPs “chuck Chequers”.Up to 80 Tory MPs are prepared to vote against Theresa Mays Chequers plan, Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister and ERG backer has warned.A group of about 50 Tory MPs have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported.Also voicing his opposition to the Chequers deal has been former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.He said Theresas Mays had wrapped a suicide vest around the British constitution and handed the detonator to Brussels.Along with former Brexit secretary David Davis and Mr Johnson resigned in protest following the Chequers meeting.Several other MPs also quit their ministerial posts over the issue, including Steve Baker, Maria Caulfield, Ben Bradley and Robert Courts.The party will vote down any Brexit deal brought back from Brussels by Theresa May, according to shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry.The Corbyn ally said the party will oppose it to try to force an election by Christmas.Speaking to the FT she said a deal which meets her party’s tests was “not going to happen”, and therefore the Prime Minister would be forced to quit.Without the support of the opposition party, it would need just a handful of Tory rebels to vote against her to see it defeated.Theresa Mays initial plans brought her on side with those Conservatives who favour a soft Brexit.The Prime Minister has also been seeking grassroots Tory support for the plan.Among those voicing support for the Prime Minister has been Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who was a prominent member of the Leave campaign.He said he was confident that the Prime Minister will go into the Conservative Party conference and beyond, securing a good Brexit deal for Britain and continuing to ensure the country enjoys good economic growth and we take advantage of Brexit.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000434904044.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside the tiny island of mirrors where 100 pairs of twins live one in every three families and no one knows why","story":"Thats because Alabat, home to just 15,000 people, is home to more than 100 pairs of twins.Right now, 78 are non-identical and 22, including four-month-olds Gian and John, look exactly the same.Those two lads are the youngest while Eudosia and Antonia, 86, are the oldest, MailOnline reports.And just to trick people into thinking there might actually be a glitch in the Matrix, many dress the same.Antonia, who married when she was 19, said her husband had a clever way of telling them apart.She said: In the initial days my husband would often mistake Eudosia for me.There were some embarrassing moments when my husband made amorous overtures to my sister thinking that it was me.I then showed him that I have a mole on my nose while my sister does not have one. That solved the problem.The number of twins on Alabat may even have gone up in the last few years.In 2013, Transterra Media reported around 60 of them on the island.At the time, the mayor said four per cent of the islands 12,039 residents were twins.He and his we were shocked to find so many on the island when they migrated there in the 1980s.A historic study found a 182 per cent increase in multiple pregnancies in 35-year-old women between 1996 to 2006 due to the use of fertility drugs.But this could not have influenced Alabat, a remote island which did not have access to the medication.No scientic studies have been carried out to find out why there is such a high ratio of twins on the island."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004330278421.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"may must walk tall in the mountains sell brexit","story":"On Wednesday night in Salzburg, Austria, she will have a chance to try to persuade other EU leaders to bite on her plan for Britain’s future relationship with the bloc.The next morning EU leaders will meet without her, to decide on their response. May needs them to say or, preferably, do something that shows her plan is making headway and is a realistic way forward.“The Government has got to show that it is making some progress,” admits one leading Cabinet minister.No one in Downing Street is expecting a dramatic breakthrough at this summit, though.Theresa May told the Cabinet this week that Salzburg would be a “staging post” on the way to a deal.The British hope is that on Thursday, the EU will announce a special November meeting to discuss Brexit. That, combined with the October EU Council, should provide time for a deal to be done.But, in a sign of how the timetable could slip further, one Downing Street figure close to the negotiations has told influential Europeans that  a deal was done in December, the Government could still get it through parliament in time for Brexit day.Others in No10  are insistent that the withdrawal agreement needs to be done by November. What May needs to judge though is whether the EU is serious about engaging with her Chequers plan or not.Influential Cabinet ministers are worried that the EU will never formally kill off Chequers but will not ever really take it seriously. Then at the last, May will be left with only two options when it comes to  getting a withdrawal agreement.She would either have to leave Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU — a ision of the UK that May has repeatedly said is unacceptable.Or, sign the whole of the UK up to a customs union with the EU, which she has, again, said she does not want to do as it would deny Britain an independent trade policy.If she does not want to take either of these bad deals, she would be left with No Deal.The Government still hopes that the member states, who are accountable to their electorates for the consequences of no deal, will tell the Commission to be more flexible as the clock ticks down.  But Chequers, which was sold to the Cabinet on the basis it was “negotiable”, has not yet made the progress many in Government hoped it would.If this does not change soon, it will be time for Mrs May to change tack. At the same time, the Government must step up its preparations for le outside the EU.“Project After” is looking into how Britain can benefit from the freedoms it will have once it has left. But ministers tell me that it “needs more work”.This should be a priority for the Government. For Brexit does not guarantee this  country’s success or failure.  It is what we do after Brexit with our new-found  flexibility that will ­determine that.The Government must be ready to seize this moment.PHILIP HAMMOND has twice had to be slapped down by the Chief Whip in Cabinet this week.On Tuesday, he talked about how there would be a lot of “squealing” about universal credit. Julian Smith, the chief whip, then picked him up on his language.He said that talking about “squealing” doesn’t help. .Those sympathetic to Hammond say that he was talking specically about Labour when he used the word “squealing”. But it is another reminder of his political tin ear.Then on Thursday, Hammond raised the prospect of delaying Brexit day. After the ­legislative timetable for getting ready for “no deal” – which is tight –  had been outlined, Hammond pointed out that the Government has the power to put the Brexit date back.But doing this would be politically explosive.No one else present supported Hammond’s point and the chief whip shot it down, saying they would get all the legislation through in time.Theresa May then explicitly ruled out delaying Brexit day. Allies of Hammond say that he was only talking about an administrative pause of a few weeks.They argue that he only made the point after Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, raised concerns about there not being enough parliamentary time to get everything in place.But Any delay in exit day would cause a massive political crisis. No10 ­sources are adamant that there is “zero chance” of Brexit day not being March  29, 2019.But there is a major problem for the ­Government when the Chancellor, one of the three most senior figures in it, has such a political tin ear that he raises the prospect.This date would make things all too easy for the Government’s critics. It would be “The Zombie ­Budget”, “Hammond’s ­horror show”, “The bloodsucking Budget”.So, a Halloween Budget is out. No final date has yet been agreed for it. But the aim is for the Budget to take place before the special November EU Brexit summit.The Government does not want to risk the Budget ­getting caught up in the row over Theresa May’s ­negotiating position.So keen is the Government to keep these two events separate, there is even talk of breaking with tradition and possibly ­holding the Budget on a Monday .WHILE Boris Johnson has been keeping up a regular verbal barrage against Theresa May’s Chequers plan, she has not given it the hard sell.There has been no national tour, no fireside chat with the country or impassioned speech.But next week, Theresa May will try and make the case for her plan in an extended interview with Panorama. The BBC show was even allowed to film the start of Thursday’s “no-deal” Cabinet.Number 10’s view is that most voters don’t know what the Chequers plan means. They think that a lot of those who are hostile to it, particularly on the Tory side, are more aware of the row over it –  and particularly the resignations of Boris and David Davis – than the details of the plan.If the Prime Minister  though is going to persuade sceptical voters of the merit of her approach, she needs to admit that something has changed and explain why.It won’t work  she simply says she’s stuck rigidly to her red lines.Instead, she needs to ask voters to put themselves in her shoes, to under­stand why she has made the trade-offs that she has.Mrs May must treat the electorate like grown-ups.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In his very first disastrous Budget he tried, and failed, to raise National Insurance for self­-employed strivers. Has he learned? No.Now he intends to scrap a tax cut for White Van Man and a scheme helping hard-up Brits to start a business. He is plotting to hit drivers with the first fuel duty rise in years. And not content with taxing fizzy drinks, he targets the  CUPS.One sneaky grab after another, from people already struggling.

The next it’s sugar. Then carbs. A few weeks later, sugar is back on the naughty step.It’s the same with alcohol. Until recently, a glass of wine a day kept heart attacks at bay. Last month, we learned that NO amount of alcohol is safe. Then this week our new goal, apparently, should be two teetotal days a week.It’s hard to keep up — and no wonder many people ignore all the reports. Who wants to be told what to do by a bunch of scientists who can’t make up their mind?But the latest news from Public Health England should give us all pause for thought, because British women now have some of the lowest le expectancies in Europe.Girls born in the UK today can expect to die three-and-a-half years earlier than girls in Spain, the country that comes out top in this report. The reasons? Rising levels of obesity and poor cancer survival rates.British women also fare badly when it comes to premature deaths — defined as before 75.Many are caused by cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes, which are linked to smoking, alcohol and junk food.France, home of Michelin star chefs, is also way down on the list. And so is Italy.My supporting evidence is that I live with an Italian, who would be more likely to attend a funeral in a jester’s hat than eat a bag of crisps.Clearly, we all need to take a leaf out of the same book.The prevailing wisdom is that it’s more expensive to eat healthily. But that’s not true.A recent report from the Institute of Economic Affairs shows it’s possible to have your five-a-day for less than 30p — and a nutritious,  plain, diet can be bought for less than £1 a day.Meanwhile, the cheapest adult meal in McDonald’s is about £4.50, for which you could make a fresh vegetable curry for the whole family.So it’s not about money. Why, then, do us British women fare so badly?I wonder  we are so daunted by images of women airbrushed to perfection, in adverts and on social media, we feel we can’t compete. So we give up, eating what we like and not exercising.Because keeping really fit takes serious work.The latest insight into this is from movie star Mark Wahlberg who shared his daily schedule this week.He’s in bed by 7.30pm then up at 2.30am for the first of his two daily workouts. His fitness schedule only allows for two hours’ “work” a day — and thus it becomes clear his job is, in fact, his physique.Since most of us spend at least ten hours a day working and commuting, you can see why it’s often easier not to bother.But it’s not just our health that’s in peril. It’s also that of our children, for whom we are the primary role models.Not about vanity, but good healthI have evidence in the form of my best friend, who is a marathon-running exercise junkie — as is her daughter.I, on the other hand, although not proud of this fact, do no exercise — and my daughter doesn’t enjoy it as much as her friends.Getting fit and losing weight can feel impossible.But look at Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who this week announced that he has lost 7st and put his Type 2 diabetes in remission, which is pretty inspiring.So let’s choose to make this bad news story into a positive and use it as inspiration for change.Let’s aim for two booze-free days a week.And maybe ditch the biscuits for a bit and make some other small, sustainable changes that will leave us able to go for a brisk walk without fearing a heart attack.This is not about vanity, it’s about good health. Because the alternative is sobering.When it started off 18 years ago it was innovative and exciting TV. But now it’s degenerated into a hotbed of fame-hungry wannabes pitted against each other and behaving horribly as a result.Now it’s been axed. About time, too.I BELIEVE in people’s right to protest – of course – against political views they disagree with. But, Ian Bone, the protestor who assailed Jacob Rees-Mogg and his children on their own doorstep has crossed a line.“Your daddy is a horrible man,” Mr Bone told Mr Rees-Mogg’s bewildered-looking children, who will likely be traumatised by the incident – and will certainly not forget.MPs are already putting a lot on the line to serve their country. Many endure threats of violence or even death – and just look at what happened to Jo Cox.Yes, it’s fine to disagree with politicians and to protest. But taking it out on children and trying to make them feel bad about their father is bullying behaviour that is wholly unacceptable.Speaking to LBC afterwards, Mr Bone, who is 71, said that he saw no problem with involving children in his protest.But despite being happy to bring Mr Rees-Mogg’s offspring into the argument, he refused to speak about his own five children, and repeatedly refused to answer  he would have been happy for them to be treated in the same way.Talk about hypocritical.EVERYONE praised as progress the BBC’s “solution” to the inequality on comedy panel shows, which has been to ensure there is at least one woman on every show.But then we hear from Sandi Toksvig that their contributions are often edited out.The QI host told the Radio Times: “There are panel shows that struggle to get women on, and that’s because . . . in the edit they are often seen just laughing at the boys and not saying anything at all, even though I know for a fact in the recording they were clever.”Turns out that turning up and being funny isn’t quite enough,  you are a woman, to be given the same air time as men. How annoying.MY Woman of the Week award goes to Carol Vorderman who, at 57, is clearly in her absolute element and loving le.She looks healthy and oozes confidence, especially in these skin-tight jeans.She told ITV’s Lorraine this week she’s happy being single and is not looking for a “keeper” or another intense relationship.In fact, she said she “couldn’t think of anything worse”.How refreshing. And what a great role model she is for women in their fties and beyond.WATCHING the video of a homeless man being sprayed with paint in Middlesbrough made my blood boil.The poor man – who was found dead just days later in a cemetery – is filmed sat against a wall, covered in paint, as a man brags: “This is how we dealwith the beggars on the street.”This disregard for another human being’s dignity is obscene and the yob should be made to volunteer helping homeless people.Until he sees that dehumanising this man who had hit troubled times was the lowest of the low.DID you see Madonna’s daughter, 21-year old Lourdes hitting the runway for the Gypsy Sport Spring Summer 2019 showcase at New York Fashion Week?It’s so dispiriting, isn’t it, that the headline news about her appearance, which could have focused on so many dferent things – her incredible confidence, for one – was that . . . she hadn’t shaved her legs, top.I guess true equality will have been achieved when a woman’s hairy calves go unmentioned and are seen as neither here nor there.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is no legal obligation to pay anything at all.This has been established by the House of Lords and no credible authority has questioned their Lordships.If we pay £40billon we must get something clear in , not just wishy-washy promises.Taxpayers would be outraged  it were otherwise.Any agreement on immigration must be examined with great care.We will doubtless be told that free movement has ended but, as Shakespeare wrote, “what’s in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet”.There ought to be no preferential terms for new arrivals from the EU above those offered to other nations and no access to state benefits.There must be a clear dferentiation in their rights after we have left and admission must be subject to a work permit scheme focused on skilled rather than unskilled labour.The solution to the Irish question is a further area where Brexiteers must be alert. Last week the European Research Group, which I chair, produced a paper explaining how it could be answered on the EU’s terms.Obviously the UK could simply say that there will be no physical infrastructure at the border but  instead we examine what the EU does on its other borders, and see  those precedents could be followed, then no reasonable person would think a “hard” border were necessary.So far the inevitable attacks on our reports have been mere rudery. No one has found fault with facts.If Ireland were used to justy the major concessions the Government is giving then we would know the deal is a bad one based on a false premise.It would be better than any other which the EU has so far agreed but Ireland is supposed to make it impossible.The issue has been used by those who are fearful of leaving the EU to keep us bound by its rules and regulations.Inevitably these complex machinations have led to some gossip about the leadership.These stories come from all wings of the Party with pro-Europeans such as Tom Tugendhat and George Freeman suggesting it is time to move to a new generationHowever, it is worth remembering the Prime Minister’s virtues.She is determined, thorough and dutul, and in my view duty is an heroic virtue.This gives her great strength and without a clear Parliamentary majority it is not obvious that anyone else could steer the negations to a conclusion.Pitt the Younger was hailed as the pilot who weathered the storm.

Nobody wants it.But this self-described “bloody dficult woman” believes she alone can ram it through.Either she knows something nobody else does . . . or her fabled “polished turd” is about to hit the fan.On tonight’s BBC’s Panorama, Mrs May spells out the formula she thinks propelled her to the top: “You bide your time and you are bloody dficult when it really matters.”Others fear a dferent characteristic has defined her political career, especially as Home Secretary.“She is mulishly stubborn,” says a former ally.“Once she digs her heels in, nothing can sht her — right or wrong.”They fear she will stick defiantly to her half-baked plan until she runs out of road and is forced to choose between an EU fudge or defeat in the House of Commons.The Chequers deal is flawed by the fantasy we can follow an EU rule book on free trade and regulation while reserving the right to duck and e.Outside Cabinet, Tories on all sides — Brexiteers and Remainers — insist it is unworkable.“It fails to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade,” writes ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith.“We would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.”EU negotiator Michel Barnier fears it endangers the whole EU project, which is already threatened by tensions over mass immigration, the Euro and jobless school leavers.Special treatment for the UK would instantly trigger demands from other member states for their own tailor-made deals, unravelling the drive for ever-closer union.Mrs May claims there is no alternative to Chequers.But there has to be — and Britain is already working on it.Despite Chancellor Phil Hammond’s blundering interference, preparations for a clean break are in train, covering everything from free trade to the vexed border with Northern Ireland.It may be pitched as a last-ditch option, only to be deployed in an emergency.But since Chequers is universally seen as a non-starter, free trade automatically becomes the only viable plan on the UK table.New Brexit minister, karate black belt and rising star Dominic Raab, is making this vividly clear in Brussels.He alarmed Downing Street by threatening to withhold the EU’s £40billion ransom  they push us too far.And he has told Barnier to do his own dirty work and impose a border in the Irish Sea  he dares.This is music to the ears of Tory MPs who desperately yearn to see some fighting spirit.They hope against hope Mrs May secretly has a cunning plan, ready to roll out at the right moment as she suggests, calling Barnier’s bluff.But there is another red card on the table, face up and flashing danger to our EU neighbours.Do they want to humiliate the PM to the point where she is defeated in Parliament and pushed into a second catastrophic election?EU leaders can read the polls which put Labour in front.They will also be horried to see ex-Tory vice-chairman Jeffrey Archer unhelpfully saying he would vote for Corbyn  he were a Northerner.And we should all be alarmed by David Cameron’s Goldman Sachs-trained Treasury minister, Jim O’Neill, saying: “I find myself struggling to be that scared by the prospect of a Corbyn government.”The EC has enough on its plate with the growing explosion of anti-Brussels populism across Europe. The last thing it wants any time soon is a hard-left Labour government led by lelong EU-haters Jeremy Corbyn and Marxist Chancellor John McDonnell.It might be the one bargaining chip that makes Michel Barnier blink first.For a Bank of England governor, his forecast of a 35 per cent crash in house prices verged on the hysterical.Project Fear has lost the power to shock, but it won’t stop trying.Aircraft will not fall from the sky, the Channel Tunnel will stay open, NHS patients will not starve or die from lack of NHS drugs.Not only have Carney’s nightmare scenarios of slump and mass unemployment proved false, the reverse has happened.Young workers are flocking to the UK for jobs. Wages are rising. Growth is strong.Now we see French companies such as Chanel stampeding to invest billions here.

And the influx continues.Latest statistics show the number of migrants who settled here in the year to March 2018 was 614,000, equal to a city bigger than Bristol. Net migration was around 270,000.Yet the revolution has been imposed by the ruling elite without any consent. No British citizen was ever asked to vote for this upheaval. No major party ever sought a mandate to open our doors.This helps to explain why the British public has such profound distrust in MPs on the question of immigration, as revealed in a major new opinion survey published this week.In the biggest consultation of its kind, involving 20,000 interviews, just one in six people showed any faith in the Government to tackle migration, while only 13 per cent felt that politicians are “open and honest” about the issue.These findings are not the result of bigotry or prejudice. Britons have been remarkably tolerant in the face of change.Indeed, that shines through the survey, which discovered that 65 per cent of people believe migrants bring valuable skills to the economy and the public sector. Similarly, 59 per cent think that ersity benefits our national culture.But British decency has been exploited by the political class to implement its agenda, with the result that disillusion is now widespread.People are rightly fed up with politicians who indulge in denial and deceit about the reality of mass immigration.A classic example was the phoney claim from the last Labour Government that, when the former communist countries of eastern Europe joined the EU in 2004, just 13,000 of their citizens would come to the UK. In fact, more than a million did.Even worse has been the attempt, particularly by the Left, to suppress open discussion by hurling accusations of racism against critics of mass immigration.A climate of censorship now prevails where public figures are expected to parrot the fashionable orthodoxy, and ordinary citizens are afraid to voice their concerns.Yet the anxieties of the public are all too genuine. Immigration has imposed more strain on our civic infrastructure, reflected in the shortage of affordable housing, the never-ending NHS crisis, the growth in the welfare burden and dficulties for parents in finding school places for kids.The import of cheap foreign labour has meant lower wages and job insecurity. Just as disturbing is the erosion of solidarity because of this upheaval.Social cohesion cannot exist without real integration, as the public recognised in the survey.The majority of respondents, 88 per cent, agreed with the idea that “migrants should learn English” and 85 per cent believe that migrants “should share our values”.But the multicultural ideology, which has long been the creed of the state, works in the opposite direction.It encourages migrants to cling to the practices and languages of their native lands, fuelling ision. As does the institutionalised acceptance of sharia law, which arguably offers more protection to men than women, undermining the traditional concept that we are all equal before the law.The consequences of multi-culturalism are seen at their most corrosive in the failure by the state to tackle serious crimes perpetrated by ethnic minorities, such as the organised abuse of girls by mainly Asian gangs in places like Rotherham and Derby.More concerned to uphold the illusion of cultural ersity’s success than to protect victims of crime, the police and other authorities indulged in a cover-up. It was only exposure of the abuse by journalists that finally forced them to act.That mix of official dishonesty and paralysis only undermines our society. There is a lesson for us from Europe, where the political order is threatened by growing public anger over immigration.In 2010, German Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that “this multi-cultural approach has failed.” But she did nothing to reverse the policy. Instead, she opened the door even wider, especially in 2015 when she allowed in more than a million migrants.The crime that followed has led to public outcry.Britain has always been renowned for its avoidance of extremism. But we will avoid the same fate only  the state adopts a new approach on immigration, including more political honesty, tighter border controls and an emphasis on British values.That is not racist. As the public knows, it is a recipe for greater harmony.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU has to know that she is unafraid to walk away  need be.What does her blundering Remainer Chancellor do?Volunteers his own apocalyptic warning about No Deal reversing our progress since the 2008 crash.Mr Hammond has leapt on the IMF’s latest doom-laden predictions and swallowed them whole, despite its abysmal forecasting record over the financial crisis, austerity and the Brexit vote.The Chancellor has already hampered vital No Deal preparations, undermined the new Brexit Secretary and only last week suggested delaying our departure.Now, at a stroke, he has sabotaged our negotiating hand and boosted the EU’s.It is a measure of the weakness of Mrs May’s position after the loss of her majority that Mr Hammond is still in his job.REMEMBER Brussels mocking the Brexiteers’ idea of high-tech customs checks to solve the Irish border problem?The technology didn’t exist, they said. It was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.Triumphant Remoaners piled in. It proved Brexiteers were clueless, they chirped. And Downing Street then ­produced its convoluted alternative.Except the EU, in the form of Michel Barnier, now believes in the fantasy island unicorn model too.

some sunk deep in the permafrost soil - aim to extend research by Russian scientists who are already working closely with South Korean specialists hoping to restore extinct species. Yakutsk is capital of diamond-rich Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia,  where 80 per cent of finds of samples of Pleistocene and Holocene animals with preserved soft tissues have been made.The scheme of the new centre will be unveiled at the 4th Eastern Economic Forum hosted by Putin opening on 11 September in Vlaostok. It will “aim to study extinct animals from living cells - and to restore such creatures as the woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, cave lion and breeds of long-gone horses”, reported The Siberian Times.The cloning scientists are already using DNA from the ancient animals has been preserved in remains encased in frozen soil - or permafrost - for tens of thousands of years. The centre will be based at Russia’s Northern-Eastern Federal University  which is seeking further investment for the extraordinary project.   Expert Dr Lena Grigorieva - who drafted plans for the centre - said: “There is no such unique material anywhere else in the world.”But scientists would also explore ways of helping fight human diseases, she said. “We study not only Pleistocene animals - another line is the study of the history of settlement of the North-East of Russia,” she said.  Northern ethnic groups have a unique ancient genetic structure. “Such studies will help in the study of rare genetic diseases, their diagnosis, prevention.”The university has existing close cooperation with South Korean SOOAM Biotech Research Foundation, led by cloning expert Professor Hwang Woo-Suk.There are also links between Russian scientists and trailblazing Hard University geneticist Professor George Church who plans to inset woolly mammoth genes into an Asian elephant embryo by 2020.Prof Church has revealed to Sun Online how a cloning project was on the verge of being able to grow a baby mammoth in a lab.His team of leading Hard scientists have been using DNA recovered from a woolly mammoth found perfectly preserved in ice in Siberia after dying 42,000 years ago.By merging genes from the mammals with that of elephants their species may be resurrected.The team are set to publish in the coming weeks scientic papers laying out in detail their revolutionary technique in creating and implanting mammalian embryos.Speaking to exclusively to Sun Online, Prof Church said: “We have already revived dozens of genes and are testing them in elephant cells.“We are focusing on a reviving mammoth genes and making a mammoth/elephant hybrid and help them spread to vast wild, arctic climates.”Using a genetic engineering technique called CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing, his team of scientists can “cut and paste” strands of DNA into elephant stem cells with a precision not seen before, paving the way for a woolly mammoth embryo. Prof Church said he wants to then grow a hybrid woolly mammoth/elephant hybrid within an articial womb rather than using a female elephant as a surrogate mum. It is estimated this will take at least 22 months.The prof believes this will allow woolly mammoths herds to begin once more plodding about the arctic and while doing so save the world. Along with other measures, its hoped the woolly mammoths will create an environment which could stop Siberias permafrost melting and then releasing billions of tons of greenhouse gases.The doomsday scenario has been dubbed as the “methane bomb” because  it happened it would dramatically worsen climate change, melting the ice cap and flooding countries across the world.And there is clear evidence that this is already happening.Bubble like mounds have been popping up like a geological plague and some have already burst and spewed out toxic gas which damages the atmosphere.But the worst of this ticking time bomb has yet to happen. Much of the methane is still trapped underneath by the permafrost layer which is fast disappearing and threatens to release the gas at any moment. An area where this is starting to happen is the Yamal Peninsula. Shocking aerial footage has revealed thousands of methane-filled craters — which threatens to happen across Russia’s frozen far north.Ironically, melting ice here revealed preserved woolly mammoths that are now being used in the cloning attempts.And  the huge furry mammoths/elephant hybrids were to be brought into being, Prof Church said they could repopulate these freezing wastelands and help lock in the lethal fumes. He said: “Cold-resistant elephants would flatten the insulating snow and supporting trees in winter and favour the highly heat reflective grass in summer.Should Prof Church and his Hard uni team successfully clone woolly mammoths they would be taken to an extraordinary Ice Age safari park currently being developed by Russian scientists.Called the Pleistocene Park, the 20,000 hectare zone in the furthest stretches of remote Siberia has been created in a bid to recreate an Ice-Age ecosystem. Boffins believe grazing woolly mammoths would also compact the snow in the winter and grass in the summer all of which lowers the permafrost temperature.In a previous interview, park director and scientist Nikita Zimov told Sun Online: By the time mammoths will be cloned,  theyre cloned and brought to the park, we will have a system.Theyll eat shrubs, break down shrubs. Theyll trample down the grass, eat the grass. The park is to show animals can transform the vegetation.If the park, which is already populated with bison, horses, moose, reindeer and muskox, is successful it will be expanded across the north in areas where there is a risk of mass methane release."},{"url":null,"title":"brits take to twitter to share windy memes as storm helene batters uk with 70mph gales","story":"Forecasters issued severe weather warnings  – but online wind-up merchants were quick to joke about the conditions.The storm obviously passed some by and they shared photos of single deck chairs and wheelie bins knocked over to poke fun at the predictions.Others who clearly felt the brunt of the gusts tweeted pictures of a businessman holding onto iron railings for dear le and a cat clinging to a tree.But while tweeters made light of Storm Helene, the Met Office said Britain is set for further wind and rain.Storm Ali will bring 85mph gales and an amber weather warning when it hits tomorrow. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004310764844.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"left wing labour staff in bolshevik plot to keep control of the party if jeremy corbyn suddenly steps down","story":"Emergency plans are reportedly being drawn up to severely restrict the powers of his deputy Tom Watson  he becomes “acting leader”.All decisions would therefore have to go through the hard-left National Executive Committee as part of attempts to stop moderates taking back control of the direction of Labour.There are fears that in the months-long period while a leadership contest is arranged and run, opponents of the Corbyn project will seek to roll back the changes he has made.The HuffPost said a proposed rule change drafted by senior allies of the current leader would add a brand new clause to the Labour constitution.It would effectively put the NEC in charge rather than Mr Watson, by setting out the “acting leader’s scope for action, powers, requirement for approval of actions by the NEC and any other qualications on the scope of the role”.The wording of the change, which is buried in the papers being discussed at today’s meeting of the executive and has no guarantee of being passes, has sparked anger among MPs.One told HuffPost: “This looks like they’re trying to turn the NEC into the Politburo with greater power than the acting leader.“But it also looks like someone is trying to lay the ground for the departure of Jeremy at some point over the next year.”And a senior figure added: “It’s an unenforceable act of paranoid Bolshevism.”But Mr Corbyn is currently showing no signs of wanting to step down, and a Labour source said it was “complete and utter rubbish” to suggest he was intending to resign.Mr Watson, who was elected by the member with his own mandate back in 2015, and has repeatedly found himself at odds with his boss.He was involved in the failed 2016 coup against the Labour leader, and despite being more loyal since the 2017 election he has been critical in recent weeks over Mr Corbyn’s handling of the anti-Semitism crisis.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was serving Anastasia Hitt under coercion.”Giving evidence, Miss Jenkins told the jury: “I don’t remember how many  I had. I was constantly getting booted and punched, booted and punched.“It was mainly Ian, but Michael would join in, and  he stopped, Jean would join in.”Some of the strongest evidence of the women’s ordeals was unwittingly provided by Hitt herself – because she had a phone app that recorded all conversations.In one recording, Hitt discussed Miss Jenkins being “locked in,” and complained about her speaking to a social worker through the letterbox.Describing another conversation, Mr Russell said: “They’re taking a ghoulish delight in the level of abuse their two prisoners can stand.”The victims were finally saved when police received an anonymous tip-off and they raided the two flats.Miss Jenkins had suffered extensive facial injuries, a fractured breastbone and a broken finger.Her mum had two fractures to her back, two broken ribs, and bruises all over her face.Ms Dagley told the court: “They would lock me up every night, and then let me out in the morning to help Jean in her flat, and then lock me up again at night.“It was all of them.”Prosecutors said Jean Kelly was the ringleader who directed the detention and forced labour of both victims.Mr Russell said: “She boasted cruelly in phone calls to her daughter about the injuries inflicted on both women.

I didn’t have any other way to contextualise them.The news had been a long time coming for many in the LGBT community who see Bert and Ernie as gay icons.After same-sex marriage was legalised in New York, fans of the show set up a petition asking the shows creators to have Bert and Ernie get married on screen, according to Pink News.Sesame Street then released a statement saying that the characters were best friends and were created to teach preschoolers that people can be good friends with those who are very dferent from themselves.The statement added: Even though they are identied as male characters and possess many human traits and characteristics, they remain puppets and do not have a sexual orientation.The puppet pair also found themselves at the heart of a fierce debate about discrimination and religious beliefs in 2015.A baker in Northern Ireland refused to bake a cake advocating gay marriage with their faces on it.Saltzman told Queerty that he would tell people the duo were based on him and Glassman, adding: I was Ernie.I look more Bert-ish. And Arnie as a film editor —  you thought of Bert with a job in the world, wouldn’t that be perfect? Bert with his paperclips and organisation?And I was the jokester. So, it was the Bert and Ernie relationship, and I was already with Arnie when I came to Sesame Street.So I don’t think I’d know how else to write them, but as a loving couple. I wrote sketches... Arnie’s OCD would create friction with how chaotic I was.

He also defended his plans to widen the Lib Dem membership with a new class of supporters who can join the party for free, as well as allow non-MPs to stand for the leadership.The proposals were met with a mixed reception from existing party members, while Sir Vince\u0027s call for the party to become a \"movement for moderates\" has also been criticised from within Lib Dem ranks.But, the party leader told the conference: \"If you don\u0027t call yourself a \u0027moderate\u0027, fine."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-leaders-debate-tv-election_4423034.jpg?20180916145757 ","title":"top politicians back sky news election tv debate campaign","story":"Under the Sky News proposals, in which we call for head-to-head debates between the leaders of the main political parties, a Leaders\u0027 Debate Commission  would::: Set the format and rules of the debates:: Handle moderation:: Outline the criteria for political party participation:: Ensure the objectivity of audiences:: Steer negotiations between broadcasters and parties     Following Sky News successfully lobbying for TV debates in the 2010 election campaign, three head-to-head clashes were held between Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg.But since then broadcasters and politicians have failed to agree on terms and there were no head-to-head debates between the leaders of the main parties in the 2015 or 2017 general election campaigns.Sky News editor-at-large Adam Boulton has delivered a letter outlining the proposals to Theresa May at 10 Downing Street and Conservative sources have indicated they are considering their response.

James Harding, head of BBC News until last January, has also backed the campaign, telling Sky News: \"The argument is not about who\u0027s going to win, the argument is about politics and public trust.\"It\u0027s about saying that all our politicians reach the largest number of people.\"Willie Sullivan, senior director at the Electoral Reform Society, said a leaders debate is \"essential for the health of our democracy\".\"If a politician believes they are qualied to run the country, they should be willing and able to express the reasons why to the nation,\" he added.

How to his claims stand up to scrutiny?\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s no secret that immigration - and fears about it - fuelled the vote for Brexit. But today an expert report makes extremely awkward reading for some of Leave\u0027s biggest champions, including ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage. The Migration Advisory Committee concluded there should NOT be preferential treatment for EU migrants after 2020 compared to those from the rest of the world. And it said low-skilled workers should be limited, while higher-skilled ones should be encouraged. But while this may look like a Brexiteers\u0027 boon, it\u0027s not all one sided at all. The report also picked apart a string of the most pervasive myths behind the Leave vote. We\u0027ve highlighted some of the more illuminating passages - and compared them to quotes they directly contradict by one Mr Nigel Farage. If only we had this in 2016, eh?  What Nigel Farage said: We must be completely mad, as a country, to be giving people from Eastern Europe in-work benefits... Even  I thought, which I don\u0027t, there was an economic benefit to mass immigration some things are more important than money, namely the shape of our society and giving our own youngsters a chance to work.  What today\u0027s report says: The average adult migrant from the European Economic Area  contributed approximately \u0026pound2,300 more to the UK public finances than the average adult resident in the UK. The average non-EEA migrant contributed around \u0026pound840 less than the average adult resident in the UK. Far from being a drain on resources the MAC found that European migrants - especially those from EU13 which makes up older members of the bloc - pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits and use in public services. It\u0027s only non-EU migrants, who are already subject to visa controls, who on average contribute less than native Brits.   What Nigel Farage said:  The problem we’ve got is a population crisis caused by government policy on immigration. The problem is we haven’t got enough hospitals, we haven’t got enough doctors, we haven’t got enough facilities... Right now it’s pretty much at breaking point.  What today\u0027s report says: EEA migrants contribute much more to the health service and the provision of social care in financial resources and through work than they consume in services. EEA workers are an increasing share of the health and social care workforces though these sectors employ greater numbers of non-EEA migrants. There is no evidence that migration has reduced the quality of healthcare. 3. Migrants have had little impact on jobs for British citizens...   What Nigel Farage said: I would rather we had communities that were rather more united and we had a situation where young unemployed British people had a realistic chance of getting a job.  What today\u0027s report says:  In this report we assessed the impact of migration on the labour market, including on employment and wages. Taking all the new evidence into account we found that migrants have no or little impact on the overall employment and unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce. The impact may y across dferent UK-born groups with more negative effects for the lower-skilled and more positive effects for the higher-skilled. However, our robustness checks suggest that these findings are subject to uncertainty.   What Nigel Farage said: There is no question that [immigration] has pushed wage inflation down it’s helped big companies and big corporations and big landowners to make bigger profits - no argument about that.  What today\u0027s report says: In terms of wages the existing evidence and the analysis we present in the report suggests that migration is not a major determinate of the wages of UK-born workers. We found some evidence suggesting that lower-skilled workers face a negative impact while higher-skilled workers benefit, however the magnitude of the impacts are generally small. 5.

Speaking at the climax of the four-day event in Brighton, he said Brexit would be Brexiteers\u0027 ‘erotic spasm’. At least he tried to. But when the big moment arrived he failed to deliver - and called it an exotic spresm. You might say it was an anticlimax. Or he c**ked it up. Or when it came to the big moment he couldn\u0027t perform. You get the picture. So apart from that obvious and fantastic highlight, what did the Lib Dem leader actually say? Here are the five most important things we learned from Vince Cable’s speech to Lib Dem conference 2018.  Announcing a crackdown on greedy housebuilders, tax dodgers and Amazon, it\u0027s clear who the Lib Dem leader sees as his competition. Just a year after calling for more grown-up politics, Vince Cable launched a vicious attack on Jeremy Corbyn , saying he should wave goodbye  he does not back a second referendum on Brexit . He used to be the campaigning backbencher who joined us in opposing the Iraq War and defending civil liberties, he said. In his new role he has kept his hands clean and his image polished by hiring hard left bootboys and girls to do his dirty work. They do the bullying and the intimidation of colleagues and he claims not to know. He indulges anti-Semitic bigots and pleads ignorance.  Sir Vince accused Mr Corbyn\u0027s inner circle of until recently being on the Stalinist wing of the microscopic British Communist Party with policies more relevant to the steam age than to the digital age. Quoting a Tory attack line, he declared: We do not believe in magic money trees and pots of gold at the end of the rainbow. And comparing both Labour and Tories to a cult, he added: The tectonic plates of British politics are shting beneath us. The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome. The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Atlee to Gordon Brown. They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with UKIP than their party’s one-nation traditions. People of moderate, decent, humane views are being marginalised as this new Illiberal International takes shape. 2. He declared war on Amazon  Vince Cable demanded a fresh war against “world class tax-dodgers” like Amazon, Facebook and Google in a bid to revive high streets. The Lib Dem leader vowed to spearhead “a renewed offensive” on corporate tax avoidance, which he warned was ruining traditional shops and stores. He also called for HM Revenue and Customs to publish tax reports of firms operating in Britain as a way of persuading companies to cough up. Addressing activists at Lib Dems\u0027 Brighton conference, Sir Vince said: “Every citizen and company should pay their fair share and get something for what they put in. “Nothing gets up the noses of honest taxpayers more than a government squeezing every penny it can out of small firms while rolling out the red carpet for world-class tax-dodgers like Amazon, Facebook and Google. “To that end we want a renewed offensive against inidual and corporate tax-dodging.  “In addition, we will scrap outdated business rates, which are destroying our high streets, and reform company taxation for the digital age.” Web firms have been accused of shting money around the world to minimise taxes. They insist they pay all cash due in every country. Today\u0027s speech also declared war on housebuilders. The Lib Dem leader said: Big housing developers like Barratts, Berkeley Homes, and Persimmon are mainly land speculation machines with a side line in house building. Elsewhere he repeated plans to scrap inheritance tax and replace it with a levy on large financial gts received over someone\u0027s letime. Under separate plans the Lib Dems would also tax capital gains from assets at the same rate as income from employment - up to 45% - and raise taxes overall. Lastly pension tax relief would be rebalanced away from the highest earners towards those least able to save. 3. He warned of riots after Brexit  In a move that surprises literally no one, Sir Vince is making a big push for a second referendum on Brexit. It really beggars belief that the army and the police are now being asked to prepare for riots in the chaotic aftermath of a botched Brexit, he said. And billions – billions – of taxpayers’ money spent preparing for disaster. He claimed the Lib Dems have gained 10,000 members in 10 days as the party campaigns against a costly and painful exit. In a quote that risks accusations he is insulting voters\u0027 intelligence, he said: Brexit still appeals to many hearts,  not to many minds. And he said people had suffered a move from skilled and respected jobs to crap jobs - from certainty to insecurity. 4. He revealed his family chucked him out for having a mixed-race marriage  The 75-year-old spoke movingly about his own experience of racism, during his marriage to first we, Olympia, a nurse originally from Goa. The Lib Dem leader told the hall his parents threw him out of their home over the marriage. “I embarked on a mixed marriage in this country when racism was re,” he said. He told the hall his we and three children were “being denounced as people whose very presence here would lead to rivers foaming with blood. “And I was thrown out of the parental home. “So I will never waver in my commitment to call out and stand up to racism in all its forms.” “But,” he added. “We must understand that to dismiss all Brexit voters as racists is simply wrong and utterly counterproductive.” Sir Vince also refused to accept the idea that wanting immigration to be managed “like other parts of the economy” was racist. 5.

Closing the Lib Dem\u0027 2018 conference in Brighton, the party leader piled into his Labour rival - exactly one year after calling for more grown-ups in politics. Sir Vince, who spent five years in Coalition with welfare-slashing and wage-slashing Tories, was set to claim Labour had abandoned its principles under left-winger Mr Corbyn and become a mirror image of Tories and UKIP. And he said Labour members should wave goodbye to their leader  he does not back a second referendum on Brexit . Aides said David Cameron\u0027s former Business Secretary Sir Vince was calling on Mr Corbyn to quit in such a situation. But he also invited mockery by fluffing his key line from the speech. Instead of saying Brexit was Tories\u0027 erotic spasm, Sir Vince bizarrely said it was an exotic spresm.  Sir Vince was expected to tell members: He used to be the campaigning backbencher who joined us in opposing the Iraq War and defending civil liberties. In his new role he has kept his hands clean and his image polished by hiring hard left bootboys and girls to do his dirty work. They do the bullying and the intimidation of colleagues and he claims not to know. He indulges anti-Semitic bigots and pleads ignorance. Sir Vince accused Mr Corbyn\u0027s inner circle of until recently being on the Stalinist wing of the microscopic British Communist Party with policies more relevant to the steam age than to the digital age. Quoting a Tory attack line, he declared: We do not believe in magic money trees and pots of gold at the end of the rainbow. And comparing both Labour and Tories to a cult, he added: The tectonic plates of British politics are shting beneath us. The two big parties have changed from broad churches into intolerant cults. And those who question the faith are unwelcome. The Labour leadership is dominated by people who believe in doctrines far removed from the sensible social democratic tradition which prevailed from the days of Clement Atlee to Gordon Brown.  They in turn are the mirror image of the Tory zealots who have more in common with UKIP than their party’s one-nation traditions. People of moderate, decent, humane views are being marginalised as this new Illiberal International takes shape. Sir Vince also launched an attack on Boris Johnson, who he said doesn’t just resemble Trump – large, loud and blonde – he behaves more like him by the day. He added: Their cynical disregard for the truth, their treatment of women, and their inflammatory isive language make Boris and Donald the Terrible Twins of the Rabid Right. The Lib Dem leader was meant to call for a second Brexit referendum to stop hardline Leavers who want to quit with an erotic spasm but no plan - a situation that could prompt riots. But instead, inexplicably, he used the phrase exotic spresm.

But it wasn’t an everyday family scene as  they were heading home after a late party. Heartbreakingly Clare was cradling Olivia’s leless body just hours after she died at home, weeks before her sixth birthday – nearly a year after being diagnosed with a rare, aggressive brain tumour. Each second seemed on freeze frame as they drove Olivia to a hospice to give a most precious gt – their precious daughter\u0027s brain and spine for research into the tumour that killed her – a Dfuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma .  “My heart was shattered Olivia was dead but I loved being able to cuddle her again,” said Clare Gregory from Wickford, Essex. “I hadn’t been able to do that for two months as she’d been so ill she didn\u0027t want anyone touching her. “I cradled her like a new-born baby as Tony drove with our other daughter, Eva, beside him.” At Little Havens Hospice, she gently carried Olivia into the bereavement room, with twinkling fairy lights and Disney songs softly playing in the background. “It was so peaceful and quiet,” said Clare. “We tucked Olivia up in bed and she looked like she was just asleep – our little Sleeping Beauty.” Olivia was in a special chilled bed so they were able to spend some more time with her. Then she was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital  in London for the brain donation to its INSTINCT programme, co-funded by The Brain Tumour Charity . Now Clare wants to “shatter the taboo” of talking about donating brains for research in the hope of one day saving other families their heartache. A video of her and another parent talking about their daughters’ brain donations will be shown at The Brain Tumour Charity’s Nurses and Allied Professional Conference tomorrow .  The video aims to encourage more health professionals to make patients and parents aware that brain donation is an option. The family’s nightmare started in early 2017 when Olivia became increasingly tired. “From being a normal, lively little girl all she wanted to do was lie down,” said Clare who works for an investment bank. “She’d come home from school and flake out on the settee and, at bed time, she was out like a light.” During the May half-term, the family went on holiday to Great Yarmouth. “Instead of running around, Olivia would say ‘Daddy, you’ll have to carry me’ “She’d also been waking up on and off with headaches and nausea. “And she was always falling over.” Clare took Olivia to the GP twice and was told it was a virus and adenoid problems. “But I just knew something was dreadfully wrong,” she said. On June 1 2017, Olivia woke up in the middle of the night vomiting. Clare took her to A \u0026amp E at their local hospital where she was again told Olivia had a virus and sent home with Calpol and Diorlyte. Two days later, Olivia kept losing her balance and was lethargic. Clare took her to a private GP and got an appointment with a consultant paediatrician the next day. Back at home, Clare found found The Brain Tumour Charity’s HeadSmart campaign, online, which raises awareness about children’s symptoms.  Ticking off Olivia’s symptoms one by one, Clare felt sick. “I said to my mother-in-law, ‘I think the consultant is going to say Olivia has a brain tumour.’” she recalls. “But when I told the consultant about my fears, she just said, ‘oh no, brain tumours are very rare.’ “I asked her why should Olivia be exempt? Why shouldn’t she have a brain tumour?” Two days later, Olivia was worse and the weight was dropping off her. “I told Tony I was going to take to her to A \u0026amp E in the morning and that I wouldn’t leave until they gave her a scan,” said Clare. “At hospital, a nurse said she believed me when I told her I thought Olivia had a brain tumour. “She trusted my instinct and that I knew my child.” Olivia had an MRI scan and they had to wait hours for the results. “We had the long walk to the relatives’ room where doctors told us they’d found a ‘mass’ on Olivia’s brain,” said Clare. “I just replied ‘I know’ as Tony sat in shock.” The next day, Olivia had emergency surgery to put a shunt in her brain as she had hydrocephalus – fluid on the brain.  Surgeons took a biopsy which revealed she had an inoperable DIPG, which only affects around 40 children a year with a prognosis of 9-12 months. “The strange thing was that I’d never been able to imagine Olivia growing up,” said Clare. “Whether that was mother’s instinct, a premonition or coping mechanism, I don’t know. “But I just couldn’t see her in my mind as an older child.” Clare instantly accepted Olivia was going to die. “I had no choice, but what I couldn’t bear was the thought of her suffering,” she said. But it still came as a shock when doctors said that Olivia had 9-12 months to live. “I heard this gasp and realised it was me,” said Clare. During the summer holidays, Olivia had six weeks of radiotherapy and also started The Brain Tumour Charity-funded Biomede trial , the UK’s first adaptive trial for children with high-grade  brain tumours. She had few side-effects but her steroids made her put on weight and suffer mood swings. Determined to make the most of every second, the family banked happy memories, including a trip to Lapland UK, holiday in Marrakech, a simulated Tube drive, swimming with the dolphins in Dubai and EuroDisney. “We just did our best to carry on – we had Eva to think about, too,” said Clare. “Despite everything, there was still plenty of laughter – Olivia had a wicked sense of humour and loved lip-synching to her favourite group Little Mix’s songs. “And she and Eva were so funny together.”  Four months after Olivia’s diagnosis, Clare met another mum through a Facebook DIPG support group, who told her how her adult daughter had donated her brain. “It was a light bulb moment,” said Clare. “Tony and I met up with her and her husband. There was none of that head-tilted sympathy – they got it. “I was already 99.9 per cent sure I wanted to donate Olivia’s brain but meeting them confirmed my decision. “Talking to them calmed Tony’s fears about what would happen and how she would look afterwards.” Clare saw it as a way for Olivia to “leave her footstep on the world.” “I knew Olivia would never grow up or have a job, so I decided donating her brain for research would be her job,” she said. Clare got in touch with her local brain bank. “It was straight forward – I filled in some forms and put them away,” said Clare. “You didn’t have to sign them until after your child died, so you could change your mind.” They talked about it in code at home as “the gt.” By February, Olivia was weaker down her right side and had slurred speech. “It was coming up to nine months after diagnosis - it always felt like the clock ticking,” said Clare. Olivia’s MRI scan on March 22 revealed her tumour was growing again. She was now in the final stages of her le. Over the next few months, Olivia spent more and more time sleeping. “Olivia wanted to be at home with us so we set up a hospital bed in our lounge,” said Clare. “For five weeks, she couldn’t speak or swallow. It was horric.” June 5 2018 is a date which will be etched in their hearts forever. “Olivia was on morphine and I will never forget the dreadful sound of her breathing,” said Clare.  “Tony or I were always at her side and she just wanted to hold our hands all the time.” Clare rang her palliative care doctor for advice about Olivia’s pain relief. “While I was on the phone, she was holding Tony’s hand and just turned her head towards me,” said Clare. “Suddenly the awful noise stopped – she’d stopped breathing. “I kept saying ‘oh my god, oh my god, it’s over, it’s over’ down the phone. “The relief she wasn’t suffering any more was unbelievable. “She looked so peaceful.” Before they woke Eva up, the couple had time with Olivia to say their goodbyes. “We wanted – needed - that time –a bit like that precious time alone after giving birth,” said Clare. “I told Olivia, ‘I’m so sorry Mummy couldn’t fix this and save you.’” Tony’s parents who live nearby came to see Olivia and they woke Eva to tell her Olivia had died. “We all took it in turns to kiss her and say our goodbyes,” said Clare. They drove her to hospital themselves instead of ringing an ambulance as they wanted to be alone with her and had a letter saying they were taking Olivia for brain donation. After they spent some time with Olivia at the hospice, she was taken to GOSH for the brain donation. She was then taken back to the hospice in a pink coffin her big sister had chosen until her funeral a week later. “There were no scars or signs Olivia had donated her brain, except for a small mark under her hairline,” said Clare.  “She looked perfect. “I just wanted the cancer out of her – so that she was pure for her funeral and her ashes are pure.” Now Clare is sharing her story to help The Brain Tumour Charity raise awareness about how vital brain donation is for research. “We don’t call it a donation – we call it a gt – as it’s the greatest gt a parent can give,” said Clare. “Gting Olivia’s brain is a huge comfort as she is still leaving her trace on the world. “No one once asked me or even mentioned it was a possibility and I totally understand it’s not for every family, but I hope sharing my story gives more health professionals the confidence to ask the question. “It’s too late for my daughter but donating her brain for research may help other children in the future. “It gives me a glimmer of hope.” Poignantly, one of the videos Clare treasures is from Christmas when Olivia and Eva, 11, used an angel filter. Smiling into the camera, adorned with halo and wings, Olivia says, “Look, I’m a  angel because I can fly!” “Watching it is so bitter sweet - now she really is our  angel looking over us all,” said Clare. “Not a day goes by that I don’t ache for Olivia but  we help to one day save just one family our heartache it’s worth it – and I think our little angel would be proud of us.” "},{"url":null,"title":"real lolita tragic girl 11","story":"NewsThe real Lolita: Tragic girl, 11, was kidnapped and raped for months - and inspired Nabokov\u0027s scandalous novelVladimir Nabokov\u0027s novel about a professor who becomes obsessed with his teenage step daughter was inspired by a real le case of child abuse and abduction according to crime author Sarah WeinmanShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsBySarah Weinman12:30, 18 SEP 2018NewsSally Horner was abducted by a criminal posing as a father of one of her school friends \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne March afternoon in 1948, Sally Horner walked into a five-and-dime store located on one of Camden, New Jersey\u0027s busiest downtown streets. She was there on a dare: to steal a five-cent notebook, the initiation rite for joining a girls\u0027 club at her elementary school. Sally, just a month shy of her eleventh birthday, was desperate to join that clique. She was lonely, confiding her troubles in her school teacher. Her father had committed suicide when she was six. Her mother, Ella, struggled to find and keep work as a seamstress. Her older sister, Susan, was due to give birth to her first child later that summer, which would make Sally an aunt. Then a hand tugged on her arm.  A middle-aged man, positively ancient to young Sally, announced he was an FBI agent, and that Sally was under arrest. And  she didn\u0027t do as he said, she would be packed off to reform school. Sally understood how terrible a fate this would be. The man said he would let her go this time, but he could come back and find her, without any warning. Three months later, in June 1948, that man found Sally again as she walked home from school. He threatened her again, upping the ante: Sally had to tell her mother that he was the father of school friends, promising a week\u0027s worth of vacation on the Jersey Shore. Sally went home and told her mother the concocted story. Ella believed it. On June 14, Ella took Sally to the Camden bus station, kissed her goodbye, and saw her go away on a bus, sitting next to a man she\u0027d never seen before. That man wasn\u0027t an FBI agent. Sally Horner was never under arrest. And the man, who called himself many names but was generally known as Frank La Salle, a career criminal only months removed from a prison term for the statutory rape of five girls between the ages of 12 and 14.  What was supposed to be a vacation transformed into a cross country nightmare that lasted twenty-one months. It took Sally from Camden to Atlantic City, to Baltimore, to Dallas, and then to San Jose, Calornia, where she was rescued – with the help of a concerned neighbour with secrets of her own – in March 1950. But Sally hardly had a chance to grow up, to recover fully from her rescue. Only two and a half years later, she would die in a tragic car accident at the age of 15. News of that car accident spread far and wide.  Sally\u0027s initial rescue was a national media sensation, even covered as far as Australia and New Zealand. But her death reached one vital inidual: the novelist Vladimir Nabokov. He read of it in the New York Times, copied the information down on a notecard  and, from the summer of 1952 through the end of 1953, wrote the rest of the novel that had so vexed him for the previous five years. That novel became Lolita, its account of a middle-aged man\u0027s obsessive, illicit, and illegal desire for a twelve-year-old girl still controversial more than sixty years after publication in 1955. And Sally Horner\u0027s plight, and its inspiration for Lolita, hid in plain sight, like a neon sign read to flash under the right circumstances, thanks to a parenthetical aside by the novel\u0027s unreliable narrator, Humbert Humbert, who wonders: “Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle [sic], a fty-year-old mechanic, did to eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?”  Research Several years ago, I stumbled upon what happened to Sally Horner while looking for my next crime story idea. Sally\u0027 s kidnapping, terrying odyssey, and dramatic rescue caught my attention with particular urgency. Here was a young girl, victimised over a twenty-one month odyssey from taking her from Camden, New Jersey to Atlantic City, then on to Baltimore, Dallas, and Calornia, by an opportunistic child molester named Frank La Salle. Here was a girl who figured out a way to survive away from home against her will, who acted in ways that baffled her friends and relatives at the time. Here was a girl who survived her ordeal when so many others, snatched away from their lives, do not. Then for her to die in a car accident just two and a half years after her rescue, her story then subsumed by a novel, one of the most iconic, important works of the 20th century, immortalised by that single parenthetical hardly anyone noticed. No wonder Sally Horner got under my skin in a way that few stories ever have before or since. No wonder I spent months chasing down court documents, talking to family members, visiting some of the places she had lived – and some of the places where her abductor, La Salle, took her. And even after a Canadian online magazine published my article about Sally\u0027s le and its connections to Lolita in the fall of 2014, I knew I wasn\u0027t finished with Sally. Or, more accurately, she was not finished with me. What drove me then and galls me now is that Sally’s abduction defined her entire short le. She never had a chance to grow up, pursue a career, marry, have children, grow old, be happy. She never got to build on the fierce intelligence so evident to her best friend that, nearly seven decades later, she spoke to me of Sally not as a peer, but as a mentor. After Sally died, her family rarely mentioned her or what had happened. They didn’t speak of her with awe, or pity, or scorn. She was only an absence. For decades Sally’s claim to immortality was as an incidental reference in Lolita, one of the many utterances by the predatory, middle-aged narrator, Humbert Humbert, that allows him to control the narrative, and of course, to control twelve-year-old Dolores Haze. Like Lolita, Sally Horner was no “little deadly demon among the wholesome children.” Both girls, fictional and real, were wholesome children.  Contrary to Humbert Humbert’s assertions, Sally, like Lolita, was no seductress, “unconscious herself of her fantastic power.” The fantastic power both girls possessed was the capacity to haunt. Over the four and a half years I spent working on The Real Lolita, I talked with a great many people about Lolita. For some it was their favourite novel, or one of their favourites. Others had never read the book but ventured an opinion nonetheless. Some loathed it, or the idea of it. No one was neutral. Considering the subject matter, this was not a surprise. Not a single person, when I quoted the passage about Sally Horner, remembered it. I can’t say Nabokov designed Lolita to hide Sally Horner from the reader. But given that the narrative moves so swtly, perhaps an homage to the highways Humbert and Dolores traverse over many thousands of miles in their cross-country odyssey, it’s easy to miss a lot as you go. Even casual readers of Lolita, who number in the tens of millions, plus the many more millions with some awareness of the novel, the two film versions, or its place in the culture these past six decades, should pay attention to the story of Sally Horner. Because it is the story of so many girls and women, not just in America and the UK, but everywhere.

Joana had created two home-made \u0027MDMA bombs\u0027 by splitting the \u0026pound7 powder into two cigarette wrappers. But the Sheffield Hallam University Maths student became unwell at around 3.30am and started fitting after complaining she was too hot.  She later died in hospital. Lavin, 21, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to supplying a controlled drug of class A on June 6, 2017, and possession of cannabis at a previous hearing. Computer science student Benjamin Williams, 25, today also pleaded guilty to supplying a controlled drug of class A. Both were bailed and will appear at Sheffield Crown Court on October 12 for sentencing. Addressing both defendants, Recorder of Sheffield judge Jeremy Richardson QC said: This matter is now ready for sentence.  Unfortunately, it\u0027s impossible for you to be sentenced today but you will be sentenced on the date in October. Please, read nothing into the fact that pre sentence reports are required and please read nothing into the fact you are being given bail. These are serious matters. All sentencing options remain open, that includes being sent to prison. At an inquest into the death of Joana in May, assistant coroner Abigail Combes recorded a conclusion of misadventure. Joana had attended Sheffield University\u0027s Student Union event night called Club Tuesdays on June 6, 2017. She had created two home-made \u0027MDMA bombs\u0027 by splitting the \u0026pound7 powder into two cigarette wrappers, Sheffield Coroner\u0027s Court heard. The Sheffield Hallam mathematics student was in a group of six who had all taken the same amount - knowing what to take \u0027following research on the internet\u0027. The group, which included Joana\u0027s boyfriend Lewis Birch, had been planning the night out for weeks and had all bought a \u0026pound7 bag each of MDMA - which amounted to a quarter of a gram.  The inquest hearing was told one member of the group, Lavin, had bought the \u0027brown-coloured substance\u0027 for everyone in preparation for the night out on June 6, 2017.

She is a woman not only out of her depth, has not only floundered for more than a decade, but has no idea where she\u0027s gone wrong. It\u0027s hard to see her without thinking of a fly batting itself against a window until it expires, able to see the fresh air but unable to find it. If she reads this - which she might, because she defines herself only by what others think of her - she\u0027ll assume I\u0027m a Left-wing liberal about to rail against her Right-wing freedom of speech. No, Katie. Someone who knows more than you is going to explain how the hatred has suffocated you. We both have epilepsy - mine very mild, hers very severe. The condition strikes in her sleep, led to her being expelled from Sandhurst, to break vertebrae and frequently dislocate her shoulders. She recently had brain surgery that ended the seizures but left her with a hole in her skull and needing to re-learn how to climb stairs. She blames the medication she has needed since young for the fact her oldest daughter is autistic and her youngest was born with a deformed hip that required many surgeries to correct. Those would be enough disability for most people to deal with. But Katie has an extra one - a mistaken belief that she\u0027s a journalist.  Let\u0027s not be precious about the Street of Shame. It is a trade, not a profession, and the only qualication necessary is a level of enthusiasm bordering on mental illness. But somewhere along the line most journalists get training. They get it from a practical degree, a vocational course, or at worst from paying attention to people who\u0027re doing it already. Katie became a journalist because first she became a media star, and she managed THAT with what she called being outspoken and everyone else called being a right cow. On The Apprentice in 2006 she hogged the camera by making amusingly-nasty remarks about maternity leave, fat people, and fellow contestants. She resigned at the end of the penultimate show citing childcare concerns, which others mocked because she had known what she was getting into. But it\u0027s perhaps worth noting both that her concerns were for two disabled daughters, and also that she was mocked mainly because she\u0027d been so happy to mock others.  Katie sold her story for six-figure sums, had celebrity spats, and was pictured in flagrante in a field with someone else\u0027s husband. She got a regular column in her local paper the Exeter Express \u0026amp Echo , but it ended after an online poll found 84% of the readers wanted her fired. It was a hint she did not take. She was invited onto TV as a guarantee of ratings. Three years ago Buzzfeed reported a former staffer at This Morning said she was always willing to cause controversy from the word go. Such programmes involve a chat with a producer in advance, and Katie would immediately come up with a firm line on something, and then wheeled on-air to spout it with little thought from either her or producers about where it would end. So in 2013 when she told Philip and Holly she wouldn\u0027t let her children play with someone called Tyler or Chardonnay or named after geography, it was pointed out one of her children was called India and the clip went viral.  Katie learned to make money by being rude and unapologetic, and the media learned to shore up their audience figures with a wingnut. Inevitably, she was offered a national newspaper column, a place in the Big Brother house, and more opprobrium as the hate multiplied. In 2015 she used her column to denounce migrants as cockroaches, and it quietly disappeared before she popped up at another website which racked up \u0026pound150,000 damages plus costs for her groundless claim that a pair of Muslim brothers banned from travelling to Disneyland were linked to al Qaeda. She met holocaust deniers, tweeted about being with crew of a Save the Children ship she didn\u0027t board, and had repeated applications to join UKIP rejected. She made a habit out of getting it wrong. She moved on to LBC, left after calling for a final solution to Islamic terror, was questioned but not charged over alleged hate crimes, and more recently staged a picture with children at a school without their parents\u0027 or teachers\u0027 permission, a gross breach of journalistic ethics. She has her own website and, one hopes, has invested in some defamation legal insurance. Now she\u0027s been sued over a defamatory tweet, lost her home, and had to enter an agreement with her creditors. All of it is due to the simple fact that she attempted to be a journalist without any of the necessary skills.  If Katie had experience of working in the media before she became its favourite monster, she\u0027d have known that what you don\u0027t say is just as important as what you do. By all means say you\u0027re snobby about the name Charmaine, but it might be an idea to know Shakespeare was happy to use it for one of his characters. If you make a habit of racking up legal bills for your employer, be careful with what you publish on social media. If you are caught lying, stop doing it. Steer clear of people with swastikas in their Twitter handles and  you don\u0027t know what defamation is, look it up. But more than anything else the lesson that Katie needed to learn was this: that becoming a hate figure is a viable but short media career. She chose a path that was an ever-decreasing spiral of bile, and it was only ever going to lead her into peril. I\u0027m not sure she knows how she got there. She started out as entertainment, and ended up with the twin Pyrrhic victories of being praised by Donald Trump and winning an IPSO ruling against the Daily Mirror about the fact she was not detained for taking ketamine in South Africa, but for spreading racial hatred. Now she\u0027s broke and the only people still paying attention are creditors and knicker-snfing Nazis.  Katie was not a journalist but a controversialist - built and brought down by her ignorance of how journalism works. Her name is flung at others who make a much better fist of it, along with accusations they all want to be like her. Nothing could be further from the truth - journalists, above all things, want to be right. Katie was just a story, and it\u0027s a sad indictment of the media that it relied for attention on a sick woman spouting proto-fascist lies. But the principal blame is on Katie herself. She had enough clues, from as early as her first interview after leaving The Apprentice when Nick Hewer said her new brand had made you famous, but it\u0027s made you loathed. And where\u0027s it going to take you now? She never seems to have asked where it would lead. Even with training, she would never have made much of a journo. She has a thick skin and bloody-mindedness, but seems to lack empathy, accuracy, self-doubt or persuasiveness. She is a curiosity, but doesn\u0027t have any. The first rule of journalism is \u0027never become the story\u0027. Not just because it\u0027s professionally embarrassing, but because all copy finishes the same way - with the word \u0027ends\u0027. * Fleet Street Fox\u0027s new book, A Bluffer\u0027s Guide To Journalism, is published in March.

Roy Lowe, 72, plunged the \u0026pound6 blade into body of his 38-year-old victim in broad daylight after purchasing it moments earlier from the homeware store. The video, released by police following the sentencing, shows Lowe stabbing the man in the middle of a crowded street.  Minutes before the attack, Lowe verbally abused a 24-year-old woman outside the Dog and Partridge pub in Nottingham before becoming involved in an altercation with the victim when he stuck up for her, Nottinghamshire Live reports.   A heated exchange took place between the two men, which can be seen in the video, before Lowe walked off, bought the kne, and stabbed his victim in the abdomen. The victim ran inside the pub followed by Lowe who was still brandishing the blade as customers watched on in horror - although he did not attack him again. Shortly afterwards he was tackled to the ground by two members of the public and pinned down until police arrived and arrested him. The victim was taken to hospital following the attack with non le-threatening injuries.  The OAP pleaded guilty to having an offensive weapon and intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm on the 38-year-old man in Milton Street at a court hearing earlier this year. Today, he was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court to eight years in prison. Detective Sergeant Andy Buxton, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: This was a calculated attack where Lowe has bought a kne with the sole intention of stabbing a man who he had an argument with.

A European study of 2,000 employees in the UK, France and Germany found the typical staff member spends a total of 187 hours - or the equivalent of 23 days a year - in meetings. The bad news is 56 per cent of those get-togethers are generally \u0027unproductive\u0027 - and 66 per cent of those polled even admitted they make excuses in order to avoid meetings. The research by business travel hotel brand Crowne Plaza Hotel \u0026amp Resorts also found one in 10 will pretend they got the time or date wrong, and one in 20 even admitted to calling in sick to get out of a meeting entirely. Mike Greenup, vice president brand management, said: “Meetings are essential for collaboration and reaching business goals, but ensuring catch-ups are effective isn’t always simple.  Experts also discovered most staff reckon 40 minutes is the ‘optimum’  for an effective meeting. Interestingly, the research found that German employees are the most likely to make excuses to duck out of meetings, with nearly three quarters confessing to doing so. By comparison, two-thirds of French employees and just more than half of UK professionals do the same. One reason employees excuse themselves from meetings may be due to the amount of catch-ups viewed as ineffective. More than one in three admit to switching off during meetings lasting too long, deeming more than half of get-togethers they attend as ‘unproductive’. Shockingly, nearly a quarter have witnessed someone else falling asleep, and a similar number have sent personal messages during a professional gathering . It also emerged employees are more likely to enjoy a meeting  it is held off-site and involves free food and drink. Over a third would get more enjoyment from a meeting with a relaxed atmosphere, and nearly two thirds would prefer for someone else to organise and run the meeting. Nearly two-thirds agreed mornings are generally better for meetings, with meetings between 9:30am and 11:30am revealed as the prime time for professional gatherings. The study showed that meeting pet peeves were also universal. Respondents said the most frustrating things about meetings, were people talking over each other, meeting rooms that are too hot or cold and people who arrive late.

Corinne Hutton, 48, became a quadruple amputee five years ago and was given a five per cent chance of surviving the potentially fatal infection. She also had part of her lung removed last year - making her more at risk of altitude sickness. But despite her disabilities, single mum Corrine is preparing to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania on October 1 to raise cash for the charity she founded. The ascent is expected to take five days, and she will be joined by ten other fundraisers.  Corrine said: Initially a lot of people tried to warn me against it, saying that the risks outweigh the rewards. I\u0027ve taught my son to never say \u0027I can\u0027t\u0027 so it wouldn\u0027t be fair  I said it. If it\u0027s down to determination and the ability to keep going, I\u0027ll get to the top.

Hopefully others will see my efforts and want to be the best they can be. The mother, from Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, has been building up her strength by working out with a personal trainer, doing Pilates and swimming. In 2015 she was the first female quadruple amputee to summit Ben Nevis and recently climbed to the summit of Ben Lomond. According to the NHS, early symptoms of sepsis may include:  a high temperature  or low body temperature chills and shivering a fast heartbeat fast breathing  In some cases, symptoms of more severe sepsis or septic shock  develop soon after. These can include:  feeling dizzy or faint a change in mental state – such as confusion or disorientation diarrhoea  nausea and vomiting slurred speech severe muscle pain severe breathlessness less urine production than normal – for example, not urinating for a day cold, clammy and pale or mottled skin loss of consciousness.

Amber and yellow danger to le warnings for wind have been issued for all of Northern Ireland and Scotland, and parts of northern England and Wales ahead of the first named storm of the 2018-19 season. Forecasters say heavy rain, flying debris, falling trees, power cuts, flooding and travel disruption are possible in the worst-hit areas when Ali hits on Wednesday. The major storm could batter some places for more than 16 hours. Here is the latest map and tracking details revealing when and where Ali is expected to wreak havoc.  Where will Storm Ali hit? Warnings are in place for the following areas from 6am on Wednesday: Scotland Central, Tayside and Fe: Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Falkirk, Fe, Perth and Kinross, Stirling. Grampian: Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Moray. Highlands and Eilean Siar: Na h-Eileanan Siar, Highland.

Wales Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey.  When will Storm Ali hit? Torrential rain and strong winds will hit Northern Ireland and western parts of Scotland in the early hours of Wednesday. Ali will then sweep across the west of Scotland and northern parts of England and Wales through the morning. Fierce winds and heavy rain will persist through the afternoon and, in some places, into the evening. A yellow warning for wind is due to expire at 10pm on Wednesday, while the more severe amber warning is set to end at 5pm. Ali is arriving one day after the remnants of former hurricane Helene slammed some areas with 80mph winds and heavy rain. What are the biggest threats? Ali\u0027s winds will gust to 80mph and up to 70mm of rain is possible in parts of western and central Scotland. According to the Met Office, people in the warning areas should prepare themselves for:  Flying debris is likely and could lead to injuries or danger to le. Road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected, with longer journey times and cancellations possible. Some damage to buildings is possible, such as tiles blown from roofs. Falling trees or branches. Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage. Some roads and bridges may close.   The Met Office said in its amber warning: Storm Ali will bring a spell of very strong winds to Northern Ireland from early on Wednesday morning, before these strong winds spread to far northwest England and central and southern Scotland by late morning. Strong winds will be accompanied by heavy squally showers. Some areas, especially high ground and coastal regions, including within the Central Belt, could see gusts of 80 mph at times. Winds will ease from the west through the afternoon. Ali is the first named storm of the 2018-19 season. The Met Office and Ireland\u0027s national weather service have decided to name major storms to bring greater urgency to warnings that encourage people to take precautions. Bronagh, Callum and Deirdre are among the other names to be used this season.  Why was an amber warning issued? The Met Office uses three colours to warn of dangerous storms - yellow, amber and, for the most severe, red. An amber warning is issued when severe weather could put lives in danger and disrupt travel. The Met Office said: You should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property. You may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.

The partially-assembled 747 was one of the main attractions at this year\u0027s Burning Man , an extravagant week-long party that attracts 80,000 revellers to the state\u0027s remote Black Rock desert.  Now angry officials say Burning Man volunteers are trespassing on public land after they moved the 40-foot tall aircraft to a new location without authorisation.  One of the main principles of the environmentally-conscious festival, which promotes \u0027decommodication\u0027 and self-reliance, is to \u0027leave no trace\u0027.  It was moved off the event site without authorisation. So its legal status is in trespass with unauthorised use, Rudy Evenson of US Buerau of Land Management  told the Reno Gazette Journal .  Bottom line is, we\u0027re evaluating options for getting rid of it. Big Imagination, the collective that organises Burning Man, introduced the installation in 2015 after they gutted the defunct plane and decorated it with luminous LED lights. The group has now issued an online statement to allay concerns that future editions of the festival are under threat. Volunteers have been told by BLM that they must reapply for a permit to transport the plane after it ran out earlier this month.  In a statement on their website , Big Imagination insist that they have not abandoned the jet and say they simply want to park it at a nearby storage facility.   They said: As a collective of 500+ volunteers who have been working on this since 2014 the last thing we would want to do is to leave behind an ecological disaster on the playa or in any way impact Burning Man from getting their permit,\u0027 they said. We acknowledge that our exodus plan has not gone as expected and we apologize for any undue stress this has caused to the greater burner community, for the Burning Man Org, and especially the BLM with whom we\u0027ve always sought good relations and whom we are working closely with to resolve this situation as rapidly as possible. We are working with the BLM to move the plane into its storage location in a manner that is in compliance with the requisite regulations and also in good stewardship of the land.

When Alita Brydon got home in the early hours after a brilliant night out with her match, she was lying in bed and thought he was The One. They had been exchanging personal, intimate, yet so mundane messages for a while, but living two hours apart meant it was tricky to arrange a meeting.

And then finally their diaries matched up, and they arranged to go for a drink.  Writing for MamaMia , Alita said: I saw him confidently approaching me, striding past the Asian grocer, the dingy Chinese takeout.  Without saying a word he laid his lips on me, laid his palm on my lower back and kissed me. It was happening. Everything was coming together.

According to local legend, the bizarre occurrence of twinning started on the island generations ago. Now there are 78 pairs of non-identical twins and 22 pairs of identical twins – including one pair of conjoined twins. Many of siblings continue to wear identical outfits even after they enter into adulthood, making it really impossible for outsiders to dferentiate one sibling from the other. In the Alabat island, four-month-old Gian and John are the youngest twins with the oldest twins Eudosia Meras and Antonina Meras in their 80s.  Scientists and doctors alike have been baffled as to why so many twins are born on the island. Although there is no government data on the twinning, a 2015 report conducted by the state, recorded the birth of 12 twins in the single year in the tiny island. With the rate of twins increasing, local doctors and the scientists are now busy studying the medical marvel that, they say, would prove to be beneficial for childless couples. To date, only a single village in India, are known to have the highest number of twins. The small village of Kodinhi in Kerala in southern India had reported the presence of around 300-350 twins within the boundaries of the same village. Doctors in the Philippines have ruled out the genetic reason as to why the twinning keeps happening in these pockets, they believe that the environment has more to do with it. Although some suggested that the drinking water should be studied. The 86-year-old grandmothers Eudosia and Antonina Meras are believed to be the oldest twins living in the island. Both widowed, the pair say they support one another.  Antononia who got married at an early age of 19 explains how her husband dferentiated between her and her twin sister. “In the initial days, my husband would often mistake Eudosia for myself. There have been some embarrassing incidents when my husband amorous overtures to my sister thinking that it was me. I had to then show him the mole on my nose, while my sister doesn’t have it. That solved the problem once and for all,” said Antononia. Her sister Eudosia chirpy like a teenager pitched and showed the mole on her lips: “See, I have a mole on my lower lips that why I am very talkative. ‘In our letime, we noticed that there are twins like us in the island. Most of us wear an identical pair of clothes and people have the dilemma of identying who is who, the grandmother of four added. Four of Eudosia’s grandchildren are twins.

Pyotr, a vocal critic of Russian President Vladimr Putin, fell into a coma last week following a court hearing and was rushed to hospital. The Mediazona publisher regained consciousness last week and was then transported to Germany for treatment. Pyotr temporarily lost his sight, hearing and ability to walk, but is doing better since he arrived in Germany on Saturday.  It is highly probable that he was poisoned, Kai-Uwe Eckardt, a doctor at the Charite university hospital in Berlin, told a news conference, adding that there was no other explanation so far for Verzilov\u0027s condition. He said Verzilov was suffering from anti-cholinergic syndrome, a condition in which certain neurotransmitters get blocked. The rapid onset of symptoms - including widely dilated pupils, high blood pressure and dry mucous membranes - was strongly indicative of a poison, Eckardt said. He added: “We assume he has an intoxication lasting almost a week now. The clinical findings speak for a specic drug group, but the substance is unknown”.  Karl Max Einhaeupl, chairman of the Charite hospital, said Pyotr improves day by day and he is no longer at risk. But six days after the substance is likely to have been ingested, the chances of identying it are not high, the doctor said, adding that it could be medicine, a natural substance or plant material. Although Verzilov is no longer in danger, he still needs intensive medical care.

Her new book, Full Disclosure, she describes her alleged tryst with the President of the United States and brands it as the ‘least impressive’ she’s ever had.   According to a copy seen by  , she says: He knows he has an unusual penis.  It has a huge mushroom head. Like a toadstool… “I lay there, annoyed that I was getting f***ed by a guy with Yeti pubes and a d*** like the mushroom character in Mario Kart...  The former stripper, whose real name is Stephanie Clford, goes on to claim Trump\u0027s penis is \u0027smaller than average but not freakishly small\u0027. The Mario character she appears to be referring to is called Toad, who looks like a cross between a man and a mushroom and has appeared in the popular Nintendo series since the late 1980s.

She added that she would dedicate the tell-all, which is due to hit shelves on October 2, to her young daughter. However she added that she would have to wait ‘until she is of a certain age’ before allowing her to read it. Daniels previously said on the ABC television show The View: You really didn’t think I would hold anything back?

She said: Everybody knows that a lot of the 60 minutes  was cut down for time. There are things that I said in my interview that I really wanted people to know, that were very important to me, that I didn’t get to say.  Daniels has been working on the tell-all for about ten years, which will also discuss her career in strip clubs and the porn industry.

I don’t want to criticise the referee but, according to me, it was a very soft penalty.“I asked my players  there was contact there but they didn’t think it was one which you have to give.”Of United’s display, Csaba added: “I think for 90 minutes plus added time we played one-way football.“The boys tried hard and it’s not easy when the clock is ticking down and you still can’t score.“In the first-half we had two very good chances where we should score and in the second half we were pressing Morton.“They were, more or less, 11 behind the ball playing very deep and they tried to counter attack.“Sometimes you have these games where you have to suffer but we have to be more clinical, must be more clinical.“We can talk about the many mistakes but we have to play faster, more with the ball into feet and up front but I think on Saturday everybody showed spirit.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5b9b902a01761.jpg ","title":"dundee united new boy booth says he shouldnt have tried to run off injury","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCallum Booth admits had he been a Dundee United veteran instead of a rookie, two months into the season Arabs would have seen a lot more of him than they have.The 27-year-old is ready for today’s Championship clash with Morton at Tannadice and,  he completes the 90 minutes, it will be the first time since his debut in mid-July.That’s when he damaged ankle ligaments in the Betfred Cup defeat at Ross County, an injury suffered early on in the tie.It could have forced him off immediately but the fact he played on was, he admits, a mistake on his part that was caused by him being new to the team.“Firstly, it’s been good to be back, obviously being out for five weeks was a long time,” said the former Partick Thistle defender.“It felt like ages, especially when you join a new club because you just want to make good impressions and get games under your belt right away.“It was my ankle, I did in it in the first half at Ross County and quite stupidly played on.“The physio came on, had a look and I thought I could probably run it off. I did feel it for the rest of the game but being at a new club you just want to show up well in your first game.“If I’d been here a couple of years I would have come off but, because it was my first game, I stayed on and probably made it worse – I woke up the next day and it was agony.“The result was five weeks out and that wasn’t ideal but it’s in the past now and I’m raring to go.”What he isn’t doing is expecting to walk right back into the team and he knows, in the shape of fellow left-back Jamie Robson, he’s facing strong competition for that defensive berth.“Jamie has been doing really well, he’s a good player and it’s good to have competition. There are a few boys still out and they’re coming back, so there’s going to be even more and that can only be good for the squad.“I feel that, when we have everyone fit, we have a very strong squad and it’s just going to be a case of getting everyone fit and keeping it that way. There are always injuries, though, it’s part and parcel of football.”His mission now is to help however he can as United look to keep picking up points to mount a strong promotion challenge.The aim today is to pick up three points. He knows that will not be easy against a Morton side who will be something of an unknown quantity after their recent change of manager.It saw ex-United boss Ray McKinnon quit after just three months in chare to take over at Falkirk and former Rangers star Jonatan Johansson replace him.“Any team that gets a new manager, they usually take a couple of weeks to implement what the new man is trying to do. This is Johansson’s first game in charge so we are not really too sure how they’ll set up.“One thing we know is they have good inidual players and experience in there as well in the middle of the park.“It’s going to be a tough game and they are a good side. They’ve had a good couple of seasons where they’ve always been in or close to the play-offs and done well in a few cups.”For United the aim is to build on a three-game unbeaten run that’s seen seven points taken from the last nine, though Booth believes it should have been a full house.“We are going not too bad but,  we want to be winning the league, we have to be holding on to results like the one we should have had at Alloa last time out.“We didn’t play great but 1-0 going into the last 10 minutes, we should have seen the game out.

Gary found fame with hits like Mary’s Prayer – which is expected to get an outing today.Organisers say the festival is all-standing and entry is via two gates on Thomson Avenue.Those attending aren’t allowed to take food or drink but outlets will be available.There will be a host of other activities taking place at Slessor Gardens, including a special event involving The Beano – where children can complete a comic cell in an attempt to break a world record.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/VA-Dundee-promo.jpg ","title":"va dundee huge queue as museum opens to wider public after debut weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA large queue of eager visitors has formed as people aim to get their first glimpse of the V\u0026ampA Dundee.After a weekend of celebrations and exclusive access to lucky ballot winners, the museum opened its doors to the general public.The iconic building officially opened at 10am today.\u0026mdash Mary\u0026#39sChapelProject  September 17, 2018Shortly after the opening time, a large queue had formed \u0026#8211 stretching past the RRS Discovery.The iconic £80 million museum welcomed thousands of visitors over Saturday and Sunday.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0027 historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0027 committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0027 financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0027 a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117524.jpg","title":"Black Isle riders go the distance","story":"\u0026nbspPLANS to develop top-notch all-weather sports facilities in a Black Isle village took a step forward last week when 25 riders saddled up in Avoch for a 50-mile ride around the peninsula.The Vuelta de Isla Negra \u0026mdash translated as cycle around the Black Isle \u0026mdash was inspired by a Spanish event which takes place at the same time and saw members of the business community team up to chase a \u0026pound300,000 fundraising target for the facilities in Avoch.Law firm Ledingham Chalmers, which has offices in Inverness, Aberdeen, Stirling and Edinburgh, staged the event on Friday in support of Avoch Amenities Association\u0027 bid to transform an old bowling green into tennis and all-weather multi-sports courts with changing facilities.Senior associate Roddy Cormack came up with the idea for the event last year.

Additional allowances are also paid for summer holidays, Christmas and birthdays.Foster carers do not have to own their own home and do not need to be married. They can also be single or living with someone, including in a same-sex relationship. They can be from any ethnic background.Training and support is provided.For more information on fostering, contact 01463 702743 or email fostering@highland.gov.ukTuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117425.jpg","title":"Gay parade plan for Inverness prompts petition","story":"\u0026nbspHUNDREDS of people have signed a petition opposing a planned parade in Inverness city centre to celebrate gay culture, describing it as unsavoury and deeply offensive.The organisers of Proud Ness, set to take place on October 6, have applied for permission to stage a march along High Street to Eden Court Theatre.But Donald Morrison, a home mission worker with the Free Church of Scotland , has gathered about 600 names on a petition opposing the parade on moral, religious and biblical grounds and also written a letter to Highland Council.Mr Morrison, of Old Edinburgh Road, Inverness, claimed in gay marches elsewhere members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  community flaunted their immorality in the most extravagant ways imaginable.\"This becomes evident especially in city centres when they thrust lewdness in the faces of men, women and children alike by frolicking unashamedly on rainbow-coloured floats making obscene sexual gestures,\" he said.\"If this unsavoury event is given planning permission then these desperately sad scenes are now likely to be witnessed very tragically in Inverness on October 6.\"Mr Morrison said the city streets were public places and should be kept child-friendly, family-friendly and people-friendly but maintained this was not the case when immoral behaviour and lestyles were promoted in their spaces.The petition includes signatures from across the region including Ullapool and Skye,\u0026nbsp although Mr Morrison said most were from Inverness and included Christians and non-Christians.

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116850.jpg","title":"New social enterprise cafe set for grand opening","story":"\u0026nbspA QUIRKY caf\u0026eacute that could be run by former prisoners in an attempt to reduce re-offending rates is opening in Inverness this week.The venue at 86 Church Street called Ar n-\u0026Agraveite, which translates to Our Place, will be officially opened by Inverness MP Drew Hendry at noon on Thursday.It aims to \u0026lsquorebuild\u0026rsquo people\u0027 lives after jail, giving them work and a chance to be a part of society.More than 50 volunteers are needed in the first year to run the venture and make it financially viable.Andrew Fowler, from the charity Signpost, which is spearheading the caf\u0026eacute scheme, said: \"We genuinely believe that we will be preparing people for work.

Chris, 33, of the city centre, who will finish the project this week, said: “Part of it was because of the nature of my work, it’s quite easy for me to spend an entire day without leaving the building.“It was partly because I wanted an excuse to leave the house and speak to another human being every day.“Beyond that, I didn’t really have any objectives.”Most of the people he met were in Aberdeen, and two thirds of the people who were photographed had volunteered to take part. He said: “There were a couple of times I had to chase people down the street saying ‘excuse me’.“I started off with friends and family and former colleagues, but people started coming to me.“The vast majority have been people who have approached me.“There’s no way I would have been able to do it myself just having to approach people in the street.“It ended up being a snowball effect.“The idea of doing a picture a day is not something I dreamed up, it’s something a lot of photographers do.” Working as a wedding photographer, Chris often has to work with a backdrop that is outwith his control, so the project allowed him to look at dferent technical aspects while fuelling his love for portrait photography.He said: “It ties in with my interests. I like taking pictures of people.“Taking a picture of a dferent person every day meant I couldn’t fall back on the same people every day. I’ve allowed myself a bit of flexibility as well.”Although two thirds of his portraits ended up being volunteers, it wasn’t always easy to get people to take part.Chris likened the process to the famine and the feast, and said there were times he struggled to get back to people in time and others when he had only six hours left to find someone.With the end of the project nearing, he will be relaxing for a bit, but hopes to continue on the project in the future.He added: “I definitely want to keep doing something.

A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly dferent in this edition.

I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Macmillan is there to help people with cancer live le as fully as they can.Offering a broad range of cancer information and support services \u0026#8211 including a free support line and a community of over 7,700 healthcare professionals \u0026#8211 demand for Macmillan’s services is constantly growing, but we rely on the generosity of the public to provide this support.Macmillan’s Coffee Morning takes place on Friday September 28 \u0026#8211 but people can host whenever they want. Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them. Throughout September, headline partner M\u0026ampS will be selling a selection of limited edition coffee morning products \u0026#8211 including lots of cakes, biscuits and two exclusive mugs \u0026#8211 with 10 per cent of proceeds going to Macmillan.Homes, workplaces and communities from the Shetland Islands to Land’s End will be hosting coffee mornings this year readers in Argyll and Bute can find events nearby using the interactive map on the Coffee Morning website www.macmillan.org.uk/coffee.Thank you to everyone who gets involved.Joanna Lumley, actress and Macmillan supporterSir,The SNP announced it is starting up a new \u0026#8216fact-checking\u0026#8217 service to monitor the accuracy of research and political statements.Many people in Scotland will be wondering  the SNP will be fact-checking the cost of its new independence blueprint.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September. For the year so far that’s over 200 kids\u0026#8217 days out in total with around 60 kids at the Oban festival and around 70 kids at the Campbeltown festival.With funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust and the Ventient Energy A\u0026#8217 Cruach Community Fund administered by Foundation Scotland it is hoped to increase the number of festivals kids can attend and to get more teams through to Lochgilphead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"come on scotland","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/09/18, 5:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA healthy Mid Argyll support will be at Hampden this evening  to see Scotland take on face World Cup semi-finalists Belgium at Hampden Park.A bus load of 40 youngsters from Lochgilphead Soccer Centre headed off to Glasgow on Friday afternoon to cheer on Scotland in their friendly game.The match is a warm-up before the serious business begins on Monday September 10 as Scotland begin the inaugural Nations League at home to Albania.Here we go again.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 36","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 09/09/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe photograph this week was taken by Colin Cameron of the Argyllshire Advertiser.It was captured on a Huawei P9 mobile phone, and Colin said: \u0026#8216I just spotted the bee while out on the hill walking the dogs.

Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead library is breeding bookworms","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 11:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead youngsters have been rewarded for their efforts in this summer\u0026#8217s library reading challenge.As part of the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge, the children were to visit their local library and read three books over the summer holidays.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience. We are now looking forward to the SCO American Minimalism concert in Helensburgh on Wednesday September 19.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 15/09/18, 11:10 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside 20 minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

MTV have launched a new channel - Club MTV - that films at the best clubs across the country. Now Furys has been selected as one of the elite for broadcast. MTV will provide a DJ for the night and all revellers have to do is turn up and get their groove on. Furys manager Steven Muir said: “MTV are doing a freshers’ tour for filming and they asked  we want to be part of it. “They were targeting big university cities and some towns. “They picked us as they had seen we won the nightclub award and UWS had grown in stature.” Steven said Furys is getting bigger and better and they are delighted to be selected as one of the clubs to be filmed.  He added: “MTV film the night and it will be aired later on in the spring on the Club MTV chance. “This is the people of Ayr’s chance to get on TV, so what we have done is ask that people come dressed smart and show off the town. “It will just be a normal night in Furys, and they asked to do it on one of our iconic nights. “So Skints on a Thursday was chosen, as that’s a busy night for students and has been running for about 10 years. “We sold out all the booths within a few hours of advertising, and the tickets are flying off the shelves. “I am advising everyone to get tickets soon, as this will no doubt be a full house.” The event occurs on Thursday, October 4 at Furys Nightclub on Nile Court.

Karen Wylie, 39, is hoping to raise \u0026pound80,000 to fly son Saul - who suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - to America for surgery which will allow him to stand independently and potentially walk. The Post reported earlier this year on the family’s campaign to help Saul whose condition causes muscle stfness in his legs and arms, meaning he cannot stand or walk unaided. The family, from Tarbolton, are fundraising so they can travel the 4000 miles to Missouri for a spinal operation which would dramatically reduce Saul’s spasticity. They hope to take Saul to St Louis Children’s Hospital to see Dr TS Park, a pioneer in Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy  surgery. Karen said: “Our objective is to get Saul to the best possible stage to allow us to apply to St Louis Children’s Hospital for him to be evaluated for this le-changing surgery. This will involve intense physiotherapy blocks, the purchase of specialised equipment and working closely with ious professional therapists to get him strong enough. This will take some time but no dream will ever be too big for our boy, it might just take a little longer to get there.” Saul was born with twin brother Clay 12 weeks’ premature. Clay weighed 3lbs and Saul just 1lb. Clay was treated at Crosshouse Hospital near Kilmarnock for three months to allow his lungs to develop and learn to feed and has now made a full recovery. However, Saul was kept in Yorkhill Hospital for six months and spent most of his first year in hospital as he was so fragile. At 18 months old, he was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. When Karen was pregnant with the twins, she and her husband Stuart were given the devastating news that Clay had a better chance of survival  Saul were to be terminated, something that was never option for them. Karen said: “We were told on several occasions that Saul was too tiny to survive but he continues to defy the experts and he is our little fighter.” Not a keen runner, Karen – who gave up work when the twins were born and cares for Saul on a full-time basis – is taking on the 10k with a group of 25 friends and her 66-year-old mum in order to raise the \u0026pound80,000 needed to take Saul to America. Karen said: “I am not a runner, but have been training three times a week for the event and can now manage to run 4.5 miles. My mum has never done anything like this before so is extremely nervous but very determined to complete the race for her grandson. “Our fundraising total is set at \u0026pound80,000 to cover my son’s surgery, specialised equipment, intense physio and a two- year rehabilitation programme. We have been campaigning for 18 weeks and have raised an incredible \u0026pound41,000 so far. “We have been overwhelmed by the kindness of friends and family who are willing to help raise funds for Saul’s journey, their generosity is very much appreciated and our family are exceedingly grateful to everyone who’s helped us on this journey. “We were extremely proud when Saul started school with his twin Clay and older brother Mylo, eight, this year. He attends Tarbolton Primary School and has several classroom assistants who support him depending on what activities are being done each day. “Like every parent we long for endless opportunities for our son. We are exceedingly grateful to everyone who has supported us on Saul’s journey to help make his dream come true – to walk like his brothers.” The run is on Sunday, September 30.

Jockey Oisin Murphy has made this year his own, riding the crest of the proverbial wave to land another Group 1 victory. It was always the worry that enigmatic HARRY ANGEL would lose his race in the stalls which he sadly did. It was a proper thrill to watch last years Arc winner ENABLE  to the track after a y absence with a decisive victory over CRYSTAL OCEAN. The John Gosden trained filly is now as short as 9/4 to retain her crown at Longchamp on October 7. With five Group 1 victories to her name you have to fancy her chances. For most of us the daily commute to work is no more hazardous than the annoyance of a late bus or a car that won’t start. Few will use a single engine plane or helicopter. It may look glamorous from the outside but for top trainers and jockeys who are engaged at two tracks on the same day it is an essential form of transport. The perils involved were highlighted on Saturday when trainer Richard Hannon’s plane collided with another on landing at a rain sodden Haydock. Mercully the only damage was to the clipped wings of the aircraft. Lets not always envy those who look as though they are living the high le. The climax to four days of racing at Doncaster comes this Saturday at 3:35pm in the final Classic of the season. Early in the week Aidan O’Brien’s KEW GARDENS was a rock solid favourite at 5/4 with LAH TI DAR  a remote second. The money has come for the Andrew Lloyd-Webber owned filly who is now favourite at 15/8 while KEW GARDENS can be backed at 2/1. LAH TI DAR  is three wins from three starts. The latest of which, the Sir Henry Cecil Stakes at York’s Ebor Festival, was a 10  rout.  In the St Leger fillies are in receipt of a 3lb weight allowance against the colts in this 1 mile 6 marathon. It is a race that John Gosden excels in  having won it four times previously. Connections are confident the step up in trip will suit her strong galloping style and that any ease in the ground will suit the daughter of DUBAWI. With just one race this summer she should arrive at post on Saturday fresh as a daisy. In contrast this will be KEW GARDENS\u0027 fth engagement of the campaign. One we like and who has stamina in abundance is KEW GARDENS\u0027 stablemate SOUTHERN FRANCE at 14/1. Lightly raced, this son of GALLILEO has caught the eye on more than one occasion despite running a touch green in second behind KEW GARDENS in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot. SOUTHERN FRANCE  looks the value each way bet. In a tactical race he may be up in the vanguard keeping LAH TI DAR honest, forcing a true gallop. If there is a flaw to be found in the new favourite as she steps up in trip and in to Group 1 company for the first time, SOUTHERN FRANCE will be sure to find it. It is a tactic that will suit KEW GARDENS whose best performances have come under a patient ride. Perhaps our selection will outstay them both.

last week, when retired local GP John Wilson undertook the same 87-mile cycle ride made in 1916 by the town\u0026rsquos legendary medical practitioner, Dr John Muir, at the age of 71.\nDr Muir served the medical needs of Selkirk from 1867-1928, becoming one of the local community\u0026rsquos most respected and well-loved figures.\nNot only was he a keen cyclist, he kept a meticulous record of his

\u0026amp Local History Service, and these were then transcribed by staff at Hawick\u0026rsquos Heritage Hub.\nTwo years later, at the request of Live Borders, Selkirk playwright and actor John Nichol used material from the diaries as the basis for his one-man, one-act play, Dr John Stewart Muir: The Beloved Doctor.\nTaking the title role himself, John\u0026rsquos play received a rapturous reception at its premiere in the town\u0026rsquos County Hotel in February, 2017.\nOne scene features Dr Muir recounting an ambitious cycle ride he took to Moffat in 1916, ing via Boreland,

delivering increased free childcare has come in for criticism by inspectors.\nLanglee Primary School Nursery is one of seven early learning centres across the Borders trialling an increase in funded early learning and childcare from 600 to 1140 hours.\nBy 2020 the additional hours should be available across the whole Borders.\nEducation bosses at Scottish Borders Council believe Langlee Nursery is capable of catering for up to 100 three-, four- and eligible two-year-old children.\nBut experts from the Care Inspectorate found the centre, which is part of the new \u0026pound10 million Langlee Primary School, is struggling to cope.\nInspectors weren\u0027t happy with the lay-out of the new nursery and highlighted the \u0027high number of accidents\u0027 that had happened as well as a shortage of staff.\nA spokeswoman for the Care Inspectorate said: \"Providing lunch for a large number of children provided a signicant organisational challenge and resulted in a poor experience for children.\n\"Staff tried hard to make lunch positive and did ensure children had something to eat and drink but opportunities for independence and children\u0027s choices were limited.\n\"On the day of our visit it was apparent that the space allocated to the nursery was not working well.\n\"The quality, layout and aesthetic appeal of play activities for children over three needed to be signicantly improved.\n\"There had been a high number of accidents in the nursery and we asked senior staff to audit these to see  there was a pattern to time, event or children involved.\"\nLanglee Nursery is made up of two classrooms and a central atrium area.\nAnd most children have access to an outdoor play area as well.\nParents praised staff in their responses to questionnaires sent out by the inspectors.\nBut the inspectors also found problems with the turnover of staff and the need for bank workers to fill in.\nThe spokeswoman added: \"There were acknowledged challenges in the staff team.\n\"The nursery had increased in the number of children quite signicantly in the last year and the staffing had lacked continuity.\n\"Additional staff needed to be employed to ensure the children\u0027s needs could be met and this was being addressed.\"\nWhile previous inspections of Langlee Nursery by the Care Inspectorate led to gradings of either \u0027very good\u0027 or \u0027good\u0027 the latest inspection found the quality of environment, of staffing, and of management as only \u0027adequate\u0027 with only the level of care and support still deemed \u0027good\u0027.\nA spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: \"The council has already taken signicant steps following the care inspectorate visit and has addressed a number of the matters raised, for example improving lunch routines.\n\"SBC takes very seriously any recommendations made during these inspections and regularly monitors progress.\n\"We are confident that the matters raised in the report are being addressed and additional support will be provided to ensure good progress is achieved

local organisations, the ambitious target was reached.\nThe fundraising effort has now triggered the release of a European Leader grant of \u0026pound150,000, along with a combination of other grants,

customer friendly and fit to meet increasing demand.\nIf the plans go to schedule, by the end of summer 2019 the auditorium will be developed to designs by Simpson \u0026amp Brown Architects.\nA raft of improvements will be made, including existing retractable seating replaced with new, better padded seats and increased legroom, plus aisle seats fitted with hand grabs, to help customers move up and down the steps more easily.\nThe current balcony seats that provide a restricted view of the stage will be replaced by around 24 new seats on diagonally stepped platforms.\nThey will offer a full view of the stage when two sections of solid balcony are replaced with steel rail and glass panels.\nAlso, new swivel stools, in the section of the balconies closest to the stage, will allow the theatre to offer some seats at a reduced ticket price.\nLow level safety lighting will be introduced into the new side balconies, and new heating ducts will be installed to deliver hot air at floor level.\nSir David Younger, chair of the Eastgate board of directors said: \u0026ldquoThe Board would like to thank most sincerely the Eastgate staff, the Friends of the Eastgate and all donors who rose magnicently to the challenge of raising a sizeable sum of money in a very short space of time.\n\u0026ldquoThe theatre was first developed in 2004 by the efforts of the local community and it is heartening for all of us to realise that all these years later it is still so valued.\n\u0026ldquoBy levering the European Leader grant the local fundraising has made a huge impact locally.\n\u0026ldquoThis, combined with the success of general manager Caroline Adam in attracting other signicant capital grants will help to ensure that the people of Tweeddale and much further

there was no evidence decisions on adoptions were being made \u0026ldquohastily.\nEven for children who have been in care from a very young age, where adoption is the \u0026ldquomost appropriate option, she said the procedure still took up to 36 months.\nMs Whincup led a team of academics from the universities of Stirling, York and Lancaster, who \u0026ndash in collaboration with the Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland \u0026ndash examined the cases of the 1,836 youngsters aged five and under who were taken into care in 2012-13.\nResearchers analysed data sent to the Scottish Government by all 32 local authorities across Scotland to find out what happened to the children over the next four years.\nHelen Whincup led a team of academics \nTheir findings, which will be unveiled at a conference in Stirling, showed that while it took an average of nine months for youngsters to be ed to their parents, the adoption process took an average\u0026nbsptwo to three years.\nChildren Looked After Statistics  data showed 1,355 youngsters aged for under were placed with other family members, put into foster care, or went to live with adoptive parents in 2012-12.\nA further 481 youngsters were looked after while remaining at home with their parents.\nBy 2016 almost a third  of the 1,355 children who had been removed from the family home had been reunited with their parents.\nAbout half this number  had been adopted, while 6% were \u0026ldquomoving towards adoption and 2% had been placed on a permanence order, removing parental rights from their natural parents.\nJust over one in 10  of the children were being permanently cared for by other family members, while 32% continued to be looked after outside of the family home.\nThere were 2% of children who were no longer in care, but where there was no further information on where they were living.\nMs Whincup said: \u0026ldquoWhat this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly.\n\u0026ldquoHowever, despite the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos explicit commitment to early permanence, other routes to secure a child\u0026rsquos care take much longer, even for our youngest children.\n\u0026ldquoFor those children where adoption is the most appropriate option, there is no evidence that this decision is taken hastily in Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoIn fact, the data shows rather the opposite \u0026ndash it takes approximately two to three years, even for those children who became looked after when they were very young.\nAs well as analysing CLAS data and information from the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration, the academics interviewed a range of people involved in the processes, including social workers, foster carers and children.\nMaggie Grant, from Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoSome children told us about early experiences of abuse and neglect, and were also able to tell us what helped them feel secure, including keeping important things from their past safe.\nResearchers are nowing moving into the second phase of the study, and will be tracking the children\u0026rsquos progress

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924. In 1925 a christian name is inscribed for the first time, when, Bella Strang, taking her third win, was partnered by  Mr C. MacTaggart.Mrs W. McKersie and Mr C. McTaggart won in 1926 and Miss S. Colville and Mr R. W. Greenlees in 1927.Mrs Mary MacFadyen, was the next winner to gain the christian name honour in 1928 and she did not have take three wins.The first and possibly only gentleman to see his christian name used, was the prolic 1950\u0026#8217s winner, Rev.

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland  told East Lothian Council the plans to build next to medieval Dirleton Castle, which dates back to the mid 13th century, were too \u0026ldquomodern and suburban.  The association said the new development,\u0026nbspproposed at Castlemains Farm immediately to the east of the castle, would \u0026ldquoirreparably damage the setting of Dirleton, destroying the important edges that define the village and separate it from the surrounding countryside.  And at a meeting of the local authority\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington, councillors voted by seven to four to reject the plans, which had been recommended for approval by their own officers.  Local ward councillor Jane Henderson said that the intervention from APRS had been \u0026ldquocritical as she criticised Historic Environment Scotland, which is responsible for Dirleton Castle, after it\u0026nbspfailed to formally object to the proposals.  The public agency, who were consultees on the application, told the local authority that while they acknowledged the development might have an impact on the castle, which is a scheduled monument, they considered the proposals\u0026nbspnot to have an impact of \u0026ldquonational signicance.  Councillor Henderson said: \"I am particularly disappointed in Historic Environment Scotland. How they can hold that name and come through so weakly on the setting of a castle, you have to ask questions about that.  However, the agency said it had already responded to a previous application for housing on the same site which had later been withdrawn.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe were consulted by East Lothian Council on the planning application for Castlemains Farm in January 2018, on the potential impact of this application on the setting of Dirleton Castle and Gardens which is a scheduled monument.  \u0026ldquoThis second planning application addressed the concerns that had been raised when the first planning application was submitted, primarily the impact of the development on the relationship between the castle and the land to the south and east. As a result, we did not object to the application.  \u0026ldquoWe did, however, highlight a risk of impact from landscaping and lighting, and have recommended further mitigation.  Developers Queensberry Properties told the committee they had held extensive consultations with council planners and the local community but they admitted they had come to an impasse with Dirleton Village Association and had to \u0026ldquoagree to disagree.  Their spokesman told the committee that while they wanted the new houses to face outwards on the edge of the village instead of presenting visitors with a view of \u0026ldquogarden sheds and trampolines, the village association wanted the houses to \u0026ldquoturn their back on the outside world.  Architect John Finlay, who helped produce the Dirleton Expects document outlining the village association\u0026rsquos vision for its future, said: \u0026ldquoThe design is as alien as  it had landed from outer space. It even has a suburban road, with all the clutter that entails, in the forefront of the castle.  Martin White from Gullane Area Community Council said the group was opposed to the development because \u0026ldquoyou do not hide castles.  He said: \u0026ldquoDirleton Castle is one of East Lothian\u0026rsquos top five visitor attractions. It may not be of national impact but it certainly matters in East Lothian.  The council received 71 written objections and only one representation supporting the development, which cited a need for affordable housing in the village.  Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress which dates back to the mid-13th century and has been at the centre of numerous sieges. At one point it was owned by the Ruthvens, who were involved in several plots against Mary Queen of Scots and King James VI.  Councillor Stuart Currie, planning committee member, raised concerns that the development appeared to bear little resemblance to the original development brief for the site that the local authority had consulted on with the community.  However, planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire said the fact those opposing the development did not have the support of Historic Environment Scotland and the council\u0026rsquos own heritage officer led him to back the planning officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to approve it.

The cake was 3ft4in\u0026nbspwide, and 8in\u0026nbsphigh, and is an exact replica of the building near Tranent High Street.  Using vanilla sponge sandwiched with buttercream, former architect Michelle carved the cake into shape before covering it in a sugar paste fondant.  She then printed the exterior of the shop onto edible paper, placing it onto the skeleton on the building.  For the finer details, Michelle used a sugar paste which she sculpted by hand.  The cake itself was crafted in Hayward\u0027s Heath, West Sussex, and then driven to Brighton, where Tranent-born George works.  \"He wanted to help revive the centre of town, so he\u0027s taken on a derelict building, and he\u0027s totally restoring it,\" said Sharon.

Then I realised it was actually a cake, and to see the level of detail and quality in doing something like that, it\u0027s quite fantastic.  \"I could take it home, put it in the building, and people would actually think it\u0027s an architect\u0027s model.\"  Sharon confirmed: \"George was absolutely blown away by the cake.

Each family member will don a special t-shirt as they do their bit for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and The Butterfly Trust.  Amelia\u0026rsquos mum Kathryn Tait is one of those who will be climbing the 86 steps inside the lighthouse before slowing making a 121ft descent back to solid ground on Saturday, September 22.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt was Amelia\u0026rsquos gran, Shirley Dinning, who had the idea.  \u0026ldquoShe wanted to do the abseil from the Forth Bridge but they already had their charities and so she could not do it for the cystic fibrosis charities. That is why she decided to do it at the lighthouse.  \u0026ldquoI have never done anything like this.  \u0026ldquoI would not say I am looking forward to it but I am looking forward to raising money for the charities.  \u0026ldquoAmelia is going to need help the rest of her le and it is nice to give something back.  The youngster, who turned one last month, was born three weeks early at the Birth Centre in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh .  It was three weeks later, following a routine heel prick, that it was discovered she had cystic fibrosis.  The genetic condition affects more than 10,400 people in the UK.  People with cystic fibrosis experience a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs, digestive system and other organs, causing a wide range of challenging symptoms affecting the entire body.  Kathryn said: \u0026ldquoShe had her heel prick test at five days old and then everything was fine.  \u0026ldquoThen, when she was three weeks old, we got a call from the Edinburgh Sick Kids Hospital to say we needed to go up because they had to discuss her results with us.  \u0026ldquoI phoned Amelia\u0026rsquos dad, Darren, at his work and said we needed to go there.  \u0026ldquoThey said she had cystic fibrosis and explained all about it \u0026ndash all about the genes, why she had it and that sort of stuff obviously it was a lot to take in.  Kathryn, who previously worked at Leuchie House, near North Berwick, as a care assistant, told the Courier she had heard of the condition but did not know a lot about it until speaking to the doctors.  Since the diagnosis, Amelia, who Kathryn described as \u0026ldquoalways smiling and [who] loves attention, has had regular trips to the Sick Kids to be checked over by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and dieticians.  Kathryn, 23, of Dovecot Way, Haddington, said: \u0026ldquoAmelia has twice daily physio which she does not enjoy.  \u0026ldquoLuckily her pancreas is sufficient and she does not have to take enzymes to help her digest food.  \u0026ldquoWhen she does have an infection, it is quite an intensive course of antibiotics, three or four times a day.  \u0026ldquoIt is just the little things we have to watch for, like spraying deodorant because, obviously, you do not want her breathing that in and dust and things.  Now friends and family members, including Amelia\u0026rsquos older sisters Laura and Abby, are getting ready to give back to the two charities.  The Butterfly Trust, based in Edinburgh, offers support to families and people affected by the condition, while the Cystic Fibrosis Trust is heavily involved in research.

Dr Gordon Rintoul, director of National Museums Scotland, invited members of the public to attend either of the two public consultation events.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are about to begin consultation on our plans for the next stage of development at the National Museum of Flight and warmly invite members of the public to come and hear our plans and tell us what they think.  \u0026ldquoWe are working with Hoskins Architects to design an entirely new hangar to be built on land right next to the museum\u0026rsquos home at East Fortune Airfield.  \u0026ldquoThis would provide a permanent home for the museum\u0026rsquos star attraction, Scotland\u0026rsquos Concorde, and help us protect other historically important aircraft which are currently at risk because they are displayed outdoors.  \u0026ldquoThe new building would enable us to signicantly improve the experience for visitors to the museum by creating a new entrance with better public facilities.  \u0026ldquoIt also presents us with the opportunity to rethink and enhance the presentation of the historic Second World War airfield, which is an important artefact in its own right.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.

Even for children who have been in care from a very young age, where adoption is the \u0026ldquomost appropriate option, she said the procedure still took up to 36 months.  Ms Whincup led a team of academics from the universities of Stirling, York and Lancaster, who \u0026ndash in collaboration with the Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland \u0026ndash examined the cases of the 1,836 youngsters aged five and under who were taken into care in 2012-13.  Researchers analysed data sent to the Scottish Government by all 32 local authorities across Scotland to find out what happened to the children over the next four years.  Their findings, which will be unveiled at a conference in Stirling, showed that while it took an average of nine months for youngsters to be ed to their parents, the adoption process took an average\u0026nbsptwo to three years.  Children Looked After Statistics  data showed 1,355 youngsters aged for under were placed with other family members, put into foster care, or went to live with adoptive parents in 2012-12.  A further 481 youngsters were looked after while remaining at home with their parents.  By 2016 almost a third  of the 1,355 children who had been removed from the family home had been reunited with their parents.  About half this number  had been adopted, while 6% were \u0026ldquomoving towards adoption and 2% had been placed on a permanence order, removing parental rights from their natural parents.  Just over one in 10  of the children were being permanently cared for by other family members, while 32% continued to be looked after outside of the family home.  There were 2% of children who were no longer in care, but where there was no further information on where they were living.  Ms Whincup said: \u0026ldquoWhat this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly.  \u0026ldquoHowever, despite the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos explicit commitment to early permanence, other routes to secure a child\u0026rsquos care take much longer, even for our youngest children.  \u0026ldquoFor those children where adoption is the most appropriate option, there is no evidence that this decision is taken hastily in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoIn fact, the data shows rather the opposite \u0026ndash it takes approximately two to three years, even for those children who became looked after when they were very young.  As well as analysing CLAS data and information from the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration, the academics interviewed a range of people involved in the processes, including social workers, foster carers and children.  Maggie Grant, from Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoSome children told us about early experiences of abuse and neglect, and were also able to tell us what helped them feel secure, including keeping important things from their past safe.  Researchers are nowing moving into the second phase of the study, and will be tracking the children\u0026rsquos progress towards adolescence and beyond.  A Scottish Government spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe want to provide safe, stable, nurturing homes for children in care at the earliest opportunity and last year adoptions in Scotland for looked-after children reached their highest level.  \u0026ldquoWe are supporting local authorities and partners \u0026ndash in health, children\u0026rsquos hearings, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and the courts \u0026ndash to develop projects to identy delays to securing permanence for looked-after children.  \u0026ldquoIn addition the First Minister has established an independent care review that is looking at the legislation, practice, ethos and culture of the whole system to improve care for children and young people."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8702506.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"media-minister-not-ruling-out-levy-on-tech-giants-to-fund-responsible-journalism","story":"  The secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport has said it would be \u0026ldquounwise to limit his options when considering how to raise a war chest in the battle against fake news.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7797102.jpg?type=article-full","title":"majority-of-scots-want-holyrood-to-control-immigration","story":"  A poll shows that 64% of Scots back immigration devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland giving them powers to decide how many visas are issued for people who want to work there.  A new report says just one in ten Scots think that the UK government has managed immigration competently and fairly and the authors say urgent action is need to restore public trust. Across the UK they are slightly more supportive with only 15% backing Britain\u0027s handling of immigration.  The figures come from the largest-ever public consultation on immigration, ahead of the independent Migration Advisory Committee\u0026rsquos immigration report on Tuesday expected to be pivotal to shaping Theresa May\u0026rsquos post-Brexit immigration policy.    Nicola Sturgeon has made repeated calls for a Scottish-specic immigration system in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  But the Home Office believes that applying dferent immigration rules to dferent parts of the UK would complicate the system, harming its integrity, and cause dficulties for employers who they say need the flexibility to deploy their staff to dferent parts of the UK.  It says that it will engage with and consider the views of the Scottish Government and businesses when deciding on any action over the MAC findings.  The new report from the National Conversation on Immigration, co-ordinated by think tank British Future and anti-prejudice campaigners HOPE not hate, said that even the English agreed that Scotland should take control.  Some 55% across the UK said the devolved governments should have powers over immigration. The policy is also supported by half of those who live in the Midlands  and the south east  and by Leave  and Remain  voters.    Stuart McDonald, the SNP spokesman on immigration, asylum and border control said: \u0026ldquoThe support for devolution of migration powers recorded by the National Conversation is hugely signicant and welcome. Not only in Scotland, but across the UK, people have had enough of one-size-fits-all migration rules and do not believe that the UK government will deliver competent or fair migration policies.  \u0026ldquoIt is more urgent that ever for the UK government to devolve migration powers to the Scottish Parliament, so we can build a system that is designed to meet Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and aspirations \u0026ndash for example, a post-study work visa, rules that allow families to stay together, and visas that encourage people to work, start businesses and invest here.  The First Minister has argued that Scotland needs power over immigration to attract more people north of the border where there is a rapidly ageing population.    But earlier this month, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn, one of the most influential figures in British industry said that businesses are not ready for a separate Scottish immigration system.  Earlier this month, the Home Secretary unveiled a pilot scheme that will allow fruit and vegetable growers to recruit non-EU migrants as seasonal workers - but critics say it goes \"nowhere near\" far enough to plug a recruitment crisis in Scots fruit-picking industry.  The new report calls for an annual \u0026lsquoMigration Day\u0026rsquo in Parliament, where ministers are held accountable for their performance against a three-year immigration strategy that it says should replace the annual net migration target, and would have input from the devolved administrations.    Jill Rutter, director of strategy for British Future and co-author of the report, said: \u0026ldquoThe lack of trust we found in the government to manage immigration is quite shocking. People want to have their voices heard on the choices we make, and to hold their leaders to account on their promises.  \u0026ldquoWhile people do want the UK Government to have more control over who can come to the UK, most of them are \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash they recognise the benefits of migration to Britain, both economically and culturally, but also voice concerns about pressures on public services and housing.  Rosie Carter of HOPE not hate, co-author of the report, added: \u0026ldquoImmigration is a national issue, but people see it through a local lens. Where people live, and their living conditions, makes a real dference \u0026ndash that includes the perceived impact of migration on their community, broader grievances about economic insecurity and levels of contact with migrants and ethnic minorities too.  \u0026ldquoAn official National Conversation on Immigration would give people a chance to express their concerns in a constructive debate, so anxieties are not driven underground or exploited by those seeking to stoke ision.    The research by ICM for the National Conversation, which polled 700 people in Scotland also found Scots were more positive about integration with 69% agreeing \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants commit to stay in Britain, put down roots and integrate, compared to 61% UK-wide.  And just 31% in Scotland agree that \u0026ldquoit is better when migrants come here to work for a few years without putting down roots and then  home\" against 39% UK-wide.  But the report also uncovered some dissenting voices in citizens\u0027 panels held across Scotland.  In four of the five citizens\u0026rsquo panels in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh and Paisley \u0026ndash some participants felt that international students were taking the place of Scottish students.  \"This view was more surprising, given that these four citizens\u0026rsquo panels held many positive views about other forms of migration,\" said the report.  Students who live in Scotland or are from EU countries do not have to pay tuition fees in Scottish universities.    \"This seems to have fuelled a belief that Scotland\u0026rsquos universities prioritise international students from outside the EU over Scottish students for financial reasons,\" said the report.  \"However, our nationally representative ICM survey did not indicate any statistically signicant dference in the desire to reduce the number of international students in Scotland  compared with all of the UK .\"  And some over two out of three Scots were happy for the numbers of international students to be increased or remain at the same level.  The Home Office said: \"Our immigration system is designed to work for the whole of the UK. We have no current plans to introduce a devolved immigration system.  \"Scotland, as well as other devolved governments, have dferent ways available to encourage more iniduals and families to move to their part of the UK.  National Conversation on Immigration researchers held over 130 meetings in 60 locations across every nation and region of the UK, with citizens\u0026rsquo panels, recruited to be representative of the local population, in each place alongside meetings with local government, businesses, faith and civil society groups.  In Scotland, panels were held in Aberdeen, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Lerwick and Paisley.  Nationally representative research by ICM polled 3,667 people across the UK and an open online survey was completed by nearly 10,000 people.  Other Scottish findings  \u0026bull 62% agree that migrant workers support the British economy by doing jobs British people don\u0026rsquot want to do  \u0026bull 51% agree that public services are under strain because of immigration  \u0026bull 64% agree that migrants bring valuable skills for our economy and public services like the NHS  \u0026bull 51% agree that migrants are willing to work for less money so put jobs at risk and lower wages  \u0026bull 80% think the number of high-skilled migrants from the EU should remain the same or increase while 11% say they should be reduced.  \u0026bull 47% would like the number of low-skilled workers from the EU to be reduced while 34% think they should stay the same and 9% would like more.  \u0026bull 63% agree that the public should be consulted more on important national issues, like immigration.  Analysis:\u0026nbspScottish public are balancers  by Jill Rutter, Director of Strategy for British Future and co-author of the National Conversation on Immigration final report.    Immigration was one of the biggest issues of the EU referendum, but the public have not had a chance to say what should happen next.  The National Conversation on Immigration, jointly conducted by British Future and Hope not hate, is the largest ever public consultation on immigration.  Holding sixty citizens\u0026rsquo panels across the UK, including five in Scotland and a mixed English-Scottish panel in Berwick, it was a chance to hear the public\u0026rsquos voice.  These real-world conversations were constructive and pragmatic, in sharp contrast\u0026nbspto the more polarised online debate. We heard dferent views across Scotland: in Paisley, local faith and political leadership had shaped a public discourse that was more sympathetic to refugees and migrants than in similar places south of the border.  In Aberdeen, awareness of migration\u0026rsquos contribution to the oil industry was mixed with concerns about pressures on school places and housing. The Berwick citizens\u0026rsquo panel showed that views on migration can be toughest in places of low ersity and least contact.  Scotland has a distinctly more positive national immigration discourse. The Scottish public are balancers, seeing the gains of migration for the NHS and economy and wanting practical plans to manage the pressures too.  Asked to rate the overall impact of immigration on a 1-10 scale, the most common Scottish response is six out of ten, with a modest dference between the Scottish  and UK-wide  averages.  Views about whether Scotland should have more control over immigration policy often ided along independence referendum lines. There was more support in Paisley, while citizens in the Shetlands were firmly opposed.  But the sense that Westminster is distant and unlikely to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs transcends the independence question: a pro-Union panel in Edinburgh felt the City of London would dominate in decisions about future policy.  So 64% of Scots support devolving immigration powers, according to the survey that formed part of the National Conversation.    While political, business and civic society stakeholders saw a clear demographic need for immigration in Scotland, it was striking how the public were barely aware of the debate about future population needs. Scotland\u0026rsquos immigration \u0026lsquobalancers\u0026rsquo will be ready to hear that case, but a sustained national conversation on Scotland\u0026rsquos demographics will be needed for elite debate to be converted into a public one."},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dems-urge-corbyn-and-leonard-to-follow-khan-and-back-peoples-vote","story":"  But the conversion of the London Mayor to supporting a second referendum drew criticism from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, who claimed holding such a vote would throw the whole Brexit process into \u0026ldquochaos.  Writing in the Observer, Mr Khan warned the UK faced either a bad deal or no-deal, saying: \"They are both incredibly risky and I don\u0027t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people\u0027s livelihoods.  Calling for another referendum, the London Mayor added: \"This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the Government or a vote on a no-deal Brexit  one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU.  Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem\u0026rsquos deputy leader, welcomed Mr Khan\u0026rsquos support, saying: \"It shows that momentum is building to have a People\u0027s Vote on the deal.\"  Her colleague, Willie Rennie, who leads the Scottish Lib Dems, said the London Mayor had recognised that every day the promises made by the Leave campaign looked less and less believable.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos more he\u0026rsquos speaking for the overwhelming majority of Labour members and Labour voters who don\u0026rsquot want to see Britain leave the EU, insisted the Fe MSP.  He added: \u0026ldquoRichard Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn need to recognise that the tide has turned. If they\u0026rsquore serious about protecting public services and our NHS, it\u0026rsquos time for them to speak out too.  However, Barry Gardiner, the Shadow International Trade Secretary, who has previously argued against a People\u0026rsquos Vote, warning it could lead to civil disobedience, again exposed a major ision on the issue within the party.  He expressed coolness on a People\u0026rsquos Vote, saying a fresh referendum would throw the beleaguered Theresa May a \u0026ldquoleline because then she can say: \u0027Oh,  I can\u0027t get it through Parliament, I\u0027ll go back to the people\u0027\".  The Scot said the first referendum had caused \"real isions\" in the country.  \"The challenge now is to try to heal society,\" he declared.  Mr Gardiner made clear Labour\u0026rsquos official position was not to take off the table the option of another referendum because \u0026ldquonobody knows what\u0027s going to happen over the next few weeks\".  Meanwhile, the Tories launched a double attack on the People\u0026rsquos Vote.  Mr Gove dismissed Mr Khan\u0026rsquos call for a second referendum out of hand, saying he \u0026ldquowants essentially to frustrate the vote we had two and a half years ago. People voted clearly, 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU, and Sadiq is essentially saying: \u0026lsquoStop, let\u0026rsquos delay that whole process and throw it into chaos.\u0026rsquo That would be a profound mistake.  His Tory colleague Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, said Labour needed to rule out trying to delay Brexit.  \u0026ldquoAcross the country, Labour politicians are calling for a referendum rerun that would take us all back to square one.  \u0026ldquoToday, they have gone further and admitted they want to keep the UK in the EU beyond March 2019 almost three years after the country voted to leave.

Her colleague, Willie Rennie, who leads the Scottish Lib Dems, said the London Mayor had recognised that every day the promises made by the Leave campaign looked less and less believable.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos more he\u0026rsquos speaking for the overwhelming majority of Labour members and Labour voters who don\u0026rsquot want to see Britain leave the EU, insisted the Fe MSP.

If they\u0026rsquore serious about protecting public services and our NHS, it\u0026rsquos time for them to speak out too.

To applause, he added: \u0026ldquoWe do need to think about the modalities of a referendum. It\u0026rsquos not just a question of having a vote. We will want to ensure 16 and 17-year-olds have a vote. We want to ensure ex-patriates, who were deprived of their vote last time, have one.  Writing in the Observer, Mr Khan warned the UK faced either a bad deal or no-deal, saying: \"They are both incredibly risky and I don\u0027t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people\u0027s livelihoods.  Calling for another referendum, the London Mayor added: \"This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the Government or a vote on a no-deal Brexit  one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU.  However, Barry Gardiner, the Shadow International Trade Secretary, who has previously argued against a People\u0026rsquos Vote, warning it could lead to civil disobedience, again exposed a major ision on the issue within the party, saying a second poll would offer Theresa May a \u0026ldquoleline because then she can say: \u0027Oh,  I can\u0027t get it through Parliament, I\u0027ll go back to the people\u0027\".  Meanwhile, the Tories launched a double attack on the People\u0026rsquos Vote.  Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, dismissed Mr Khan\u0026rsquos call for a second referendum out of hand, saying he \u0026ldquowants essentially to frustrate the vote we had two and a half years ago.

Most families have to think hard about how to meet immediate expenses, while weighing up the long-term consequences of paying back loans when the average Scots student finishes their degree \u0026pound12k in debt.  Thankfully, however, indeed crucially, they are spared the distress of having to factor in the \u0026pound9,000 a year fees students in England have to pay, thus landing them with an eye-watering average loan of \u0026pound32k.  The Scottish Government has always robustly resisted calls to introduce a similar scheme, despite opponents arguing the position is hypocritical, since further education places have been cut to fund the policy. Critics also say it puts Scots universities at a disadvantage in terms of funding, restricts their ability to invest and forces a cap on student numbers.  And, as front page of the Herald on Sunday highlighted yesterday, it seems a number of senior Scots academics agree with this view.  The Principal of one university, who did not wish to be named, decried \u0026ldquolow investment in higher education from the Scottish Government for a decade and called for a gradual increase in fees for Scots students. They also lamented the \u0026ldquolack of a safe space to even explore the pros and cons of such a move.  Another executive team member at a top institution anonymously described free higher education as a \u0026ldquoprop for the middle classes and called for a national debate on how we fund our universities.  Now, I don\u0026rsquot doubt that these senior figures, whoever they are, have genuine concerns about funding \u0026ndashindeed, it\u0026rsquos their job to ask governments for more money.  But their reluctance to be open about their identity suggests an acute awareness of just how unpopular any change in the status quo would be.  And little wonder since a free university education is not only a principle that many Scots hold dear, but one of last crumbs of comfort Scottish families can rely on in these grim and uncertain times.  Normally I\u0026rsquom all in favour of national conversations, especially about the things that really matter. But in this case, I find myself drawn to the opposite response: now is definitely NOT the time to be having this particular debate.  At a time when many of us are already losing sleep over the potentially horrying economic ramications of Brexit, having suffered years of pitul wage growth and the chipping away of conditions that followed the financial crash, do parents really deserve the worry of an additional \u0026pound36k in fees should their children be bright enough to be offered a place at university? Young people, too, have enough on their plates dealing with the already costly chaos passed down by their parents\u0026rsquo and grandparents\u0026rsquo generations.  And make no mistake, before long \u0026pound9k a year  would be the reality. Those in favour of fees talk of a very gradual introduction at a low level, but as English students learned so brutally, such promises are easily thrown out with the bathwater alongside the principle of free education.  The fee brigade in Scotland  often talk of the continuing and shameful lack of young people from deprived backgrounds going on to university, and how free higher education subsidises the middle classes.  But it\u0026rsquos impossible to see how introducing \u0026pound9k a year fees will help these young people, especially when you look again to the experience of English students: despite a massive hike in course fees over a short period, in 2016 maintenance grants for the poorest were replaced with, yes, you guessed it, loans. I speak from experience as the first person in my family to go to university and the recipient of a full grant . I may still have decided to study had fees been in place, but I doubt I would have felt free to chose the academic path I did, one that enabled me to enjoy education for its own sake but also led me to the career I love.  I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given what right have I to tell others they should not have the same? I don\u0026rsquot have kids, but I\u0026rsquom more than happy for my taxes to be used for other people\u0026rsquos to receive the same free education I benefitted from.  After all, free university education is not a subsidy but rather a societal choice that represents an investment in young people to be paid back over the long term in many ways, not just economically, but intellectually and socially, too. The whole of society benefits, as the likes of Germany, France and Denmark agrees, even  the rest of the UK doesn\u0026rsquot.  So, no, let\u0026rsquos not have this debate right now. Let\u0026rsquos defend and retain this important principle in our lives at a time when there is little else to celebrate."},{"url":null,"title":"my-way-or-no-way-on-brexit-deal-theresa-may-insists","story":"  The Prime Minister, speaking in a BBC Panorama special on six months to go to Britain leaving the EU, made clear  Parliament later this year did not support her Chequers Plan, then \"the alternative to that will be having no deal\".

He explained: \"It is a deep disservice to our democratic traditions to have a Prime Minister now saying: \u0027You\u0027ve got no choices left, it\u0027s my fudge or the abyss\u0027 that is not true. We always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  \"Of all the con tricks we have been subject to in this whole sorry Brexit saga - from the lies in the referendum to the so-called virtues of what is nothing more than an inelegant fudge in Chequers - the worst is now to come, declared the former Liberal Democrat leader, who will be back in the spotlight today as he addresses a fringe event at the party\u0026rsquos annual conference in Brighton.  Mr Clegg said: \"We\u0027re now going to be told: \u0027It\u0027s my way or no way\u0027 it\u0027s either the Chequers fudge or a sort of cataclysmic clf-edge.  \"The idea that the only thing this country should accept is a fudge or the abyss is not only an insult to the intelligence of British voters but it\u0027s simply not true.\"  Sir Nick insisted that his experience as an MEP taught him that Britain would be given more time by the EU to reflect on what it wanted to happen ahead of the slated withdrawal date of next March.  \u0026ldquoThe clock is ticking but the clock can definitely be changed, he declared. \u0026ldquoOne thing that is very elastic in Brussels is time.

Sir Nick was scathing about the current Brexit situation, saying: \"It\u0027s the equivalent of leaving your home, locking your front door, chucking your key away and having absolutely no idea where you are going next.\"  The former party leader, who lost his Sheffield seat at the 2017 General Election, said he had been holding talks with European leaders on the Brexit situation to ensure the UK had more choices on what to do about its relationship with the EU.  In her BBC interview broadcast tonight, Mrs May also said she gets \u0026ldquoirritated by the debate about her leadership and criticised Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos controversial \u0026ldquosuicide vest comment.  Britain is heading full throttle for a total write-off of Brexit  it continues with Theresa May\u0027s disastrous plans for the Irish border, Boris Johnson has claimed.  The former Foreign Secretary launched another broadside against the PM\u0026rsquos Chequers Plan, saying the Irish border backstop deadlock was being used to force the UK into becoming a vassal state and that the talks were on course to end in a \"spectacular political car crash\".  Mr Johnson argued that the EU\u0026rsquos fall-back position for the Irish border would mean Northern Ireland being \"annexed\" by Brussels.  Alternative plans set out by Mrs May would \"effectively\" keep Britain in the bloc, he declared.  However, the PM has said the counter-proposal to her Chequers plan is \"still a hard border\" and hers is the only way that does not \"carve up the United Kingdom\".  His comments came as reports suggested the EU was preparing to accept the use of technology to avoid the need for new border infrastructure.  Mr Johnson has backed proposals by the pro-Brexit European Research Group that physical checks can be done away from the border, without keeping the UK or Northern Ireland tied to EU customs rules.  Writing in The Daily , he said: \"If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.  \"If we are to get out of this mess and get the great British motor back on track, then we need to understand the Irish backstop and how it is being used to coerce the UK into becoming a vassal state of Brussels.  The former Cabinet minister claimed the EU\u0027s backstop would leave a border down the Irish sea while the UK\u0027s proposal left it \"volunteering\" to \"remain effectively in the customs union and large parts of the single market until Brussels says otherwise\".  Both versions of the backstop were \u0026ldquodisastrous,\" argued Mr Johnson. \"One threatens the Union the other version - and its close cousin, Chequers - keep us effectively in the EU, as humiliated rules-takers.  \"We need to challenge the assumptions of both these Irish backstops, or we are heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit.  \"We are straining at the gnat of the Irish border problem - in fact we haven\u0027t even tried to chew the gnat - and we are swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-the-tories-are-snatching-away-hope-from-the-children-who-need-it-most","story":"  In its 2016 Holyrood manesto, they welcomed \u0026ldquothe Scottish Government\u0026rsquos recent decision to reintroduce national testing in primary schools. Now Ruth Davidson makes hay attacking the policy, and tries to kill it off.  The politicisation \u0026ndash the weaponisation \u0026ndash of childhood in Scotland stinks to high heaven and it does not edy the nation. Parents are being tormented by two-faced politicians deploying scare tactics about the education of their children. This is not debate, this is double-dealing of the worst order. Sadly, it has been this way for a long time.  From the issue of a Named Person to advocate for young people who might not have the support they need, through to baby boxes, free tuition fees for university students, the smacking ban and now national testing for primary school pupils, you would be forgiven \u0026ndash  you listened to the opponents of the Scottish Government \u0026ndash for thinking that Nicola Sturgeon is the witch from Hansel and Gretel, ready to eat any child who passes her cottage at Bute House made of social democratic gingerbread.  Whether you support those policies or not \u0026ndash and I personally do support those policies as a voter and a parent \u0026ndash the portrayal of the SNP as a party pushing some Stalinist family-crushing plot is clearly bonkers, and those peddling such nonsense know it\u0026rsquos bonkers. But these days, it is often the crazy not the considerate who win the day.  I spoke to John Swinney, the Education Secretary and Deputy First Minister, last week about a growing opposition to free tuition fees by senior university executives. He made it clear that he saw everything to do with the welfare and education of children on a continuum from baby boxes to free university education.  It was all about \u0026ldquovalues, he said \u0026ndash about everyone in society chipping in with taxes to pay for education, and about the state putting out a message that every child, especially the poorest, are cared for, and matter.  Now, of course, you could dismiss Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos comments as political spin \u0026ndash but, I think, he\u0026rsquos telling the truth. Actions speak louder than words, and those policies listed above \u0026ndash the Named Person, baby boxes, the smacking ban, free tuition, national testing \u0026ndash are all saying the same thing to the electorate: we are trying to do the best by your kids. Trying does not mean succeeding, but at least they\u0026rsquore trying.  There\u0026rsquos plenty I disagree with the SNP about, but when it comes to the broad spectrum of policies intended to improve the lives of children, I believe it has the best intentions at heart. And it is trying its best because at the heart of our education system lies a very real problem that the party has to take responsibility for: the struggle to close the attainment gap between children from middle class backgrounds and those from low income homes.  Disadvantaged pupils achieve around half the qualications that the most affluent achieve \u0026ndash that is a failure, especially for a social democratic party.  The opponents of the SNP, chiefly led by the Tories, picked up the attainment problem as a cudgel, and, rightly, beat the SNP over the head with it. As a result, the SNP, rightly, tried to enact policies to close the attainment gap, including national testing \u0026hellip which the Tories supported, but now don\u0026rsquot support, because, like always, what the Tories care about is power and point-scoring not policies which help the worse off in society.  Let\u0026rsquos concentrate, however, on testing in primary schools \u0026ndash intended, obviously, to help monitor failings in attainment so they can be addressed as early as possible. We\u0026rsquore told that the tests are \u0026ldquotraumatising children \u0026ndash especially those in Primary One.  This is embarrassing nonsense. I know plenty of teachers \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquom married to one \u0026ndash and not a single teacher I\u0026rsquove spoken to thinks the tests are traumatising. In fact, they laugh when they hear that. They may not like the tests, they may think they\u0026rsquore pointless, that it adds to an already huge workload \u0026ndash but trauma? Come off it, they say.  Children don\u0026rsquot have to prepare for the tests. The tests are done on iPads so it doesn\u0026rsquot feel like some scary pen and paper assessment. The tests are also \u0026ldquoadaptive which means that  the child is having trouble answering questions then it becomes easier, and  the child is doing well the questions become harder. The tests don\u0026rsquot last long - in P1 it\u0026rsquoll take no longer that 30 minutes once a year.  Some teachers feel the \u0026ldquomumsnet brigade \u0026ndash sharp-elbowed middle-class parents who want to wrap their children in cotton wool \u0026ndash hate the tests because it means their little princes and princesses might not come out with gold stars and A-pluses. What horror \u0026ndash their child might be average.  There are also concerns that it\u0026rsquos these parents who are creating the climate of fear around the tests: tell your child something is scary and the child will find it scary allow the child to do the test without inculcating fear and they\u0026rsquoll see nothing to fear.  So it is within a climate of hypocrisy, fear and falsehood that we are now to see a debate and vote on national testing in primary one, orchestrated by the Tories, which the SNP, according to political insiders, is likely to lose. The Tories have created enough chaos  to block a policy they supported until it became political convenient not to.  We\u0026rsquore going to see a policy \u0026ndash albeit flawed in many eyes, but well-intentioned and crafted to deal with one of society\u0026rsquos biggest problems \u0026ndash sacriced on the altar of political conniving. A chance to do something meaningful in schools when it comes to the education of children will likely be snuffed out.  If there\u0026rsquos any kind of fairy tale metaphor here, it isn\u0026rsquot wicked witch Sturgeon coming to gobble up your children, it\u0026rsquos the Pinocchio-nosed Tory party snatching hope away from children who need it, and locking up opportunity in a high tower that only the wealthy have the keys to, not the poorest."},{"url":null,"title":"minister-to-be-quizzed-on-45m-loan-to-sturgeon-advisers-firm","story":"  The Scottish Tories have tabled an urgent question about the taxpayer funds - some given in secret - going to Ferguson Marine Engineering, the last commercial shipyard on the Clyde.

The Tory-dominated cross-party group said this was compared to 1.8% of GDP in a worst case Brexit that forced the UK to rely on WTO rules.  The SNP said the \u0026lsquoWin Win\u0026rsquo report on the benefits of the UK, released to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the No vote in 2014 referendum, was \u0026ldquoludicrously over the top.

Mr Kilgour said the question mark over another independence vote was deterring business investment in Scotland and hurting the economy.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur report shows that a second referendum on independence for Scotland will be eight times more damaging than a worse case Brexit scenario to the Scottish economy, and that is a reality that no-one operating in businesses across Scotland could afford to come to fruition.

Labour Jackie Baillie MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy.  \"As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.  \"That is not what the people of Scotland need or want.  \"Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs.\"  An SNP spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThese claims are so ludicrously over the top they show just how rattled the Tories are - they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no .  ?\"Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK\u0027s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland - and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.  ?\"Scotland is already one of the most productive parts of the UK outside London, with resources few countries can match, and independence would allow us to make the most of that huge potential.\""},{"url":null,"title":"cbi-joins-criticism-of-scottish-business-rates-levy","story":"  The CBI said plans to let councils levy a new charge on out-of-town stores and online retailer warehouses, such as those of Amazon, would deter investment and damage the economy.  The organisation, whose members employ 500,000 Scots, also said the levy would not work as a \u0026ldquounilateral measure in the global drive to tax the digital economy more effectively.  The out-of-town supplement, which is due to be piloted from 2020, is part of a suite of reforms to the business rates system instigated by last year\u0026rsquos Barclay Review.  The CBI welcomed a series of other measures in the Barclay Review, including more reliefs for new businesses, three-year revaluations, and greater transparency.  However it was scathing about the out-of-town levy, which the Barclay Review said should be \"modest\", set by inidual councils and used to help support struggling town centres.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has also strongly criticised the idea.  Calling for the plan to be abandoned, the CBI said the extra charge would hit a cross section of employers, such as garden centres, supermarkets and car dealerships, many of them already paying a separate supplement linked to their large size.  In a submission to the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos consultation on the out-of-town charge, the CBI said: \u0026ldquoThe issue of taxation in the new digital economy is being debated across the world\u0026rsquos developed economies with the OECD , the EU and the UK government attempting to find multilateral and unilateral solutions for how to tax global online business.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish government will not be able to unilaterally address such complex issues by giving local councils the ability to impose an additional levy.  \u0026ldquoWhat an additional levy would do is hit a range of local businesses across Scotland that are doing their best to contribute to their local economies.  It said  ministers went ahead with the plan, there should be a range of safeguards including a \u0026ldquostatutory cap, clarity on how the money would be spent, and consultation with business.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said: \u0026ldquoBusiness rates have been a bone of contention for far too long. While the Scottish Government should be applauded for taking action to remedy the situation, there\u0026rsquos still some way to go to build a regime that fits the Barclay Review\u0026rsquos goal of supporting business growth and long-term investment.  \u0026ldquoWhile we\u0026rsquore very sympathetic to the plight of high streets up and down the country, clobbering vital employers with a triple tax whammy is not the solution \u0026ndash instead we need smart, creative and sustainable proposals that revive local communities through increased economic activity. The idea for an out-of-town levy is a non-starter and the proposal should be scrapped immediately.  The Scottish Retail Consortium has called the out-of-town surcharge \u0026ldquoill-considered and poorly timed, and would add to the complexity of an already complicated system.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation said the levy should help the rates regime better reflect local priorities but was likely to be a \u0026ldquobureaucratic burden for already stretched councils.  A Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the consultation we launched in June, we are now seeking views on allowing up to three local councils to introduce pilot schemes in which businesses based predominantly online or out-of-town might be charged a modest business rates supplement.  \u0026ldquoThe proceeds from this supplement would be used to support rates relief for businesses in town centres and we are consulting on a range of appropriate safeguards, such as the need for consultation with all rate-payers who might potentially be affected.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that the consultation is as wide-ranging as possible and we would encourage all those with concerns or comments about the current business rates system to take part."},{"url":null,"title":"conference-sketch-corbyns-pants-mays-rubbish-and-the-lib-dems-wonderful","story":"  It could only be the Gospel according to St Nick.

His colleague, Sir Nick Clegg, bemoaned how the Tories had abandoned their One Nation approach and had become an English National Party, indferent to Scotland and Wales.  The former Deputy Prime Minister told a conference fringe in Brighton that  the right-wingers continued to have the whip hand in the party, then separatism, which he had always opposed, would \u0026ldquoflourish.  \u0026ldquoSo, there\u0026rsquos a real danger we don\u0026rsquot lose our place in one Union, we lose our own Union as well, he warned.  Appearing on a BBC Panorama programme last night to mark six months until Brexit Day, Mrs May expressed confidence MPs would back her Chequers Plan. On Thursday, she will discuss it with fellow EU leaders over dinner at an informal summit in Salzburg.  The PM said: \"I believe we\u0027ll get a good deal we\u0027ll bring that back from the EU negotiations, put that to Parliament. The alternative to that will be not having a deal because a I don\u0027t think the negotiations will have that deal, and b we\u0027re leaving on March 29 2019.\"  But Sir Nick accused her of presenting Britain with a \"con trick\" choice on Brexit between \u0026ldquomy fudge or the abyss. He insisted: \u0026ldquoWe always have more choices  only we are prepared to take them.  Ian Blackford, the SNP\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, was equally aghast at Mrs May\u0026rsquos ultimatum.  \u0026ldquoIt would be utterly unforgivable to impose this reckless false choice. Theresa May must ditch her hard Brexit plans and get behind the SNP\u0027s compromise proposal to stay in the single market before it is too late,\" declared the Highland MP.  His Nationalist colleague, Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary, will today warn that Mrs May is leading the UK into a \u0026ldquochaotic blind Brexit with no clarity on the country\u0026rsquos future.  \u0026ldquoIt is misleading and the height of arrogance for the Prime Minister to say the only alternative to no-deal is the Tories\u0026rsquo flawed and unworkable Chequers Plan, which even they don\u0026rsquot agree on.  \u0026ldquoThe EU has been clear that the key economic planks of the Chequers Plan are not acceptable. That means there\u0026rsquos a growing danger that we are heading for a chaotic blind Brexit in which Scotland is dragged out of the EU with key questions on trade and the future relationship undecided and in the hands of hard-line anti-Europeans, he added.  This morning, the Commons Brexit Committee issued a report urging the PM to consider alternatives to her Chequers blueprint, which kept Britain aligned to Brussels to avoid a \"chaotic and damaging\" no-deal Brexit  her plan were rejected. Three committee members \u0026ndash Tories Jacob Rees-Mogg and Andrea Jenkyns and the DUP\u0026rsquos Sammy Wilson refused to endorse it.  The report came after the International Monetary Fund said all likely Brexit scenarios would \"entail costs for the UK economy\" but that a disorderly departure could lead to \"a signicantly worse outcome\".  Chancellor Philip Hammond also warned a no-deal would jeopardise the entire economic recovery since the 2008 financial crash.  Earlier, No 10 slapped down Boris Johnson after he again used his Daily  column to attack the Chequers Plan, saying under it Britain was \"heading full throttle for the ditch with a total write-off of Brexit\".  He complained the requirement for a \"backstop\" arrangement at the Irish border would leave the UK a \"vassal state\" of the EU.  But Downing St pointed out how the former Foreign Secretary had backed the plan while in Cabinet.  \"At the time, he congratulated the Prime Minister for her determination in securing the deal. He remained in Government for a full seven months after the joint report was agreed, said Mrs May\u0026rsquos spokesman.

Part of the reason for that is that childbirth, in all its bone-wrenching, bloody glory, just is traumatic, but part is that I, as an educated 30-something, was so utterly unprepared for what would happen to me.  Sure, I\u0026rsquod seen One Born Every Minute and listened to a candid friend\u0026rsquos memory of being \u0026ldquoaxed in half in the delivery room, but ultimately I must have been influenced by the dominant narrative around childbirth that always ends with the mother, hair and make-up intact, sitting up in bed \u0026ldquodoing just fine while looking lovingly at her progeny. To say that the reality came as a shock would be the understatement of the decade.  It is obviously impossible for me to say whether being better informed pre-birth would have made the actual experience any better for me, but the aversion to telling women the truth about childbirth \u0026ndash or at least to empowering women to tell their own truths about giving birth \u0026ndash is nonetheless troubling.  That there is an aversion was highlighted last week when a speech given at the British Science Festival by a Hull University lecturer received widespread media coverage. Having been asked to investigate tocophobia \u0026ndash an unreasonable dread of childbirth \u0026ndash by her local NHS, Catriona Jones said she had found that by using websites like Mumsnet to share their experiences of how traumatic childbirth can be, women are contributing to a climate of fear that is negatively impacting on other women.  \u0026ldquoIf you go online and you go into any of the Mumsnet forums there are women telling their stories of childbirth, and it was terrible, it was a bloodbath, and that can be quite frightening for women to engage with, she was widely quoted as saying.  This was seized on by the media, which to some extent demonised Mumsnet and the women who share their experiences on it. The problem is, that while these reports accurately reflected Ms Jones\u0026rsquos words, they failed to tell the whole story, with just one newspaper \u0026ndash The  \u0026ndash noting that she had also warned that cuts to antenatal services were resulting in women being less prepared for childbirth than they used to be.  \u0026ldquoPreviously, that article paraphrased Ms Jones as saying, \u0026ldquowomen would be shown around delivery rooms in the weeks before the birth but most maternity wards are now too busy.  But  the real story is that an overstretched and underfunded health service is failing to prepare women for childbirth, and that in turn is compounding their negative experience of birth, why did the narrative around the research universally become one of women terrying other women, creating an added burden for the NHS in the process? Why are we so keen to cast women as problematic rather than acknowledging they have valid stories to tell?  The obvious answer is that a media controlled by men at best fails to recognise, and at worst seeks to distort or ignore, narratives that have women and women\u0026rsquos experiences at their core. As at least some of the reports on Ms Jones\u0026rsquos comments were written by women, though, the truth is more troubling even than that, with a deep-seated societal refusal to hear women\u0026rsquos voices likely to blame.  Indeed, as has long been highlighted by the classicist Mary Beard \u0026ndash a scholar who endures endless misogynistic abuse because she tells the stories of the women airbrushed from history \u0026ndash even in the earliest written evidence of western culture \u0026ldquowomen\u0026rsquos voices are not being heard in the public sphere.  Yet the importance of hearing those voices cannot be overstated. While the unconditional support of my partner and wider family were crucial for my post-partum recovery, there is no way I\u0026rsquod have been able to come to terms with the birth experience, or get through the waking, the feeding, the worrying \u0026ndash the endless, endless worrying \u0026ndash without the company of complete strangers who at that very moment were going through exactly the same thing as me.  It was thanks to the many, many hours spent reading Mumsnet threads on everything from induction and labour to lochia and tongue-tie that I realised that everything I had just experienced was totally normal and I wasn\u0026rsquot someone for whom things had gone badly wrong. The psychological impact of that was profound.  Far from silencing women\u0026rsquos voices and ignoring the stories that have shaped their experience for centuries, we should be doing more to ensure those stories are heard. Only then can the actual cause of problems such as tocophobia be addressed and the horric can become less horrying. Websites like Mumsnet, which give women the opportunity to finally share their experiences in a public forum, are part of that solution."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-benidorm-live-playhouse-edinburgh-four-stars","story":"  Benidorm Live  The Playhouse, Edinburgh  Neil Cooper, four stars  The sun looks like setting on the Solana Hotel at the start of Derren Litten\u0026rsquos end-of-the-pier adaptation of his phenomenally successful Brits-abroad sitcom.

The SNP said devolving migration was vital to counter the UK government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquohostile \u0026lsquoLittle Britain approach to the issue and to Brexit.  In a long-awaited report on European migration, the MAC said there should be no special preference given to EU workers coming to the UK after Brexit.  It also said there was no evidence that increased EU migration had damaged le in the UK.  It concluded that EU migrants paid more in tax than they took in benefits, contributed more to the NHS workforce than the healthcare they accessed, and had no effect on crime rates.  It called on the UK government to make it easier for high-skilled workers to migrate to the UK, and called for no limit to the number of highly-skilled workers allowed in each year.  This is currently capped at 20,700 from non-EU countries.  Despite the SNP arguing for Holyrood to control migration to offset the impact of Brexit, the MAC report said it was not necessary.  It did not opine on whether migration should be devolved or stay reserved - saying that was a political decision - but it did say there was no underlying economic need for it.  It said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government take the view that EU migration to Scotland is essential for preventing a  to population decline, to offset the ageing of the existing population and to support remote communities.  \u0026ldquoAlthough lower migration might lead to population decline, this problem is not something that starts at the Scottish border, some Northern English regions have similar prospects.  \u0026ldquoMigration is much less effective at dealing with a rising old age dependency ratio than increases in the pension age and immigration may not be an effective strategy for sustaining remote communities unless the reasons for locals leaving are addressed.  \u0026ldquoOverall, we were not of the view that Scotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said politically-driven SNP demands for devolved migration were \u0026ldquoentirely unnecessaryand potentially damaging.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe report identies that Scotland\u0026rsquos demographic needs are similar to the rest of the UK and might not be best solved by immigration alone. The fact that a separate Scottish immigration policy may also require a border at Berwick is simply another reason why the SNP must abandon their policy for a separate immigration policy.  Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoScotland faces the twin challenges of an ageing population and key worker shortages. But these problems are not unique to us.  \u0026ldquoAreas of England, Wales and Northern Ireland share our population trends and need for agricultural workers, NHS and social care staff. \"This debate needs to be fought UK wide. Cutting ourselves off and looking at this issue in isolation isn\u0026rsquot the smartest way to solve it.  Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs select committee, said the report was \u0026ldquovery puzzling, with \u0026ldquosignicant gapsin its analysis and recommendations.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe MAC admit they have ignored the crucial relationship between immigration and trade, and explicitly made no recommendation on whether immigration should be part of the [Brexit] negotiations. This report still leaves a serious gap in the evidence base.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce boss Liz Cameron said employers would welcome an end to the cap on high-skilled migrants, but would dislike the idea of more charges for them.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems counter-intuitive to create further barriers to skilled migration. Any future scheme must provide a streamlined experience for both migrants and firms, while relentlessly seeking to remove bureaucracy and red tape.  Mike Cherry of the Federation of Small Businesses also said the MAC report was a concern, as some of its plans would add to the costs and administrative burden on employers.  SNP migration minister Ben Macpherson told MSPs the report was deeply disappointing.  He said: \u0026ldquoWith all of our population increase to come from migration over the next 25 years, migration is absolutely critical to Scotland\u0026rsquos future prosperity.  \u0026ldquoHowever the MAC report does little to consider Scotland\u0026rsquos needs and instead suggests that increasing the pension age would be a preferential approach to managing demographic change \u0026ndash a completely unsustainable position and one we would reject.  \u0026ldquoThis report will also be deeply disappointing to businesses and employers across Scotland who asked for a simple, low cost approach to migration which took into account the requirements of their sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"korean-leaders-meet-in-pyongyang-for-potentially-tough-talks","story":"  Mr Kim gave the South Korean president an exceedingly warm welcome, meeting him and his we at Pyongyang\u0027s airport - itself a very unusual gesture - then riding into town with Mr Moon in an open limousine through streets lined with crowds of North Koreans, who cheered and waved the flag of their country and a blue-and-white flag that symbolises Korean unity.

Because of that, the regional political situation has been stabilised and more progress is expected,\" Mr Kim said, according to South Korean media pool reports.  Mr Moon responded by expressing his own thanks to Mr Kim for making a \"bold decision\" in a New Year\u0027s speech to open a new era of detente and send a delegation to the South Korean Winter Olympics in February.  The results of the talks were not immediately available. Seoul officials earlier said they would focus on how to achieve denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, decrease military tensions along their border and improve overall ties.  The North\u0027s media said the talks would reaffirm their commitment to Korean peace, unity and prosperity.

A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead. Back in 2009 UNESCO declared Manx extinct despite there being over 1500 speakers of Manx.\u0026ldquoUNESCO was forced to change its classication of Manx from \u0026ldquoExtinct to \u0026lsquoEndangered\u0026rsquo after a group of school children wrote to them in Manx asking what language they were writing in  Manx didn\u0026rsquot exist.\u0026ldquoThe more people I talked to the more I came to find that Norn isn\u0026rsquot dead, it has just become lost in our English.

Copies of the series have sold as far away as America and Sweden.\u0026ldquoIt was just after the publication of Norn Min buk two that I received an email from the University of Bari in Italy as their Minority Languages department was interested in Norn.\u0026ldquoThey asked  they could use the Norn Min series to create an Italian-Norn phrasebook. A week later I was contacted by the World Children\u0026rsquos Book project and they offered me a contract to translate five of their books into Norn.The World Children\u0026rsquos Book project has

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from 650 to 600.One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.\u0026ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.\u0026ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John O\u0026rsquoGroats is 103 miles. It takes two hours and 49 minutes to drive the 115 miles from Lochinver in the south-west to Wick in the north-east.\u0026ldquoMy constituency covers 3675 square miles. We could fit all 73 London constituencies in my constituency, and have room left over around the sides.\u0026ldquoThe proposed changes are simply an example of the Boundary Commission running mad and it undermines democracy.\u0026ldquoWith the best will in the world, it is very hard to cover the communities within my constituency, even when driving hither and thither.\u0026ldquoThe point is that constituencies and communities have a right of access to their elected member.\u0026ldquoDespite doing what I hope is my best,  there is a shortfall in what I can do in terms of reaching out, why would I not suggest that there is a slight democratic deficit?\u0026ldquoWhen an idea is stark raving bonkers, like this one, it just has to be said loud and clear.\u0026ldquoI will, of course, contest the seat at the next election. I may not hold the seat, as I may be voted out, but whoever represents the seat will have a very dficult time representing those good people  the constituency gets any bigger.SNP MSP Gail Ross, who holds the Holyrood seat of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross, stated that the proposed changes were unacceptable even though they could in theory help her party to win Mr Stone\u0026rsquos seat.\u0026ldquoThat will be up to the electorate but I would rather we win a seat by having a good candidate and policies that appeal to voters than because the seat has been given extra territory, she said.\u0026ldquoI share Jamie\u0026rsquos concerns as my own ward for Holyrood is a massive challenge for me to get around it.\u0026ldquoDespite all the technology in place, such as Skype and WhatsApp, you need to visit all the parts of your constituency to see what is going on and to properly speak with constituents face to face.\u0026ldquoI have colleagues who hold seats in urban areas who are shocked by the amount of travelling I have to do to meet and listen to constituents.\u0026ldquoWe need more representation and smaller wards so that the electorate can be properly served by their MP and MSP.\u0026ldquoAs for the proposed name change of the Westminster seat to \u0026lsquoHighland North\u0026rsquo, that will see Caithness taken off the political map.\u0026ldquoIt will also be name that\u0026rsquos misleading as to how big the constituency is.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to le and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that ides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because  nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117364.jpg","title":"New service gives job hunters a Fair Start","story":"\u0026nbspScottish Government ViewpointFAIR Start Scotland is the country\u0027s new devolved employment support service.It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.Launched in April, earlier this year, it is an example of one of the first uses of newly devolved powers under the 2016 Scotland Act.The service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is purely voluntary.This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose \u0026ndash choosing to participate will not affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions.The service is delivered locally, meaning that no participants are left without the support they need.Delivery is over nine geographic areas including the Highlands and reflects local area economies, meeting the needs of employers, disabled people and those at risk of long-term unemployment.Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: \"What\u0027s crucial about Fair Start Scotland is that it treats people with fairness, dignity and respect and that it is focused on the needs of the inidual.\"We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential.\"As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.\"One of the many now benefitting is Highlander Alan Cairns .He has not worked for over a year and his biggest barriers to work have been low confidence and computer skills but now he has secured 16 hours of work per week.Alan started on the Fair Start Scotland service in the middle of May and has been attending the service for the past 12 weeks.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Tuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of le make le-changing decisions that create a dference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

While this may not achieve the same speeds as some other options, it may at least offer the benefit of a solution in the nearer future.“I welcome the fact that BT has agreed to investigate the practicalities of installing radio links and hope that this can play a part in helping deliver the improved broadband services that communities across Orkney desperately need to see.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The findings from these will be fed into the on-going options investigation study, which is expected to report in the autumn of 2018 on ways to improve the junctions to help reduce the risk of accidents.\"Road safety is a priority for the Scottish Government and we understand the concerns of the community. We have undertaken to update stakeholders on progress and would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that the A9 at Tain remains a trunk road safety priority.\"In 2015 Transport Scotland\u0026rsquos operating company for the region, Bear, carried out a number of works on the A9 at the Tain north junction, including new signing, extended central hatching and high friction surfacing on the local road approach to the A9.Have you been involved in an accident or near miss in the area?

A farm trailer chassis was found at Avoch.

It has also fired up my passion to bring about a real change and a radical rebalancing of power in the Scottish economy.            That’s why I was pleased to read two eagerly awaited reports on the future of the economy just published. The Institute for Public Policy Research’s  distinguished Commission on Economic Justice provides a radical and visionary plan for delivering change in a post-Brexit economy and the David Hume Institute’s  “Scotland’s Productivity Challenge” stimulates debate around a very practical agenda for change.            They complement and reinforce each other. Both reports serve as useful reminders of the importance of clarity in debate. The DHI report begins as it means to go on, “A country’s productivity is the single most important determinant of its average living standards and wealth.” The IPPR make a similar point “poor productivity ... holds back growth and holds down wages”.And both recognise the importance of long termism. So, the IPPR’s Commission notes that “the economy needs fundamental reform”, as the “weaknesses in productivity, investment and trade go back 30 years or more. They will not be addressed by incremental change or trying to ‘muddle through’.”This is refreshing. The challenges we face are deep-seated and they demand a new radicalism and vitality.There have, after all, been far-reaching changes to our economic structure over the last three decades. We have shted from being a nation of producers to being one of consumers. We have witnessed a continued contraction of manufacturing jobs and the total collapse of entire industries like mining.We have seen the emergence of a service-led economy and a consequent impact on our balance of trade and our national accounts, but also at a human level on working lives and the sustainability of local communities too.              : Richard Leonard: Mediocre SNP too timid to stand up to Tory austerityAnd we have seen a transformational loss of economic and industrial ownership and control from Scotland which has strained and broken accountability in our economy even further.Telling in the reports is an analysis that despite a high level of skills in the workforce and favourable terms of trade – we sell exports at relatively high prices compared to the imports we buy – our labour productivity and our labour force is being let down because we have low capital stock, that is we have low levels of business investment in machinery and equipment.Intriguingly, the IPPR conclude that low capital investment is exacerbated by the growth of the low-wage, precarious employment economic model. Business owners getting caught up in a downward business spiral of low pay, low investment, and low productivity.            Productivity in simple terms is measured as GDP per hour worked. The long hours culture is one of the reasons why both productivity and the quality of le is dragged down.One suggestion to tackle this is better parental leave entitlement and more holidays. I would not argue with this. But it is also long overdue that we revisit the UK opt-out of the European Union Working Time Directive, which means in Scotland alone more than a quarter of a million workers regularly work beyond a 48-hour week. We need to break away from this long hours’ culture, not only for the sake of our productivity, but also for the sake of our health, and health and safety.The answer to the productivity challenge and many other industrial questions from the political right is iniably tax cuts. But there is a sleight of hand here.Whilst the Tories have cut corporation tax from 26 pence to 19 pence, they have put up regressive taxes like VAT from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent – hitting the poorest the hardest. So, there has been a redistribution of income and wealth, but just in the wrong direction.: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workers            Moreover, both reports eschew this tax-cutting agenda. The IPPR concludes “there is in fact little evidence that investment levels are signicantly influenced by corporation tax rates” – pointing to much higher rates in much more successful economies. The DHI’s finding is that the answer to Scotland’s productivity challenge is not to be found in tax cuts, but business research and development, investment in a stronger indigenous business base and better management.And they make clear that the Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance, including education, health, housing, planning, transport and economic development.At the start of this year, the Scottish Government published its assessment of Brexit’s effect on Scotland. Productivity was singled out as the largest factor in the reduction in our GDP, expected to contribute a 5.8 per cent drop in economic output.And there is little doubt that Brexit should inject some added urgency to tackle the long-term problem of Scotland’s productivity gap. It only serves to reinforce this need for a step change in how we do things. If we do not make this change in the context of Brexit, we will simply drt even further from the high-skill, high-wage economy Scotland needs. Increasing the level of productivity is key to achieving sustainable economic development, to raising incomes and to creating better quality jobs. Scotland is one of the better performing parts of the UK by measure of productivity, but it is still below the UK average. Much of the debate in the Scottish Parliament is regularly focused on what powers the current Government does not have rather than the ones that it does.The Scottish Parliament already possesses signicant powers to influence long-term economic performance. It is high time that at long last they were used.After all, the questions we now face are far too important to be left to economists alone to answer, and they certainly cannot be left to the present parties of government. If we are to bring about the real economic change we need, we will need to change our political priorities too.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801443.1537253498!/image/image.jpg","title":"independence eight times more damaging than brexit unionists say","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Independence would be eight times as costly to the Scottish economy as Brexit, campaigners against a second independence referendum have warned on the fourth anniversary of Scotland\u0026#8217s decision on its constitutional future.                Scottish Business UK, a cross-party campaign set up to represent pro-business Unionist voices, warned that the damage to trade with the rest of the UK would outstrip losses from exiting the European single market under the government’s Brexit plans, and said employers would struggle under the weight of added uncertainty.            In a report published today entitled ‘Win-Win: the business case for Scotland’s place in the UK’, campaigners claim that Scottish independence would be eight times as costly as the Scottish Government’s worst Brexit forecasts, because Scotland would lose the additional government spending per head under the Barnett Formula.            The report also highlights figures showing trade between Scotland the rest of the UK is worth three times as much to the Scottish economy as trade with the EU. The SNP called the warning “ludicrous”.Scottish Business UK founder Robert Kilgour, an investor and former care home operator, said: “Scottish businesses and the economy has gone through an extended period of uncertainty and that is destabilising our opportunity to grow and crucially to secure inward investment.“The negative impact of the continuing uncertainty is a message I hear regularly from investors who turn to other countries or regions in England, to give their investments a more stable base from which to grow.”Former Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson, the campaign group’s chief executive, added: “We are four years from the last referendum on independence for Scotland which was not supported, yet the spectre of a further referendum remains ever present. “We’re calling on the Scottish Government to abandon the demand for another referendum and focus more on reigniting the Scottish economy, so we once again become a credible investment opportunity, on a par with other parts of the UK.”            Scottish Labour’s Economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie MSP said: “This is yet more evidence of how damaging independence would be to our economy. As the SNP itself admitted in its cuts commission, independence would mean decades of austerity, tax rises and massive reductions in public spending.“Nicola Sturgeon needs to stop putting nationalism before the NHS, schools and jobs. She should drop her plans for an unwanted second independence referendum and instead try and start fixing the mess she has made of the economy and our schools and hospitals.”An SNP spokesperson described the claims as “ludicrously over the top”.“They show just how rattled the Tories are – they know support for independence has never been so consistently high or sustained, and that Brexit may well be the point of no ,” the spokesperson said.            “Leaving the EU and a single market eight times bigger than the UK’s alone threatens to be disastrous for Scotland – and the shambolic no-deal outcome the Tories are now preparing for would be utterly catastrophic.”Meanwhile, Scotland’s minister in charge of Brexit negotiations has warned of the growing risk the UK will be forced into a “chaotic, blind Brexit”.Constitution Secretary Mike Russell accused Theresa May of “misleading” voters on the prospects for her Chequers plan, claiming EU leaders have already dismissed the UK government’s proposals.And he claimed politicians south of the Border had failed to meet their pledge that Scotland would be an “equal partner”  it stayed in the Union.Mr Russell said the Prime Minister must use a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg this week to “rule out both a ‘blind’ and a No-deal Brexit”.            Speaking ahead of an address to business leaders and academics in Edinburgh, Mr Russell said: “Four years ago today, the people of Scotland voted on our nation’s future and were then told we were to be treated as equal partners in the UK – absolutely nothing that has happened since has lived up to that pledge, with Brexit making it clearer by the day that Westminster is incapable of working in Scotland’s national interests.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801419.1537213811!/image/image.jpg","title":"paris gourtsoyannis don t think mps won t do the unthinkable","story":"        Ten years ago this month, the collapse of Lehman Brothers transformed our world.                There was a foretaste in the UK with the run on Northern Rock, but it was the US investment giant’s fall in 2008 that heralded the start of the Great Recession.            We’re still working out the ways that moment cascaded through all our lives. The impact could be so great as to be measured demographically – studies suggest there are 4.8 million fewer children in the United States, with the economic crisis forcing young people to put off the decision to have a family - sometimes indefinitely.            In purely economic terms, too, the effects are still being felt: those aged between 30 and 39 earned on average £2,000 less per year between 2008 and 2017.And then there are the effects that are less easy to measure: a generation  that feels less secure and is less confident that the world can provide a path for them - but more determined, perhaps, to find their own way.The most interesting analyses of the ten-year milestone have been the ones that have gone back to that moment, to see how it was reported and commented on at the time.One such exercise reminded me of a detail that offers a worthwhile lesson among all the other lessons, not about our economy and society, but our politics.In September 2008, in the teeth of the crisis, when it looked as  global financial institutions would topple like dominoes, the US congress actually voted against President Bush’s initial proposal for a 700bn bailout of the nine biggest American banks.            A single vote wiped 1.2tn off the value of the world stock market, in an hour. For good and for ill, the scheme was eventually revised and passed, but for a while, at least, politicians were pushed by fear of their constituents to step off the edge into the unknown.There is an assumption that MPs would never vote down the Brexit deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels, whatever it is, because the alternative is so stark.The tenth anniversary of Lehman’s collapse is a reminder that politicians are quite capable of creating the conditions for disaster - and of doing the unthinkable in response.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4801503.1537259243!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali new storm set to blast scotland a day after helene","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"spurs lose tight highland amateur cup final ","story":"Lerwick Spurs have narrowly lost the Highland Amateur Cup final after taking the tie to extra-time with a late equaliser.\nThe isles side had gone a goal down to Pentland United \u0026#8211 the competition\u0026#8217s most successful team \u0026#8211 in the 18th minute.\nPentland looked set to secure their eight Highland Amateur Cup trophy until a stoppage time equaliser from Spurs brought the game to extra-time.\nThe Lerwick side found themselves 2-1 down in the 6th minute of extra-time and were unfortunately unable to bag an equaliser.\nSpurs won five games on their way to the final including a quarter-final success against 2017 champions Avoch.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.\nTo be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.\nFrom photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the 12th July, is a big male known as 014 or “Bigga”.  Next day, the same inidual was identied at 0800hrs heading north through Yell Sound.\nSome of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.\nCommon heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.\nChanging colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.\nFrom the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notied by letter.\nTuesday 18 Sep 2018 7:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117295.jpg","title":"Lack of 999 cover for busy Harley weekend","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nAVIEMORE was covered by only a single-manned ambulance for most of the Harley Davidson Thunder in the Glens rally, it has emerged.\nIt means that a casualty could be attended to but not taken to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness in the event of an emergency until a second ambulance crew had arrived at the scene.\nIt is understood the village only had an ambulance with single crew rather than double crew available last Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday until 5pm.\nThere were an estimated 3000 motorcyclists in the area for the UK\u0027s biggest Harley rally.\nGMB Scotland also said Kingussie only had a single manned crew in operation from just after midnight on Thursday until Sunday morning.\nThe union said the situation is simply not acceptable and poses a real danger.\nAlong with the Strathy, the GMB has been calling for the Scottish Ambulance Service to get rid of the current on-call system and to replace it with 24/7 shts to bring the Aviemore base into line with most other stations in Scotland.\nJohn Marr, GMB branch secretary, said: \"Only a first responder service would have been able to be provided by an ambulance with single crew.\n\"This would have involved looking after the casualty at the location until back up arrived.\n\"We think it is dangerous and we are stepping up our calls on the government to provide the Scottish Ambulance Service with the funds required to give Badenoch and Strathspey the service the area deserves.\n\"At the moment we are going round in circles asking why there is no 24/7 cover despite Aviemore being one of the busiest tourism spots in the whole of Scotland.\n\"We have repeatedly informed the Scottish Ambulance Service that this is a dangerous situation but nothing is happening.\"\nHighland Council convener and local councillor Bill Lobban, said: \"The current level of ambulance cover is clearly completely unacceptable.\n\"Given our population added to the huge number of visitors we see on a daily basis the Scottish Ambulance Service needs to make sure we have sufficient staff on duty to provide a safe and effective service.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

Learn to Swim Programme , learners will be provided with a more exciting learn to swim programme that is supported with a range of badges and certicates.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn.

high pupils hailed for exam successes","story":"\nPupils were hailed for their exams success at the Dromore High, Sixth Form Celebration of Achievement.\n\n                \nPrincipal Ian McConaghy hailed the students and said their achievements, particularly at A Level, were down to a team effort.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAddresssing the class of 2018, he said: “To our leavers and year 14 pupils, this recognition of achievement is our chance to put you in the spotlight and say ‘well done’,‘congratulations’ and ‘best wishes’ for the next stage of your lives, to all of you.  It is right and fitting that your families join us for this occasion since achieving success in education and particularly at A level, is indeed a team effort”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the examination results Mr McConaghy continued “The results this year are excellent 87% of all the grades achieved were A*-C and all subjects were passed with no fails at all. These results are a tremendous credit to everyone involved and reflect highly on the sixth from provision here in Dromore High.”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“There are so many success stories I could mention, but for tremendous achievements I would highlight Zara Malcolmson and Charles Wright our top two pupils with 3 A* and 3A grades between them, but in truth I could carry on down the list to include many, many more all of whom worked really hard and succeeded. As per our ethos we value the achievements of every single pupil who has done their best, worked hard and succeeded”.\n\nMr McConaghy had a special welcome for retired teacher Miss Hazel Uprichard, a member of the Senior Leadership Team and Head of Science who retired in August after 33 years of dedicated service and loyalty to Dromore High, wishing her well for her retirement.\n\nCommenting on the make up of the school’s sixth form Mr McConaghy said “a considerable number of pupils join our sixth form from other schools.These pupils are an extremely welcome addition to our sixth form transferring typically from Rathfriland High School, and other schools in the locality. These pupils settled in Dromore High extremely well and they brought some new perspectives and a fresh balance to the sixth form.  \n\n“We are delighted they chose to study here and their results are an affirmation of their choice. Two of them were chosen as Head Prefects, Deputy Head Girl Zara Malcolmson and Deputy Head Boy David Whiteside.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReviewing the leavers destinations,’ Mr McConaghy indicated that approximately 20% of them were going to the UK mainland to continue their third level studies with the majority choosing to go to local universities. He said degree courses being undertaken in Accounting, Agriculture, Archaeology, Business, Biomedical Science, Communication, Economics Education, Engineering, Geography, Human Nutrition, IT, International relations and politics, Law, Mathematics, Nursing, Pharmacy, Psychology and Sport.\n\nMr McConaghy added: “Six of our pupils have secured Higher Level Apprenticeships in Accounting, Mechanical Engineering and Luke Edgar secured an IT apprenticeship with worldwide multinational firm Google. He takes up his position in London this month”.\n\nHe paid tribute to the staff for their commitment in curricular and extra-curricular activities, mentioning in particular the very broad and beneficial Enrichment programme for sixth form pupils which helps prepare them for the next stage of their career. All of this helps us as we seek to continue to educate our students to look upon themselves as global, rather than as parochial, citizens, and be able to assess risk, analyse world affairs intelligently and adapt accordingly. \n\n“Additionally, into year 13 this year we have admitted almost 100 pupils which again is a most encouraging intake and a vote of confidence by the local community and those from further afield in our sixth form”.  \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nReflecting on the disappointing lack of political progress in Northern Ireland, Mr McConaghy nonetheless offered his thanks to several local politicians for their ongoing support for the school “away from the spotlight”, in particular Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who “continues to advocate strongly on our behalf concerning our critical need for a new school building and the lack of places for pupils in year 8”. Mr McConaghy urged a strengthening of political support for the needs of the school at this critical time. \n\n“It is said that ‘self-praise is no recommendation’ however I feel it is my duty to heap praise on my staff and all those involved in educating this group of leavers. This school and it’s staff does a magnicent job and I offer as evidence to support that claim this tremendous group of young adults who are a credit to themselves, their families and this school.\n\n“Finally I would say to our leavers group, we don’t wish this to be your last event with your school. Join our alumni group being set up this year by Mrs Mitchell and keep in touch. Even though your formal education here is now complete we can be of assistance to each other. Be proud of this school wherever you study and wherever you ultimately find yourselves. We remain here to help should you ever need help in any way. My sincerest best wishes to you all.”\n\nGuest speaker Miss Claire Beckett BSc reflected on her time in Dromore High which she had enjoyed tremendously. Claire had always faced the challenge of combining a love of study with a love of farming. \n\nVery early morning starts to complete her work on the family farm near Donaghcloney preceded her busy days in school before ing to the farm for more work. Claire had enjoyed both aspects of her le tremendously. Early in le she knew that she wanted to work with animals and identied a gap in the knowledge of effective nutrition for cattle. Her education had prepared her for this and she was now pursuing this through her career with her employer Trouw Nutrition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nClaire advised the pupils to commit to the highest levels of study now even  they did not have a final destination in mind at this stage.\n\nIt was important to balance all one’s endeavours in le and realise that sometimes some things have to be sacriced for long term benefit, even  it is dficult at the time. Her advice was to “work hard at whatever is right in front of you at the time”.\n\nClaire had been influenced by a number of people in her le to good effect including her family and her teachers and she paid tribute to them. Reiterating wise words given to her that “ you enjoy your job you never work a day in your le”. She urged the pupils to work hard and pursue their dreams that they may enjoy their careers also.\n\nDuring the celebration, two musical items provided entertainment for the audience, a vocal solo by Sophie Tate accompanied by her grandfather Mr Donald McClernan on acoustic guitar, ‘Song Bird’ and a piano solo by Erin McNally entitled ‘A Steady Hand’\n\nChairman Mrs Woods thanked Claire for her inspirational speech and for presenting the certicates, prizes and cups to the recipients. Mrs Woods concluded the celebration by reiterating her pride in the pupils and the school “wishing all the pupils well on the next stage of their journey” wherever it was leading them.\n\nSEE NEXT WEEK’S LEADER FOR A PICTORIAL ROUND UP OF THE DAY.\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8630052.1536655628!/image/image.jpg","title":"final blueprints for re drawing ni s political map revealed","story":"\nThe Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland has just published its final blueprints for how the Province\u0026#8217s political map will be redrawn.\n\n                \nOne key element is that a 2016 proposal to reduce Belfast’s current four constituencies to three has been definitively scrapped.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nFinal boundary revision proposals, published by Boundary Commission NI, 10-09-18.

It’s always good craic, but our Cadets also put in some serious work, learning something new every week and stretching themselves with training that can lead to respected accreditations.  Acquiring those new skills – whether that’s a BTEC in Public Services or how to abseil off a clf – creates a real sense of achievement.  Importantly, it also gives our Cadets something signicant to put on their Personal Statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs and everyone comes away feeling positive about themselves.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“No-one can be good at everything, but we believe that everyone can be good at something and our hugely committed Adult Instructors make sure that every one of the Cadets under their care has the encouragement and opportunity to shine.”\n\nTeens from Cadet Detachments across County Antrim are already getting behind the membership campaign, preparing to welcome newcomers. \n\nCadet Sergeant Yasmin Andrews, who currently serves as her Majesty’s Lord Lieutenant’s Cadet for the County of Antrim, says, “We all know how much you can get out of being a Cadet, but we also know that it can be awkward to walk into somewhere new, knowing no-one.  Hopefully anyone coming along to check out our Detachment will see how friendly we all are and will feel welcome. … it’s up to us to persuade them to give Cadets a try!\n\n“We get to do the sort of outdoor stuff that can cost a fortune  you try to go it alone - mountain biking, climbing, marksmanship, abseiling and kayaking, plus we can do the Duke of Edinburgh Awards, work towards BTECs and we get the chance to go on Camp every year. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDromore Cadet Daniel Hooke agrees.  He says, “There’s so much happening that there really is something for everyone.  Most people find something they really enjoy and do well at but, even  you aren’t great at a particular activity, it’s always good craic having a go!”\n\nColonel McCammond adds, “Parents naturally want to give their children as many opportunities as possible but there have to be limits to withdrawals from the Bank of Mum \u0026amp Dad!  A key benefit of the cadet movement therefore is that all our activities are affordable or, even better, totally free … even the unorms are free all kids pay for is their footwear.\n\n“Cadet membership is open to boys and girls from age 12 to 18 and, right now, local Detachments are encouraging potential new members to come along and see for themselves what the Cadet movement has to offer. The earlier you join the more time you have to fit in all the experiences, but people shouldn’t be put off by the idea that they’ve maybe left it too late.

Certainly, for most people, there will be a Detachment within easy reach, and we are hoping that we’ll see plenty of potential new members coming along to check us out, without any obligation to make a commitment. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Mums and dads are welcome to come along too, to see what the kids are getting involved with … and we’re hopeful that we may even be able to persuade some intrepid parents to consider working with us as Adult Volunteers!

welcomes speed limit at local schools","story":"\nThe Department for Infrastructure has introduced a new part-time speed limit of 20 mph outside seven rural primary schools including Bronte Primary School, Ballynaskeagh Road, Banbridge.\n\n                \nIntroduced last Tuesday, the new legislation will reduce the National Speed Limit to 20 mph for a short time at the start and end of the school day when pupils are arriving in the morning and leaving school in the afternoon. This will be for a distance of 400-500 metres along adjacent roads in the vicinity of each school and will be enforceable by the PSNI.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMotorists should be aware of, and adhere to, the new arrangements in the vicinity of these schools. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nLighting on the signs  will advise motorists when the speed limit is in effect. These signs will remain off for most of the time but will light up at the start and end of the school day.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n Installation of the required signage and lighting will be complete on or shortly after September 18.\n\nWelcoming the news, the Ulster Farmers’ Union urged motorists to ‘take these seriously’. \n\nUFU’s rural affairs chairperson, Joy Rollston said “This is an important step in helping reduce the number of collisions and causalities on our roads.  \n\n“Schools are busy places, especially when children are dropped off and collected. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Department deserves credit for listening to concerns raised by the UFU and others about the dangers on often fast rural roads. \n\n“Implementing and policing part-time speed limits will help keep children safe. We would urge all motorists to take these seriously – doing so could save a child’s le.”\n\nMrs Rollston added that the UFU would like to see this extended to all rural primary schools as quickly as possible. New signage and lighting will be erected in the vicinity of the seven schools to warn motorists when the 20mph speed limit is operational. It will be enforced by the PSNI.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"celebrating irish language","story":"\n\nNOMINATIONS\n are still open for The Outstanding Contribution to the Irish Language Award in this year’s Aisling Awards.\n\nThis award celebrates the vibrancy and uniqueness which the Irish language brings to the city of Belfast, the award will honour an organisation or person who works tirelessly to pioneer the language.

It is not some form of charity or a handout, it is a right for all those who need it.”\n\nJohn says he is aware that his friend’s predicament is not an isolated case and so he feels it is time that some form of independent review was instigated to ascertain just how many people who were in receipt of DLA have been refused PIP, and also  awarded PIP, how many were given a lower rate of benefit than before.  \n\nHe said: “My friend only discovered that the medical professional approved an award of PIP for her only for another unknown inidual to intervene and essentially overrule the medical professional’s decision by submitting a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for copies of all papers associated with claim for PIP.  \n\n“Had she not done this then, presumably like many others, she may have just let it go as an appeal is not only time consuming, but also extremely stressful.”\n\nPeople Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said: “Once again we have another person applying for PIP who has been failed by the system. \n\nThe criteria for PIP is already strict and made extremely dficult for people to obtain. However the fact that this applicant initially met the criteria which was then overturned is very worrying. How many other people have been placed in this situation?\n\n“This latest case is a further example of how medical evidence is not prioritised when assessing people\u0026#8217s disability. We have heard time and again how medical evidence was not asked for in PIP cases. \n\nThis latest case once again proves how the system is not fit for purpose. It needs a complete overhaul and we need a welfare system that doesn’t punish those who are entitled to benefits.” \n\nA Department for Communities spokesperson said: “All PIP assessment reports go through a quality checking regime designed to ensure that decisions on entitlement, taken by the Department are correct. At times this may lead to an initial report being amended with the points increased or decreased. The checking process provides assurance that any approach to assessment is consistent so that customers with conditions that have the same al effect will ultimately receive the same benefit outcome. \n\n“Anyone who doesn’t agree with Department’s decision, can ask for it to be reviewed and provide any additional information. \n\n“There is then also the opportunity to appeal to an Independent Tribunal.

It’s here that Terri meets his we Ruth, played by West End star Niamh Perry, and the two try to build their le together, as Terri becomes distracted – all too easily – by trying to passionately promote the latest band to come on the punk scene as he turns promoter for Rudi and The Outcasts.\nIf anyone during Sunday’s afternoon matinee was expecting a leisurely retrospective they were in for a rude awakening as this is a gloriously full-on production of music and song with all-star cast in full, fine voice, all playing instruments and giving it the heap.\nEvery audience member is with our protagonist as he goes across the water, copious copies of seven-inch vinyl under his arm as he tries, most of the time in vain, to try and get snooty English music executives to listen to a band from Derry called The Undertones and their debut song Teenage Kicks – a song so iconic that John Peel did the unthinkable and played it twice on Radio One.\nWith every high comes the inevitable low and we witness how Terri releases the band from the Good Vibrations label for “£500 and a signed copy of a Shangri-Las record”.\nWith a marriage falling apart, mounting debts at the record shop and next to no revenue, a fundraising concert at the Ulster Hall sets the scene for the rousing finale and our lead’s poignant rendition of Sonny Bono’s Laugh At Me.\nA standing ovation gave way to the ‘national anthem’ as the raw opening bars of Teenage Kicks started up and the audience sang every line back to the cast.\nGood Vibrations is a must-see – simple as that. The amount of energy fizzing off the stage is infectious and the cast of ten are exceptional. A transfer to the West End must surely follow.\n\n\nGood Vibrations runs at the Lyric Theatre until Saturday, October 6.

Today [Tuesday] we want to provide an update on our plans.\n\n\"It is our intention to be back up and trading again as soon possible. As you can appreciate, we are at the early stages on this and will confirm details as soon as possible. We hope that this will assist the on-going efforts to drive footfall into the city centre.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also asserted it was committed to reestablishing a shop presence in Belfast.\n\nBelfast City council Council welcomed the announcement Primark would donate to the wider City Recovery Investment Fund.\n\n“Primark is very keen to support small businesses in the city centre – in particular those that have been severely impacted by the fire.  The company has asked Belfast City Council to distribute this funding on its behalf,\" a Council spokesperson said.\n\n“Belfast City Council is developing a City Recovery Investment Programme which includes immediate, medium and longer term proposals to support businesses, re-establish and sustain high levels of trading the city centre in the lead up to Christmas and beyond, increase connectivity across the city centre, ultimately ensuring the city’s economic resilience.\n\n\"The contribution made by Primark will be an important part of that overall programme delivery.\"\n\nIn a statement, Belfast DUP MPs Nigel Dodds, Emma Little Pengelly and Gavin Robinson welcomed the donation.\n\nThey said: \"“Everyone is aware of the disruption that has been caused to Belfast City Centre as a result of the cordon in place around Bank Buildings. It is important that efforts continue to reduce that as quickly as possible and allow business to  to as much normality as possible.\n\n\"There are concerns about the impact of forecasted high winds over the next 24 hours and how this could affect the building. It is those risks which mean the safety cordon has to be kept in place, but we hope that progress can be made quickly.\n\n\"The donation made by Primark to the City Council’s recovery programme is a very welcome goodwill gesture.

He previously won nominations by Clare County Council and Kerry County Council.\n\n\nExtremely grateful to \n@TipperaryCoCo\n who have shown their faith in me today and elated to make it onto the ballot paper. The energy and enthusiasm I have been met with by people who are ready, willing and able to get involved in my campaign is truly humbling. \n#Aras18\n\n— Peter Casey  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPresidential election hopefuls must secure the support of four local authorities or 20 TDs and senators to stand in the election.\n\nMr Casey said he was “elated” to have made it on to the ballot paper.\n\n“The energy and enthusiasm I have been met with by people who are ready, willing and able to get involved in my campaign is truly humbling,” he tweeted as his candidacy was confirmed.\n\nLongford County Council also held a special meeting on Tuesday to vote to nominate a candidate for the election. Instead, Longford councillors decided against nominating a candidate after only one hopeful showed up to address them.\n\nMr Casey is now the third Dragons’ Den entrepreneur along with Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffy to run for president. However, he faces strong competition from the incumbent Michael D Higgins, who is currently leading the polls.\n\nSinn Fein unveiled Liadh Ni Riada as its candidate at the weekend.\n\nThe sixth candidate is mental health activist Senator Joan Freeman.\n\nMr Casey runs global recruitment firm Claddagh Resources. It operates from five locations across the world, including its European base in Buncrana, Co Donegal. He ides his time between Atlanta in the US and Ireland.\n\nSpeaking previously about his campaign to be president, Mr Casey said he was not running to lose and was prepared to spend up to 750,000 euro .\n\nAccording to polls, Mr Higgins is heading for a landslide victory.\n\nThe Red C opinion poll published in the Sunday Business Post put the current president at 67% support.\n\nBusinessman and presidential runner-up in 2011 Mr Gallagher came second at 15%, ahead of fellow Dragons’ Den star Mr Duffy at 6%.\n\nIn third place, 7% chose Ms Ni Riada, who was unveiled as Sinn Fein’s candidate on Sunday.\n\nMr Higgins, 77, can nominate himself as an independent candidate for another seven years in office.\n\nHowever, he has secured the backing of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Labour, who have agreed not to field candidates from their own parties.\n\nMr Gallagher, the 56-year-old businessman and former Dragons’ Den star from Ballyhaise, Co Cavan, finished second in the 2011 presidential election and is tipped for another runner-up position.\n\nHe won the backing of Roscommon, Mayo, Leitrim and Wexford councils, and was the first independent candidate to secure a nomination.\n\nMr Duffy, 58, will run as an independent candidate after securing his nomination by winning the backing of Waterford, Meath, Carlow and Wicklow councils.\n\nMs Freeman, the independent member of the Irish Seanad, psychologist and mental health activist from Dublin, earned the backing of Galway City Council as well as Galway County, Fingal and Cork County councils.\n\nNominations must be submitted by September 26 and the election will be held on October 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sweeping reforms needed within garda commission on future of policing suggests","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Commission set up to map out the future of Irish policing has suggested sweeping reforms are needed within the Garda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe report by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland proposes a new framework for policing, including the establishment of a new structure to address global security threats and terrorism, a new Ombudsman to address accountability and greater powers for the Garda Commissioner.\n\nThe Ombudsman which investigates complaints against the force should be given enhanced powers and a new name to deliver an advanced complaints system, and would supersede oversight bodies the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nNew Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said he would take time to review the report \n\n\n\n\nIt will carry out all investigations into iniduals, incidents, and systemic issues and police will no longer be investigating themselves.\n\nThe Garda has come under intense scrutiny in the last year and has been described as being in dire need of reform.\n\nA false breath test figures scandal in 2017 saw Taoiseach Leo Varadkar say “crucial and essential” Garda reform was needed.\n\nThe then Garda commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan stood down after dealing with a wide range of controversies, including the over-inflated breath test figures, the Disclosures Tribunal, which investigated how the force treats whistle-blowers, and a Public Accounts Committee investigation into financial mismanagement at Templemore Garda training college.\n\nThe Commission was established by the Government in May 2017 to develop a blueprint for the future of the service.\n\nA survey published in May showed that one in six frontline gardai may be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSeven gardai took their own lives in the past year.\n\nCommission chairman and former chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate Kathleen O’Toole said: “There are critical systemic issues related to structure, accountability mechanisms, management processes and culture that must be addressed.\n\n“There is an urgent need for comprehensive and fundamental change and it is imperative to deliver it now.”\n\nTuesday’s report said a new framework for national security, headed by a national security co-ordinator, would pool intelligence and provide long-term threat assessments.\n\nAn independent examiner of terrorism legislation would also be established to oversee how security legislation is implemented.\n\nOther proposed reforms include a new approach to policing and community safety, to tackle issues of visibility in certain communities, and a plan to deploy body-worn cameras.\n\nThe Commission has also recommended a “one-off targeted severance package that management can deploy to support restructuring and reform”.\n\nThe report also suggests appointments and promotions should no longer be within the remit of the Policing Authority, and will be handed back to the Garda, which could prove contentious for many within the force.\n\nIt has often been claimed promotions and appointments are open to favouritism and nepotism in the Garda, and many welcomed the Policing Authority promotion process as useful in the fight against cronyism.\n\n“The Commissioner must be given power to run the organisation otherwise the Commissioner is destined to fail.\n\n“We think it’s important that he should have the opportunity to select his own team,” Ms O’Toole said.\n\nGarda resources should be further directed to support key technology projects, and frontline police will be prioritised for the early roll-out of mobile technology.\n\nIssues related to the lack of available statistics in certain crimes like domestic violence, hate crimes and rape have been cited as those in need of appropriate data.\n\nMs O’Toole added: “Gardai are in some ways generations behind when it comes to technology.”\n\nNo budget or exact figure has been given for the roll-out of the 50 recommendations, but the Commission say they have been given reassurance by the Government that efforts will be made to implement a number of them.\n\n“I would not be here  I didn’t think the Government would commit to this and the issues that need to be addressed, through commitments made initially and throughout of the work of the commission,” Ms O’Toole added.\n\nThe new Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said he would take time to review the report.\n\n“The report will be the roadmap for our policing partners and An Garda Siochana for the next three to five years.\n\n“Some of the recommendations outline signicant cultural, staffing, structural and system changes.\n\n“As such, it is important that we carefully consider the implementation of this report.”\n\n\n\nThe Commission has approached policing from a fresh perspective\nCharlie Flanagan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister for Justice and Reform, Charlie Flanagan, also welcomed the report.\n\n“The Commission has approached policing from a fresh perspective and has redefined policing as a multi-disciplinary, cross-agency effort built on the foundation of protecting human rights.\n\n“Of particular note is its emphasis on policing as not only the prevention or detection of crime, but also the prevention of harm and protection of vulnerable people, and the implications of this for the whole of Government.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"adoption decisions not made hastily research finds","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

Scotland takes approximately two to three years, despite the Scottish Government having made an “explicit commitment” to making permanent arrangements for such children as early as possible, an academic has said.\n\nhttps:www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/adoption-decisions-not-made-hastily-research-finds-37329988.html\n\nhttps:www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/article37329986.ece/39632/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_239efc5d-f9a5-4f1e-9531-be5a1bf899ff_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdopting a child in Scotland takes approximately two to three years, despite the Scottish Government having made an “explicit commitment” to making permanent arrangements for such children as early as possible, an academic has said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nHelen Whincup from the the University of Stirling said there was no evidence decisions on adoptions were being made “hastily”.\n\nEven for children who have been in care from a very young age, where adoption is the “most appropriate option”, she said the procedure still took up to 36 months.\n\nMs Whincup led a team of academics from the universities of Stirling, York and Lancaster, who – in collaboration with the Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland – examined the cases of the 1,836 youngsters aged five and under who were taken into care in 2012-13.\n\nResearchers analysed data sent to the Scottish Government by all 32 local authorities across Scotland to find out what happened to the children over the next four years.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nHelen Whincup from Stirling University \n\n\n\n\nTheir findings, which will be unveiled at a conference in Stirling, showed that while it took an average of nine months for youngsters to be ed to their parents, the adoption process took an average two to three years.\n\nChildren Looked After Statistics  data showed 1,355 youngsters aged for under were placed with other family members, put into foster care, or went to live with adoptive parents in 2012-12.\n\nA further 481 youngsters were looked after while remaining at home with their parents.\n\nBy 2016 almost a third  of the 1,355 children who had been removed from the family home had been reunited with their parents.\n\nAbout half this number  had been adopted, while 6% were “moving towards adoption” and 2% had been placed on a permanence order, removing parental rights from their natural parents.\n\nJust over one in 10  of the children were being permanently cared for by other family members, while 32% continued to be looked after outside of the family home.\n\nThere were 2% of children who were no longer in care, but where there was no further information on where they were living.\n\nMs Whincup said: “What this tells us is that when the child is going home, this happens relatively quickly.\n\n“However, despite the Scottish Government’s explicit commitment to early permanence, other routes to secure a child’s care take much longer, even for our youngest children.\n\n“For those children where adoption is the most appropriate option, there is no evidence that this decision is taken hastily in Scotland.\n\n“In fact, the data shows rather the opposite – it takes approximately two to three years, even for those children who became looked after when they were very young.”\n\nAs well as analysing CLAS data and information from the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration, the academics interviewed a range of people involved in the processes, including social workers, foster carers and children.\n\nMaggie Grant, from Adoption and Fostering Alliance Scotland, added: “Some children told us about early experiences of abuse and neglect, and were also able to tell us what helped them feel secure, including keeping important things from their past safe.”\n\nResearchers are nowing moving into the second phase of the study, and will be tracking the children’s progress towards adolescence and beyond.\n\nA Scottish Government spokesman said: “We want to provide safe, stable, nurturing homes for children in care at the earliest opportunity and last year adoptions in Scotland for looked-after children reached their highest level.\n\n“We are supporting local authorities and partners – in health, children’s hearings, the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration and the courts – to develop projects to identy delays to securing permanence for looked-after children.\n\n“In addition the First Minister has established an independent care review that is looking at the legislation, practice, ethos and culture of the whole system to improve care for children and young people.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kent aims to create 1300 jobs in tech and innovation with new","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

And we cannot be complacent.”\n\nThe minister will be considering means of ensuring such journalism is funded.\n\nWright said that the deliberation on the form online regulation may take could also take time.\n\nHe said: “I apologise  it takes longer than people want, but I want to get it right.”\n\nWright said the Government will have to make clear what needs to be regulated and how, before he can comment on the timescale for regulation to be rolled out.\n\nThe head of Ofcom, Sharon White, spoke at the conference, saying that online media was subject to a “lottery of standards”.\n\nShe would not be drawn on whether Ofcom could regulate the online space in the UK.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"steam engine to return to mainline network","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

their five-wicket win over Sussex in the T20 Blast final on Saturday, the Pears were back in action on Tuesday morning in a County Championship match against Essex.\n\nAnd it didn’t quite go to plan as they quickly slipped to 32 for six – including this doozy of a dismissal.\n\n\n3⃣ ... 😬🙈\n#ESSvWOR\n \npic.twitter/iDa5LuHUTx\n\n— Essex Cricket  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a passage of play that nobody comes out of particularly well, with both Worcestershire batsmen ending up at the same end as Olly Westbury disagreed with Joe Clarke about whether or not a third run was there for the taking.\n\nBut as Westbury stood his ground at the non-striker’s end, Essex bowler Jamie Porter collected a throw from the deep and lobbed the ball waywardly in the vague direction of wicketkeeper Adam Wheater.\n\nSo bad was Porter’s throw that Westbury probably would have had time to make his ground twice over, aided by a fumble from Wheater, but he remained stock still before trudging back to the dressing room as the bails were removed.\n\n\nI’m not sure we can credit Ports with that run out...his throw was heading for the boundary!\n— Mark Wallis  \nSeptember 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nA moment to forget for pretty much everyone concerned.\n\nWorcestershire, who were bowled out for 94 before lunch, entered the match bottom of Division One with two games to play and desperately needing a win to keep their hopes of survival alive.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"hundreds line up for free supplies in isolated town following florence deluge","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

An olive-green military forklt moved around huge pallets loaded with supplies.\n\nFour days after Florence blew ashore and began unloading more than two feet of rain that paralysed much of North Carolina, Wilmington was still virtually cut off from the rest of the state, with just one road tentatively open as a supply route. \n\nOfficials said they will open roads as flooding recedes and downed trees and power lines are cleared away. It is not clear when that might happen.\n\nItems have been brought into the city by big military trucks and helicopters, which also have been used to pluck hundreds of desperate people from on top of homes and other structures.\n\n“Thank you,” a shirtless Willie Schubert mouthed to members of a Coast Guard helicopter crew who picked up him and his dog Lucky from a house encircled by water in Pollocksville on Monday. It was not clear how long he had been stranded.\n\n\nWe know a lot of folks are trying to get back to the area. PLEASE be safe and obey all closed road signs. Some have water issues remaining others have dried out but have road issues.

Authorities in Virginia said one person was dead after an apparent tornado.\n\nThe rain finally stopped and the sun peeked through on Monday, but North Carolina Gov Roy Cooper warned that dangerously high water would persist for days. \n\nHe urged residents who were evacuated from the hardest-hit areas to stay away because of closed roads and floodwaters that submerged entire communities.\n\n“There’s too much going on,” he said.\n\n\nInterstate 40 at Pender County \npic.twitter/d8XYXCZRsE\n\n— MG Jim Trogdon PE  \nSeptember 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\nUtility crews from multiple states worked to restore power, and outages were down from a high of more than 900,000 to about 320,000 homes and businesses, nearly all in North Carolina.\n\nCrews conducted about 700 rescues in New Hanover County, where Wilmington is located. \n\nMayor Bill Saffo said he was working with the governor’s office to get more fuel into Wilmington.\n\n“At this time, things are moving as well as can be in the city,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"council investing community centre provision across derry","story":"\nMembers of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee were recently provided with an update on a iety of projects.\n\nThe investment is a key strand of the Council’s overall agreed ambitious capital plan that forms part of the Council’s Strategic Inclusive Growth Plan to invest in new and refurbished community centre development across the Council area.\n\nAmong the projects currently included in the capital plan that updates were provided on are - Top of the Hill, Lincoln Courts, Shantallow, Galliagh, Culmore, Brandywell/ Daisyfields and Ballymagroarty /Hazelbank .\n\nFunding for these projects has been allocated by Council with additional external funding required to be made available from the Department for Communities subject to the approval of appropriate business cases and confirmation of Central Government Departmental funding.\n\nMembers were informed at the meeting that the plans outlined at the meeting is one of a number of strands of the overall capital investment plan for community facilities across the Council area and including rural areas.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nKaren McFarland Director of Health and Communities with the Council added that a number of community facilities at Victoria Bridge, Plumbridge and Glebe are complete and ongoing work is progressing at Springhill and Strathfoyle to further develop localised provision.

replacement lighting, and new lighting columns.\n\nIn the application, Translink state that the upgrade works are aimed at ‘addressing a number of current health \u0026amp safety issues within the depot’, and will also see parking lining, pedestrian lining and a new fence.\n\nThe works,  approved, will also see the replacement of the current vehicle access barriers and the installation of new

The drainage work was completed recently, but the road is to be closed again between September 17 and 28 from 9am to 4.30pm daily.

Resurfacing work is also proposed but there is no confirmation when this will start.\n\nCllr Curran added: \u0026ldquoAll road improvement work across the district is welcome and roads officials deserve praise for their commitment to address routes which require investment.

Bredagh cruised to a 3-9 to 1-7 win over Annaclone and Saul upset the odds with a sensational 1-15 to 1-6 win over a fancied Ballymartin outfit in Newcastle.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe JFC semi-finals draw was also made on Monday night and sees Ardglass take on Teconnaught, with Aughlisnafin facing the winners of tonight\u0026rsquos replay between Kilclief and Aghaderg in Castlewellan.\n\nArdglass displayed a great tactical awareness to get the better of Dromara on a 2-7 to 0-11 scoreline at Drumaness on Saturday and Teconnaught beat St Paul\u0026rsquos 3-16 to 0-11 after they produced a storming second half performance.\n\nAughlisnafin, as expected, edged out Newry Mitchels 1-13 to 2-7 at a wet and windy Mayobridge on Monday night and they will most certainly fancy their chances against either Kilclief or Aghaderg. The six semi-finals will be played over the weekend of September 28-30.\n\nMeanwhile, Portaferry and Ballygalget lock horns on Saturday in a bid to join Ballycran in the Senior Hurling Championship decider.

While the move has been welcomed by the SDLP, it has been criticised by the DUP.\n\nThe current Strangford Westminster constituency is to be broken up and renamed Mid Down, covering an area stretching from Banbridge to Newtownards which will have an electorate of almost 77,800.\n\nPortaferry and a large part of the Ards peninsula, also currently in Strangford, will move into North Down.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe new Mid Down constituency will also include part of the current Lagan Valley constituency which is to become defunct under the revised proposals.\n\nIn addition to the transfer of the Killyleagh area into South Down, plans to move the Crossgar area from the constituency into Strangford have been aborted, while it is proposed to move Loughbrickland into South Down from Lagan Valley.\n\nThe new plan illustrates how Northern Ireland\u0026rsquos political borders could look like in years to come and there has been a mixed political reaction to moving Killyleagh back into South Down and retaining Crossgar in the constituency.\n\nRowallane councillor Billy Walker believes people in Killyleagh will be \u0026ldquounhappy about plans to move the area into South Down which is currently represented by Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard who does not take his seat at Westminster.\n\n\u0026ldquoCurrent Strangford MP Jim Shannon is recognised as one of the hardest working MPs at Westminster and while there are plans to create a new Mid Down constituency, I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of people in the Killyleagh area want to be represented at the heart of government in London by an MP who takes his seat, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoBallynahinch, Saintfield, Killyleagh, Derryboye and Kilmore and part of Crossgar are currently in Strangford and I have no doubt voters in these areas will want to be part of the new Mid Down constituency. From my point of view, I would like to see all of Crossgar in it.\n\nCllr Walker said he hopes the proposed boundary changes will not be rubber stamped, suggesting there is not an appetite for change among people in Killyleagh to move back into South Down.\n\nBut former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie, believes the retention of Crossgar in South Down and the plan to reinstate Killyleagh in the constituency is welcome.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt would appear that the integrity of the historic constituency of South Down has remained intact with the addition of Loughbrickland on the western flank. However, it would appear that the Boundary Commission has been listening to submissions made at their inquiries and has retained Crossgar within the historic boundary, she continued.\n\n\u0026ldquoAn interesting feature has been the addition of the Killyleagh electoral ward which was removed from the constituency about 22 years ago.

Their journey will taken over four months and will be fraught with danger from disease, crocodiles, swamps and fast-flowing rapids.\n\nNo-one has ever canoed over such a long stretch of the Nile and Marcus admits that their trip will not be easy. \u0026ldquoIt is a little frightening even thinking about it, but I am looking forward to it immensely, he said.\n\nMarcus is now living in Liverpool where he studied at the local university, and has been planning the expedition for the past two years.\n\nAfter travelling to the Ugandan border the eight will head north down the river through Sudan and Egypt. It is a journey which will take them through the Sudd \u0026mdash probably the world\u0026rsquos largest swamp \u0026mdash and through the foaming Nile cataracts.\n\nMarcus began canoeing at Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre outside Castlewellan, but only took up the sport seriously at university.\n\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never tackled anything as formidable as the Nile before, he said. \u0026ldquoPerhaps one of the hardest things has been trying to arrange sponsorship. We have each spent months writing letters to ious firms asking them for equipment. The cost of the trip will be around \u0026pound8,000.\n\nThe group are disappointed that they will not be able to travel over the complete  of the Nile because of the situation in Uganda, which has made it too dangerous to start at the head waters.\n\nHowever, they will still have the satisfaction of travelling over much of the ground covered by the Victorian explorers who struggled for decades to trace the Nile\u0026rsquos source.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash A \u0026pound28,000 scheme to deepen the harbour at Ardglass will begin within the next two weeks. Already a huge dredger has been brought to the site and a few explanatory digs have been made.\n\nThe work, when completed early in the new year, will allow fishing boats to land their catches alongside the market. At present it is impossible for the boats to unload their catches at the fish market during low tide.\n\nWith only some three feet of water modern day trawlers are just too big to lie in the harbour without bumping the bottom. The new scheme will aim at providing approximately ten feet of water at low tide, thus enabling the biggest of the boats to unload at the fish market.\n\nUntil then the boats will have to follow their usual and unsatisfactory custom of unloading at the main pier and having their catch transported by trucks to the market.\n\nNot since 1940 had dredging been carried out at Ardglass and the work will go a long way towards restoring Ardglass as a major fishing port.\n\nSTRANGFORD LOUGH \u0026mdash A secret experiment on Strangford Lough has helped scientists towards a major breakthrough in a three-year battle to harness wave energy as a source of power.\n\nResearch at Queen\u0026rsquos University in Belfast has now produced a revolutionary type of ocean buoy which could supply enough electricity for a town of 15,000 people. A chain or such buoys off our coast could one day be one of our main sources of power.\n\nDetails of the exciting new scheme were only released yesterday, though the Strangford Lough experiment took place almost a year ago. It was that small-scale which gave the scientists enough information to produce a design for a full-scale device.\n\nFour or five similar experiments are currently being considered by the Department of Energy in Britain for use in a wave energy programme and researchers at Queen\u0026rsquos are hoping their buoy will be one of those chosen.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash The beautul peninsular town of Portaferry has been chosen for a major award in the Central Gardens Association Best Kept Villages and Towns competition for 1978.\n\nThe Association awarded Portaferry the title of \u0026lsquothe small town showing most improvement\u0026rsquo for its landscaping and environmental quality.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash News that a proposed sheltered housing scheme for Comber has been axed by the planners brought an angry reaction from local councillors this week.\n\nArds Borough councillors were told that a planning application from the Fold Housing Association for a housing scheme for the elderly in Castle Street had been refused on several grounds.\n\nComber councillor John Shields said: \u0026ldquoIt is this ridiculous that this application has been turned down. I think every effort should be made to accommodate the old people in the area.\n\nA planning official, Mr Des Stevens, said that the main objections had been that the department was not prepared to locate old people in an area where there was industrial development and also that there would be a problem of providing access for a housing scheme.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Tote betting s to Downpatrick racecourse for the first time in eight years at the end of the month.

Both rings are decorated.\n\nThe broken ring\u0026rsquos surface is ided into a number of panels, some with a cross-style mot. The decoration, though not as accomplished as on other examples, does compare with similar patterns which experts suggest characterise a series of silver rings of 12th-century date from both Ireland and Britain.\n\nThe intact rings decoration includes a flower pattern and traces of lettering which may read a version of \u0026lsquoIESU REX EXAUDI NOS\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash \u0026lsquoJesus, king, hear us\u0026rsquo, but this is not certain.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe nature of the lettering, which is termed Lombardic, suggests the 13th or 14th century while the style of the ring overall is consistent with this date. As the two rings from Bright dfer little from each other in date, it is assumed they were lost or deposited together at the same time.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are of interest in illustrating the range of finger rings being worn in east Ulster in the late middle ages and might have been made locally or imported.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe ruins of Bright Castle, believed to have been built between the 15th and 16th century, are close by and may have been built on an earlier settlement. If the rings were in circulation for a reasonable  of time it is even possible that they could have been owned and eventually lost by the castle\u0026rsquos occupants.\n\nMeanwhile, a fragment of Viking \u0026lsquohack silver\u0026rsquo, dating back to the ninth or 10th century, has been discovered near Drumbo.\n\nExperts say the piece, which is less than 2cm in , would originally have been part of a larger item such as an arm ring or bracelet.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Scientist elected as international council member  ","story":"\t\t\t\nA CARRYDUFF scientist has been awarded membership of a prestigious international body for food science and technology.\n\nProfessor Margaret Patterson has been elected as one of the seven council members of the International Union of Food Science and Technology .\n\nIUFoST represents more than 150,000 food scientists and technologists in over 60 countries throughout the world.

His greeting at a youth Mass in Galway where he declared \u0026lsquoyoung people of Ireland, I love you\u0026rsquo became a stand out moment, replayed on television on countless occasions since. My own childhood involved attending Mass at the Graan and serving as an altar boy in St Michael\u0026rsquos Church in Enniskillen with many of my primary school classmates. We were lucky too that for much of my childhood our pastoral leadership was led by Father Brian D\u0026rsquoArcy who preached a message of tolerance, ersity in the church, compassion for the complexities of le and the experiences that shape them. Even when a stream of disturbing disclosures arose that challenged the Church and its response to clerical abuse and coverup, Father Brian\u0026rsquos consistently strong and unequivocal demand for accountability, truth, justice and recovery for victims offered a pathway for the institutional church to remain connected with its members.\n  My own le journey took me to Dublin in 1999 and what I discovered very quickly was that the message of compassion, openness and truth that I had faithfully followed and listened to every Sunday did not reflect the views and actions of the hierarchy either in Ireland or in the Vatican. Like many people of faith I found this not just challenging but chilling.\u0026nbsp\n  As I embarked on a legal career in human rights law I spent many days hearing story after story of adults recalling their experiences of abuse and brutal actions at the hands of clergy and lay people at the Residential Institutions Redress Board.\u0026nbsp\n  Those stories will never leave me. Sine then, the full impact of church and state abuse has come through my office door clerical sexual abuse, church authority cover ups, Magdalene laundries, the cruel operation of mother and baby homes, where many single mothers lost their babies to a regime of illegal adoptions and told they had committed a mortal sin. We have been witness to church intolerance towards lone parents, women, advocates of shared education, access to certain healthcare services, separated couples and the LGBT community.\n  And so when I was given a ticket to the Pope\u0026rsquos Mass last weekend I thought long and hard about attending. I could see that for many people of faith this was an opportunity to gather as a church community and celebrate their faith, their God and their Christianity.\u0026nbsp\n  On the other hand I could see that for many victims of the Church the Pope\u0026rsquos visit resurrected those deep seated and enduring feelings of hurt, trauma and damage that has never been properly addressed with actions.\u0026nbsp\n  So many victims have said to me that the abuse itself is not nearly as bad as the culture of cover up, the systemic efforts to sideline and disbelieve victims, to hide evidence and wrongdoers from a process that would lead to truth, justice and love for the victim and their families.\u0026nbsp\n  So I ended up last Sunday foregoing the papal Mass and standing for truth with nearly 10,000 other citizens in Dublin City Centre. It was a personal choice. I am glad now I made that choice. I am sad that the Vatican and the leadership of the Church still don\u0026rsquot get it. Still don\u0026rsquot acknowledge that abuse wasn\u0026rsquot simply perpetrated on children by inidual wrongdoers but that their many violations were facilitated, covered up and enabled by Bishops, Archbishops and Cardinals all the way to the Vatican.\n  Ireland has changed utterly since 1979. It is reflected in all the societal changes that have taken place in the last thirty nine years. It is reflected in the fact that the people of Dublin were much more interested and welcoming of the Queen than the Pope.\u0026nbsp\n  It turns out that Pope John Paul was wrong when he said back in 1979 that he loved the young people of Ireland. The Church showed anything but love to all those they have hurt and damaged.\u0026nbsp\n  They have even now showed a lamentable lack of capacity to lead, to acknowledge, to take ownership of their failings and to take actions rather than deliver honeyed words. This visit was a massive opportunity to reverse the damage caused. The opportunity has been missed.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

here\u0027s what we know so far.\n                \n\nIs there a weather warning in place for Storm Ali?\n\nYes. The original yellow status severe weather warning has been upgraded to amber. The warning is valid throughout Northern Ireland from 8:00am to 5:00pm on Wednesday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat does an amber weather warning from the Met Office actually mean?\n\nThere is an increased likelihood of impacts from severe weather, which could potentially disrupt your plans.\n\nThis means there is the possibility of travel delays, road and rail closures, power cuts and the potential risk to le and property.\n\nYou should think about changing your plans and taking action to protect yourself and your property.\n\nYou may want to consider the impact of the weather on your family and your community and whether there is anything you need to do ahead of the severe weather to minimise the impact.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\nWhat should I expect when Storm Ali arrives?\n\nThe following is a list of what to expect issued by the Met Office:\n\n- Flying debris is likely and could lead to Injuries or danger to le\n\n- Probably some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs or damage through falling trees and branches breaking\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n- Longer journey times and cancellations likely, as road, rail, air and ferry services may be affected\n\n- Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage\n\n- Some roads and bridges likely to close\n\n- Large waves could affect coastal roads, sea fronts and properties\n\n\nWhy is the storm called Ali?\n\nThe Met Office officially named the storm, Ali on Tuesday morning.\n\nLast week, the Met Office and Met Eireann released the names to be given to storms in 2018/19.\n\nAli is the first name in the list so the storm is the first to be named since the new names were published.\n\nThe next storm will be called Bronagh.\n\n\nHow strong is the storm expected to be?\n\nStorm Ali is expected to bring a very windy spell of weather with gusts of 65-75 mph inland.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n
