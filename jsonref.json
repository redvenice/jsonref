A paper published by SAGE last week suggested two doses of the Pfizer vaccine is good enough to protect against all known variants.Public Health England\u0027s Dr Susan Hopkins said the agency was \u0027still investigating\u0027 the cases and added there is \u0027no evidence that the variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective\u0027. \u0027The numbers are still low but certainly in London right now, B.1.617 and its subtypes are the only variant that appears to be growing,\u0027 Professor Pagel told MailOnline yesterday. \u0027That could be because it is outcompeting other strains, including the dominant Kent strain, or it could be circumstantial in that there were some spreading events that happened that, just by chance, were the Indian strain.\u0027However, I think the experience of India and now its neighbours do provide plenty of reason to be cautious and assume that B.1.617 is more transmissible.\u0027PHE has designated the Indian strains \u0027variants under investigation\u0027 because they are not well understood. The Kent and South Africa variants are \u0027variants of concern\u0027 because they are known to spread faster and escape some types of immunity – this means officials do surge testing to stamp out the South Africa variant when it\u0027s found, but they don\u0027t currently for India. Another 357,229 Covid cases and 3,449 new fatalities were recorded by the health ministry in India yesterday but medics believe the real figures could be between five and 10 times higher. Some have suggested the fast-spreading Kent variant could be behind the surge – similar patterns were seen when it took hold in the UK and Europe.But others say it was a perfect storm of rules that weren\u0027t tight enough, people\u0027s inability to keep social distancing and also new variants emerging. Data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute suggests it detected 100 test samples with the Indian variants in the most recent week, up from 52 in the week to April 10. This does not include tests from people travelling internationally.During that time the proportion of national cases they accounted for rose from one per cent to 2.4 per cent. Dr Pagel also said the proportion nationally was slightly higher, at around 4 per cent.This ate into the market share of the Kent variant, which fell from 97.8 to 96.2 per cent of cases. The Brazil and South Africa variants together account for less than one per cent.They have now been found in dozens of local authorities across the country with hotspots in London and the Midlands, and Public Health England has officially confirmed 400 infections caused by the viruses.As well as Lambeth (46 per cent of cases) and Harrow (36 per cent), the Indian variants also made up large proportions in Eastleigh, Hampshire (31 per cent) Bromley (25 per cent) Bolton (24 per cent) Stafford, Haringey and Hounslow (22 per cent).Professor Pagel: \u0027It rapidly became dominant in India and, again the sequenced data there is sparse, but early modelling shows that it might well be more transmissible than our B.117 Kent strain. \u0027What we have also seen in India is that B.1.617.2 is becoming the dominant subtype – exactly the same pattern we see here in the UK. \u0027While this could reflect the situation in India through importation, the Sanger data tries to exclude travel related cases or surge testing and we still the rise of B.1.617.2 in that.\u0027So we cannot be definitive. But that doesn\u0027t mean we should be complacent either – as so often with Covid, waiting to be absolutely sure is waiting too long.\u0027          Although the Sanger Institute data tries to filter out test results from people who have travelled internationally, its numbers likely reflect cases that are parts of clusters than began with a traveller.  India is now on Britain\u0027s red list, meaning only UK residents and citizens are allowed to make the journey into the country. They must quarantine for 10 days in a hotel and test themselves three times – before departure and then twice during self-isolation."},{"url":null,"title":"Commuting Britons likely catch Covid walking cycling work data suggests","story":"Share this article This result was based on a sample size of 10,516 people who were sent a Covid swab between March 20 and April 16. Just 31 tested positive.For those getting to work via car or taxi the risk was 30 per cent - based on swabs of 64,122 people, of which 160 were positive.Those who went to work by train or bus were found to be 8 per cent less likely to test positive than people working from home. But only 5,773 people were included in this group and just 10 were diagnosed with the virus, creating wide confidence intervals.The ONS said that because of this, the risk compared to working from home could be as high as 90 per cent.Riding in a train or bus was the most risky method of transport for every month bar one since the study started in October 3 last year.During all of the UK nations\u0027 various national lockdowns public transport was restricted for all but essential travel.Even though the ban was lifted most recently on April 12, levels have still not bounced back to pre-pandemic figures, which is reflected in the ONS\u0027 findings.Employees were also told to work from home if possible, but that decision has now been left with employers to decide, despite vanishingly low infection numbers.  Professor Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, told MailOnline it is nearly impossible to draw too many conclusions as to which method of transport is safest from the ONS\u0027s dataset.He said: \u0027The interpretation is really, really difficult. That’s for two reasons. \u0027First, there are huge confidence intervals (margins of statistical error) around these estimates, and that’s fundamentally because very few people in the ONS samples are testing positive these days.\u0027There were only 10 people in the ONS sample who travelled by bus or train and tested positive in the March to April 16 period. You’re never going to be able to get precise estimates from 10 positive tests.\u0027The second reason is there are differences between people who use different means of transport to work apart from their transport means, he said.Professor McConway added: \u0027So we can’t even be sure that the means of travel actually causes any difference at all to the risk. \u0027My guess would be that it probably does, but these results can’t show that. \u0027So, for instance, the data can’t tell you whether someone who currently travels by bike would be safer if they travelled by train or bus instead, because we don’t know enough about what causes the observed differences in risks. \u0027It might make no difference at all to their risk, or it might make a big difference.\u0027He said travelling by public transport is \u0027surely safer than it was\u0027 because cases are now so low.But he warned that as offices open up again and people return to work, it is possible trains and buses would become crowded again and the risk of transmission could rise.Dr Joe Grove, a virologist at University College London, told MailOnline: \u0027It’s difficult to think of a mechanism by which the risk associated with bus and train would drop whilst other modes of transport stayed the same. \u0027What is clear is that the national risk continues to drop — irrespective of what you’re doing — thanks to lockdown and vaccination, and we should keep up the hard work and be optimistic for the future.\u0027Boris Johnson urged to consider lifting \u0027work from home\u0027 guidance next month"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus real world data proves Pfizer Covid jab 77 98 effective","story":"Share this article  Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u0027It\u0027s very positive...

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

File photograph: Joseph PreziosoAFP via Getty ImagesThe first “tweaked” vaccine against the worrying coronavirus variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil has successfully neutralised them in laboratory trials, the US company Moderna has said.The results of the small trial suggest that boosters against the variants will be feasible and could potentially be rolled out this year to counter the threat from variants that have appeared around the world and are feared in some cases to be more transmissible or partially vaccine-resistant.Leading companies have been racing to produce adapted versions of their Covid-19 vaccines.Pfizer-BioNTech, which has a similar mRNA vaccine to Moderna’s, and AstraZeneca are also in the process of developing tweaked vaccines against the South African variant, B1351, and the Brazilian variant, P1, which appear to be the major threat to current immunisation programmes.Moderna became the first to announce results on Wednesday night. They appear to be very positive, although only basic information from an initial analysis of results is available so far.The US company has tested both a booster shot of its standard Covid vaccine and also a tweaked version of the vaccine in people who have previously had the full double dose. Twenty adults were recruited for each arm of the trial, or 40 in total.Two weeks after the new jab, Moderna says both the booster shot and the tweaked vaccine increased the antibodies in the blood that can neutralise the two variants of concern.But the tweaked vaccine – called mRNA-1273.351 and designed specifically to combat the South African and Brazilian variants, which have similar mutations to the spike protein – produced higher levels of neutralising antibodies than the standard booster shot, mRNA-1273.Moderna says it is also running a trial in which people are given a mixture of the booster and the vaccine specifically designed against the variant. It has submitted the early results as a paper to a pre-print server, it said in a statement. Once the combined trial is complete, it will produce a paper that will be published with peer review.“As we seek to defeat the ongoing pandemic, we remain committed to being proactive as the virus evolves. We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective against these newly detected variants,” said Stephane Bancel, CEO of Moderna.“Our mRNA platform allows for rapid design of vaccine candidates that incorporate key virus mutations, potentially allowing for faster development of future alternative variant-matched vaccines should they be needed ... We will continue to make as many updates to our Covid-19 vaccine as necessary to control the pandemic.”The vaccines have not been trialled in the field these are blood samples analysed in the lab. But the regulatory authorities have said they would not need to go through the rigorous large-scale trials that were necessary for the original vaccines to obtain emergency approval.The company said there were few side-effects from the vaccines and those that were reported were mild. Apart from pain at the injection site, the most common reported side-effects were fatigue, headache, muscle pain and joint pain. – "},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: iStockAlmost half of Ireland’s children have been comfort-eating through the Covid crisis, and increasingly stressed-out parents are struggling to wean them off the biscuit tin, according to a new report from the State’s food safety watchdog.The Safefood research, published on Thursday morning, reveals that almost 50 per cent of parents and s say their children have been eating more treats since the start of the pandemic, while a similar percentage are finding it difficult to ration treats.Biscuits, crisps, chocolate and sweets are the second-most-consumed food group by children, with almost a quarter of all meals featuring food and drinks high in fat, salt and sugar. Safefood said parents should ease back on the treats.However, a spokeswoman said it was “completely understandable, given the year we have all had to get through”, that more junk food was being consumed, and she stressed that Safefood was not trying to make anyone feel guilty.It has launched a new campaign, in conjunction with the HSE, which focuses on the “critical moment” when a child asks for a treat, and is offering support to parents taking a stand in saying no in order to restart their kids on the way to healthier habits.Make a plan“This past year has not been easy for parents and has had a significant impact on what we eat and how active we are as families,” said Safefood nutrition specialist Joana Da Silva.” We know that physical lockdowns, home-schooling and a lack of social contact have all contributed to this situation. But as measures are slowly eased, it brings the hope that parents can restart those healthy habits at home.”She said parents need a plan, “which will be different for every family for those who might have treats every day, this might mean aiming for a treat-free day or giving treats a break at one part of the day, for example after school. Once parents have set a goal, they’ll need to agree this with all the family. Everybody has to be in this together if it’s going to work.”Margaret O’Neill of the HSE accepted that breaking the treat habit would be a “daily challenge for a while” but expressed confidence that “once the break is made, it will get easier. Making small, gradual changes and taking breaks from treats will help you succeed in making healthy snacking become the norm at home.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord government in a flap about the cuckoo in the property nest","story":"“How are ordinary house buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?” File photograph: iStock The Taoiseach was right to look concerned.A new strain has emerged.“There is something new in what happened over the weekend. There is no point in saying there isn’t because there is,” he informed Cian O’Callaghan of the Social Democrats.A new strain of the old greed.This could be called the “Maynooth variant” although a number of TDs say it isn’t new but an infection which has been slowly but steadily taking root under the eye of recent governments in a dangerously weakening market.“Insidious” is what Labour’s Duncan Smith called it.Micheál Martin identified this new strain during Leaders’ Questions. Like all the others it came from the liquid Reit market and is spread by cuckoos and vultures, but the big difference to look out for here is the emergence of bulk-buying of completed housing schemes.And swooping. Swooping in and scooping up.“Unacceptable,” he said. “Not acceptable.”Investment companies should not be purchasing entire suburban estates. His Government is absolutely opposed to this.The Taoiseach’s sincerity was genuine. As was his obvious concern, not just for the inidual victims of the Maynooth variant and other financial mutations, but for his administration’s future and his own political skin.He will be aware of the disgusted reaction to the Business Post’s weekend revelation of an investment vehicle called Round Hill Capital sneakily nipping in and snaffling all but 22 out of 174 new homes in a Kildare housing estate, shouldering shocked inidual buyers aside with its massive buying power.So he will be aware that this sort of practice has to be stopped, not only to help first-time buyers find a home but also to stem the public anger over the unfair, inequitable and dysfunctional state of the housing market here.Raging contagionAt least an effective vaccine exists now for coronavirus, while opposition criticism of the Coalition’s handling of the pandemic has always been tinged with the cautious awareness that a raging contagion is oblivious to the rule of politics.If only the same could be said for the housing crisis, which was very much with us before the pandemic and looks well set to outlast it. The climate allowing global real estate investment trusts (Reits) to flourish was engineered nearly 10 years ago by Fine Gael minister for finance Michael Noonan when he introduced tax breaks to encourage these companies to invest here and boost an economy emerging from deep recession.And in they poured.They weren’t supposed to go mad looking for money by milking the lovely tax breaks until too many suffered and too many noticed. They should have confined themselves to reaping lucrative returns from commercial property and nondescript apartment blocks full of students, young buckos and renters who can’t afford to buy their own place.They weren’t supposed to start muscling in on proper suburban houses built for people who want to raise a family and set down strong roots in the electoral register.But Darragh is all set to move on the Reits. Rarin’ to go. He just needs to take a good run at it first.Further analysisHe told Morning Ireland on Tuesday that further analysis would have to be done before he acts. Outright banning of these companies (was anyone suggesting that?) “would be a pretty radical move and might have unintended consequences”.It was pointed out more than once to his boss in the Dáil on Wednesday that Germany managed to do it, banning such wholesale investment in specific areas of housing as opposed to the entire property market.Cian O’Callaghan reminded the Taoiseach that the Construction Industry Federation said in 2009 that 95 per cent of new apartment builds in 2009 were bought by these funds. Was the Government only interested in protecting houses in the suburbs? What about apartments?This is when Micheál broke the news of the new variant – the purchasing of entire estates. New to him, that is.Social Democrat co-leader Catherine Murphy told him of other estates in Kildare which have been similarly bought over by these financial cuckoos who arrive with their fat chequebooks and special tax breaks and elbow out ordinary buyers from their chosen nest.“How are ordinary buyers who scrimp and save for a mortgage supposed to compete with this?”The Government has to do something. People who hoped to buy one of the new houses had no chance. The local council couldn’t match the swooping vultures either and the local housing trusts, also interested in acquiring some of the homes, were bankrolled out of buying by the cuckoos.“There’s a skewed ideology at play here,” she said, promising that “every one of us” would sit overnight or for the weekend if they had to pass legislation.The Taoiseach was very sympathetic. “In respect of that swoop-in by that investor, we are going to deal with that. That is not acceptable.”Factory shipsBut it gets worse. These Reits are like international factory ships, steaming into Ireland and indiscriminately hoovering up all sorts of housing stock.Duncan Smith revealed that first-time buyers are not just losing out on new homes. The investment funds are leaving young couples “absolutely devastated” by sniffing out second-hand homes that might be within the reach of first-time buyers and offering over the odds before they even hit the market.Sinn Féin, particularly its housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin, has been calling for a number of years for the tax loopholes which give these global financial machines a huge advantage over local buyers to be closed. Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also long complained about the actions of the funds and brought the personal stories of powerless people’s lives turned upside down by them.Mary Lou McDonald was the first at Leaders’ Questions to demand action, and quickly, from the Government. She was followed by a succession of speakers from all Opposition parties.Even the venerable Bernard Durkan, Fine Gael stalwart, wanted to know what emergency legislation is planned. As a Kildare TD he is well aware of the housing heartbreak in the constituency.Outside the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar limply said the situation is “undesirable”.Meanwhile, Darragh (let’s not be too radical) O’Brien said what is needed is “a whole-of-government approach”.The Taoiseach indicated that O’Brien, along with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure, was working on a plan.

It is understood Sinn Féin feared losing one of its Foyle seats, where the SDLP has been bolstering its voter base, in next year’s poll.Respondents were “guaranteed confidentiality” by a review panel of “senior republicans” including elected and unelected officials from across Ireland.“There was a sense that people have really fallen out with us in Derry,” the source says, noting some replies suggest “we’re hated by the community we would seek to lead”.There was no suggestion of corruption. “But I am aware of the sense that people were getting jobs in the community sector... people were boxing-off jobs in peace funding and community development funding.“There was a sense in Derry that there was a cohort of people who were seen to be arrogant and dismissive and looking after themselves.”Furthermore, there was a “sense that a core group of people had run the party into disrepute”, the source says.A number of Sinn Féin figures in the city did not immediately respond to requests for comment.RumblingsDenis Bradley, former vice-chairman of the North’s Policing Board and a political observer, said there had been “rumblings for a couple of years at least” about unease with how Sinn Féin was operating in Derry.“You don’t get away with that in Derry. Eventually, people say what the hell is going on there it’s a small town, it’s not like Belfast or Dublin. I think all of those things came together.”Bradley also believes Sinn Féin “took Derry for granted”.“They said they were bringing all sorts of things to Derry,” he says. “But Derry is top of the pile when it comes to every bloody bad indices you can think of – health, employment, all the important day-to-day stuff. Derry is not in a good place, and it’s probably going to get worse.”Derry-based journalist Eamonn MacDermott says the “root and branch clear out” of Sinn Féin’s leadership in the city involved “everyone who was prominent in the party, as far as I can see”.He says it is “a very risky game Sinn Féin are playing”, adding that there are no obvious candidates to take over, a view shared by many party insiders.Parachuting someone in would be “extremely dangerous ”, says MacDermott, because people in the city “don’t like being told what to do” by outsiders.“It only takes 30 years to be accepted here.”"},{"url":null,"title":"how to improve weather predictions by reducing precision","story":"Atmospheric flow is chaotic: a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast.Weather forecasting relies on supercomputers used to solve the mathematical equations that describe atmospheric flow. The accuracy of the forecasts is constrained by available computing power.Processor speeds have not increased much in recent years and speed-ups are achieved by running many processes in parallel. Energy costs have risen rapidly: there is a multimillion-euro annual power bill to run a supercomputer, which may consume something like 10 megawatts of power.Early computer programs for weather prediction, written in the Fortran language, stored numbers in single precision. Each number had 32 binary digits or bits corresponding to a decimal number with about seven significant digits. Later models moved to double precision, each number having 64 bits and about 15 accurate decimal digits. This is now common practice.It seems self-evident that higher numerical precision would result in greater forecast accuracy, but this is not necessarily the case. Observations, which provide starting data, have only a few digits precision. We may know the temperature to one-tenth of a degree or the wind speed within one metre per second. Representing these values with several digits beyond the decimal point may be futile. It could be likened to giving somebody’s height to the nearest millimetre or, in double precision, the nearest micron, which is meaningless.Computational resourcesOf course, higher precision does reduce errors during the millions of computations needed for a forecast. But higher precision also implies greater storage requirements, larger data transmission volumes and longer processing times. Are these costs justified or can limited computational resources be used in more efficient ways?At the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, researchers have been seeking ways to reduce computing power. They have found that 64-bit accuracy is not necessary and that, with 32-bit numbers, forecasts of the same quality are obtained much faster. The 40 per cent saving can be used in other ways, like enhancing spatial resolution or increasing ensemble size. Thus, a reduction in numerical precision can result in improved forecast accuracy.Chaotic flowAtmospheric flow is chaotic: this means that a small change in the starting values can lead to a wildly different forecast. Chaos was well-described by meteorologist Ed Lorenz, who asked if a tiny disturbance could cause a storm in a far-away continent. The idea is encapsulated in a Limerick:Lorenz demonstrated, with skill,The chaos of heatwave and chill:Tornadoes in TexasAre formed by the flexesOf butterflies’ wings in BrazilTo allow for chaos, meteorologists run their models multiple times with slightly different starting values. The spread of these “ensembles” gives a measure of the confidence that can be placed in a forecast, and probabilities of different scenarios can be given. Researchers at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts were surprised that reducing numerical precision of the computations had little influence on the quality of the ensemble forecasts.For climate simulations, which run over decades or centuries, it is expected that, by using reduced number lengths, substantial savings will be possible. Some sensitive operations like matrix inversion may require double precision but the bulk of the calculations can be done with 32 bits. Current work is also testing half-precision (16-bit numbers) for non-sensitive components of the models.Peter Lynch is emeritus professor at UCD school of mathematics and statistics, University College Dublin.

Even allowing for rapid ongoing adaption of clean energy, it appears implausible that such ongoing increases in energy – and resource – consumption could occur without triggering catastrophic destabilisation of our planetary life support systems. Photograph: Getty ImagesMore than any other single factor, the defining characteristic of the modern era has been humanity’s use of cheap, plentiful energy. In the 20th century alone, humans deployed more energy than in all 20 previous centuries – combined.This trend has continued to accelerate into the first two decades of the 21st century, pandemic notwithstanding, and shows little sign of levelling off, let alone reversing. The dominant form of energy during this period has been via fossil fuel burning, and this is in turn is fuelling dangerous levels of disruption to the global climate system.While today’s levels of global energy usage are already altering the fundamental chemistry of the atmosphere and placing extreme pressures on the biosphere, the International Energy Agency projects that by 2050, world energy consumption will have increased by about 50 per cent.Some 17 per cent of total global energy use currently comes from renewables. Even allowing for rapid ongoing adaption of clean energy, it appears implausible that such ongoing increases in energy – and resource – consumption could occur without triggering catastrophic destabilisation of our planetary life support systems.Yet, despite our staggeringly high energy usage, the fact remains that “the basic material needs of billions of people across the planet remain unmet”, according to a recently published research paper titled “Providing decent living with minimum energy: A global scenario”.Burgeoning global populationThe authors set out to see if the basic needs of a burgeoning global population could, at least in theory, be met by mid-century while averting widespread ecological breakdown. Their findings were unexpectedly upbeat.Nor is this a purely academic exercise. After all, if there appears to be no possible alternative to the current growth-based system, it will almost certainly continue, despite the evident and escalating risks.World population reached three billion in 1960 by 2050 it will likely have at least trebled, to about 9-10 billion. Despite this dramatic population growth, the paper argues that by 2050, “global energy use could be reduced to 1960 levels” while still providing a decent basic standard of living for every person on Earth.This dramatic reduction would require a combination of advanced technologies and sharp reductions in energy demand to what it calls “sufficiency levels”, but the authors are adamant that “sufficiency” is far less austere than people assume. In fact, for the bulk of humanity, it would mean tangible improvements to their real living standards, such is the extreme level of global resource and income inequality today.The research calculated the minimum energy needed to provide all basic needs, from adequate heating and cooling to nutrition, education, healthcare and access to information technology.‘Drastic changes’“Our intention is to imagine a world that is fundamentally transformed, where state-of-the-art technologies merge with drastic changes in demand to bring energy (and material) consumption as low as possible, while providing decent material conditions and basic services for all”, the authors state. Only through such a radical transformation, they add, can human needs be met within critical planetary boundaries.At present, those daring to suggest alternatives to our current model of constant economic growth or promoting steady state economics are likely to be dismissed as new age cultists or “degrowth fetishists” trying to make everyone poor.The new study, according to lead author, Joel Millward-Hopkins of the University of Leeds, “offers a response to the cliched populist objection that environmentalists are proposing that we return to living in caves”.The paper points out that “inequality and especially affluence, are now widely recognised as core drivers of environmental damage”. Consider that in the year since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the collective wealth of the world’s billionaires has ballooned by some $3.9 trillion (€3.2 trillion) while hundreds of millions of the world’s poorest people were plunged deeper into poverty and financial insecurity as a result of the pandemic.Trickle-down economicsThis further debunks the concept known as trickle-down economics, the notion that tax breaks for the wealthy would somehow flow towards wider society. Resources are instead being rapidly siphoned upwards towards the already wealthy and economically powerful.The paper points out that current levels of energy usage “underpin numerous existential crises, resource scarcity and the geopolitical instabilities these issues can catalyse, especially in a growth-dependent global economy”. While there have been significant improvements in energy efficiency, these have “largely served to boost productivity and enable further growth”.Crucially, beyond a certain point, increases in energy use in a given society deliver little or no additional benefits to that society. The study envisages, with the aid of technologies, radical demand-side transformations that largely eliminate excessive consumption and focuses available resources instead on providing the conditions required for flourishing. These include basic physical health and safety, access to clean air and safe water, good quality (largely plant-based) nutrition, and the opportunity for social and political participation.Resolving the paradox of how to satisfy the needs of all while using far less energy and fewer resources depends on sharp global reductions in meat-eating, down by some 85 per cent in rich countries. A massive expansion of public transport globally would greatly reduce energy and emissions while allowing people to meet their transport needs without the expense of owning and running resource-intensive private cars.Globally, much of the existing housing stock needs to be replaced over time with modern buildings with very low heating and cooling energy requirements. This would be another vital step in achieving decent living conditions with far less energy than at present.The paper is “a great contribution that offers a fresh perspective”, according to Brian Ó Gallachóir, professor of energy engineering at UCC. “Rather than emissions per se, it looks at primary energy. As a thought piece around energy justice and citizenship, it has an interesting focus on iniduals as agents, not just consumers.”Ó Gallachóir also finds the timing of the study propitious. “We have just come through a year where things have happened that just 12 months ago seemed totally unachievable. Through the pandemic, we have tended to listen to science, and find political consensus,” factors he feels will be equally necessary in facing the coming global climate and energy crunch.Vast inequalitiesThe new study admits to having deliberately avoided what is likely the most problematic issue: how to we move from a world riven by vast inequalities, excessive and wasteful energy usage and prodigal overconsumption of finite resources to a utopian model where “decent living standards are provided universally and efficiently”?The authors dismiss what they term incrementalism, as seen in concepts such as “green growth” and ethical consumerism, which they see as little more than rebranding of the very economic system that is driving the ecological crisis.The notions of sufficiency and economic equality underpinning their modelling are, they concede, incompatible with current economic norms, “where unemployment and vast inequalities are systemic requirements, waste is often considered economically efficient and the indefinite pursuit of economic growth is necessary for political and economic stability”.Today’s 17 per cent share of renewable energy is about half of what the study estimates is needed to ensure universal “decent living standards” by 2050, and the renewables sector will almost certainly have doubled by mid-century.This means that, at least in theory, the total replacement of fossil fuels can be achieved without plunging the world into poverty and chaos. While this would entail heavily clipping the wings of the world’s most profligate economic high flyers, that may in time be seen as a small price to pay for a habitable future for all."},{"url":null,"title":"canada authorises pfizer covid 19 vaccine for ages 12 to 15","story":"Pfizer vaccine  is first to be allowed to be administered to people of younger age cohort in the country, the federal health ministry said on Wednesday. File photograph: Mehdi FedouachAFPCanada is authorising the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for use on children aged 12 to 15, the first doses to be allowed in the country for people that young, the federal health ministry said on Wednesday.Supriya Sharma, a senior adviser at the Canadian federal health ministry, said the Pfizer vaccine, produced with German partner BioNTech, was safe and effective in the younger age group.“We are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” she told reporters.Sharma and a health ministry spokesman said Canada was the first country to grant such an approval, but a Canadian representative for Pfizer later said Algeria permitted use of the vaccine for this age group in April. The Canadian health ministry said it had no information about the discrepancy.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to take a similar step “very soon,” US health officials said.Separately, authorities reported the third death of a Canadian from a rare blood clot condition after receiving AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. The man, who was in his 60s, lived in the Atlantic province of New Brunswick.Jennifer Russell, the chief medical officer of health in New Brunswick, said the province would continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine. Alberta reported a death from clotting on Tuesday and Quebec announced one on April 27th.“There will be rare cases where thrombosis will occur. However, the risks remain minimal compared to the risks, complications and potential consequences of Covid-19,” Russell told reporters.Inoculation bottlenecksCanada’s federal government has bought tens of millions of doses of vaccines but critics complain the pace of inoculation is lagging due to bottlenecks in the 10 provinces, which are responsible for administering the doses.Alberta will become the first province to offer Covid-19 vaccines to everyone aged 12 and over from May 10th, premier Jason Kenney said on Wednesday, a day after he introduced tighter public health measures to combat a third wave of the pandemic.Alberta, home to Canada’s oil patch, has the highest rate per capita of Covid-19 in the country, with nearly 24,000 active cases and 150 people in intensive care.About 20 per cent of the 1,249,950 cases of Covid-19 in Canada have been reported in people under the age of 19.

Photograph:  John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesOn Christmas Eve last year, as the Brexit negotiations were entering their final minutes, Michel Barnier sought out his British counterpart in a room in the European Commission’s Berlaymont headquarters.“After nine months of negotiations, it is the last time I would see David Frost and our final exchange is professional and cold,” Barnier, who was chief Brexit negotiator, writes in The Great Illusion: a secret Brexit diary (2016-2020)“He knows I know that until the last moment he has been trying to circumvent me by opening a parallel negotiating track with Ursula von der Leyen’s cabinet. And he knows it has not been successful.”Although he describes Frost as courteous, Barnier makes clear that he neither trusted the British negotiator nor admired his negotiating style. A few weeks earlier, when the British team were refusing to engage with issues of concern to the European side, Barnier told them their negotiating technique was a farce.Throughout his 500-page diary, which is published in French on Thursday and will appear in an English translation in October, Barnier is bewildered by the British approach to the talks. He never wavers from his conviction that Britain made a mistake in leaving the European Union but he is surprised again and again by the incompetence and self-delusion that informed London’s negotiating strategy.When Theresa May declared in Lancaster House that Britain wanted to leave the single market and the customs union but hoped to maintain many of their benefits, he could scarcely believe what he was hearing.“Have the consequences of these decisions been thought through, measured, discussed? Does she realise this rules out almost all forms of cooperation we have with our partners?” he writes.“I am amazed at the way the prime minister has shown her hand.”He is generous towards May, describing her as a courageous woman surrounded by a lot of men putting their personal interests ahead of those of their country. Boris Johnson was one of those men but Barnier is careful not to underestimate him and finds him to be an appealing, if “baroque”, personality.He enjoyed a warm relationship with David Davis but has little complimentary to say about the next Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, whom he describes as having a messianic glint in his eye.When Raab demanded that the Irish Border issue should be resolved as part of an overall agreement, he warned that the EU would otherwise be responsible for the impact of a no-deal Brexit in the North.‘The fault of the UK’“We are searching for solutions together. And Dominic, if this threat is the new line of your government, then the negotiations can end immediately. And I will prepare myself in the coming days to inform the European Parliament and member states. We will regard the failure as being the fault of the UK,” Barnier told him.From the start, the issue of the Border was central to the talks and Barnier is at his most passionate when he describes his personal commitment to the peace process and his feelings when he met people in Northern Ireland.“I promised myself in this negotiation not to fuel the polemics and attacks from the British tabloids, to pay attention to the words I use, to stick to the facts, the figures, the legal fundamentals, in short, to leave little room for emotion and feelings, for the sake of objectivity. But here in Ireland . . . it is difficult not tobe touched by the sensitivity, the emotion of those who express themselves, the memories that remind me of this tragedy,” he writes.Barnier describes former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar as “courageous”, praising his role in the abortion rights referendum. Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney is “always shrewd, methodical and well-informed” and Barnier singles out John Callinan from the Taoiseach’s office and Ireland’s former EU ambassador Declan Kelleher for praise.While May was hamstrung by the need to negotiate every step in the Brexit talks with her own party, Barnier maintained unity among the EU’s member-states by frequent visits to capitals and open channels of communication to the leaders.Johnson’s indifference to the truth and his pursuit of “dead cat” strategies and staged crises complicated the negotiations and when Frost opened the second phase of negotiations he told Barnier that the prime minister did not feel bound by the political declaration he agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement.The Internal Market Act, which included clauses that would have allowed the British government to unilaterally suspend the Northern Ireland protocol, was the trigger for Barnier’s final loss of trust in his negotiating partners. He suggests that Johnson waited until Donald Trump’s election defeat before withdrawing the offending clauses, fearful of their impact on his relationship with Joe Biden.La Grande Illusion – Journal secret du Brexit (2016-2020) is published by Gallimard.

File photograph: J Scott ApplewhiteAP PhotoBloombergUS president Joe Biden’s administration is throwing its support behind efforts to waive intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines in an effort to speed the end of the pandemic.United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced the US government’s position in a Wednesday statement, amid World Trade Organisation talks over easing global trade rules to enable more countries to produce more of the life-saving vaccines.“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,” Ms Tai said in the statement.But she cautioned that it would take time to reach the required global “consensus” to waive the protections under WTO rules, and US officials said it would not have an immediate effect on the global supply of Covid-19 jabs.“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,” said Ms Tai.“The Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible.”President Michael D Higgins has welcomed the move as one of “immense moral significance in international policy”. The President had criticised the international response to helping developing countries deal with the pandemic in a speech to mark May Day when he said that “in a most important respect, our solidarity at global level has been tested, and we have been found wanting”. But in a tweet late on Wednesday night, President Higgins praised the move by the US government to back the waiver: “This decision marks a moment of immense moral significance in international policy, putting global need ahead of any narrow considerations. “It has the potential to be exemplary, building hope in so many areas for a real new beginning in our mutual interdependence.” The WTO previously backed a similar waiver on vaccines to combating Aids and HIV in the past. The issue has been raised in recent weeks in the Dáil and Seanad as TDs and Senators urged the Government to use its influence to persuade the European Commission, which represents the EU at the WTO, to reverse its opposition to a waiver. Last week, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said there had been “too many simplistic conclusions drawn” on the issue. Ireland and the EU had shown moral leadership on the issue, he insisted, adding that Europe had led the charge in terms of vaccine production and export for the entire world. The EU through its pre-purchasing agreement “has done an awful lot to ensure proper research and production of vaccines, which are being exported all over the world, and the barriers have not been put up to stop it”.  The issue needed to be studied carefully because “the model that has evolved has resulted in unprecedented production of vaccines in record time”. Ms Tai’s announcement comes hours after WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke to a closed-door meeting of ambassadors from developing and developed countries that have been wrangling over the issue, but agree on the need for wider access to Covid-19 treatments, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said.Waiver panelThe WTO’s general council, made up of ambassadors, was taking up the pivotal issue of a temporary waiver for intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines and other tools, which South Africa and India first proposed in October.The idea has gained support in the developing world and among some progressive politicians in the west.Mr Rockwell said a WTO panel on intellectual property was set to take up the waiver proposal again at a “tentative” meeting later this month, before a formal meeting on June 8th-9th.No consensus, which is required under WTO rules, was expected to emerge from the ambassadors’ two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday.But Mr Rockwell pointed to a change in tone after months of wrangling.“I would say that the discussion was far more constructive, pragmatic.“It was less emotive and less finger pointing than it had been in the past,” Mr Rockwell said, citing a surge in cases in places such as India.“I think that this feeling of everyone-being-in-it-together was being expressed in a way that I had not heard to this point.”Authors of the proposal, which has faced resistance from many countries with influential pharmaceutical and biotech industries, have been revising it in hopes of making it more palatable.Ms Okonjo-Iweala, in remarks posted on the WTO website, said it was “incumbent on us to move quickly to put the revised text on the table, but also to begin and undertake text-based negotiations”.“I am firmly convinced that once we can sit down with an actual text in front of us, we shall find a pragmatic way forward” that is “acceptable to all sides”, she said.Co-sponsors of the idea were shuttling between different diplomatic missions to make their case, according to a Geneva trade official who was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter.A deadlock persists, and opposing sides remain far apart, the official said.CopyrightThe argument, part of a long-running debate about intellectual property protections, centres on lifting patents, copyrights and protections for industrial design and confidential information to help expand the production and deployment of vaccines during supply shortages.The aim is to suspend the rules for several years, just long enough to beat down the pandemic.The issue has become more pressing with a surge in cases in India, the world’s second-most populous country and a key producer of vaccines, including one for Covid-19 that relies on technology from AstraZeneca. Proponents, including WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, note that such waivers are part of the WTO toolbox and insist there is no better time to use them than during the once-in-a-century pandemic that has taken 3.2 million lives, infected more than 437 million people and devastated economies.More than 100 countries have come out in support of the proposal, and a group of 110 members of US Congress, all fellow Democrats of Mr Biden, sent him a letter last month that called on him to support the waiver.Opponents say a waiver would be no panacea.They insist that production of coronavirus vaccines is complex and simply cannot be ramped up by easing intellectual property, and say lifting protections could hurt future innovation. – With Associated Press reportersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Moderna\u0026#39s \u0026#39tweaked\u0026#39 Covid vaccine effective against Brazil and South Africa variantsBoris Johnson: Tories have delivered more in four years than Labour did in decadesPeloton recalls £3,000 treadmills following death of a child‘Illogical’ plans to make vaccinated travellers take Covid tests ‘must be ditched’Rural crime rising three times faster than rest of the countryRoyal Navy ships ordered to Jersey as French fishermen prepare blockadeJan Leeming: was my jewellery show idea hijacked for All That Glitters?Boris Johnson risks breaking Tory manifesto pledge with \u0026#39incredibly expensive\u0026#39 social care reform plansExclusive: Ministers to ban prosecutions of Northern Ireland veteransComment: Freewheeling Boris rolls into ‘Super Thursday’, while stumbling Starmer prepares to lick his woundsLine of Duty creator puts case for the defence: ‘finale was worst episode ... but not by much’US agrees to waive intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccinesHeadteacher who broke ranks over face masks put under investigationBoris Johnson urged to resist pressure from unions over face masks in classroomThe Queen comes to Meghan’s assistance in legal battle against Mail on SundayCovid outbreak throws London G7 summit into chaosPleas for legal protection by abused men rise 50 per cent during pandemicNew blood test can detect when women will go into labourFlat-pack pasta comes to the boil in battle against global warmingComment: For those who care about free speech, Facebook\u0026#39s Trump ban should set alarm bells ringingComment: Labour faces extinction if Boris can retain his hold of the English centre Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks covid reopening has proved imperials pessimistic modelling","story":"As pandemic revisionism goes, it was really quite extraordinary.Asked on BBC Radio Four’s Today Programme about the latest data showing Britain is enjoying an eight-month low in coronavirus deaths and infections, Professor Neil Ferguson said on Tuesday: “The data is very encouraging, and very much in line with what we expected.”As it was on the radio it was impossible to tell whether this was said with a straight face, but we must assume it was. It is a wonder that nobody choked on their morning toast, for if Imperial modelling has stood for anything in this crisis, it is relentless pessimism. Plummeting figures were certainly not predicted by its researchers.The difference this time is that the Government has pressed ahead with reopening despite the doom-mongering, and so has proven the models wrong. Here is what they said would happen and what we know now:When the Government published its roadmap out of the pandemic on Feb 22, it was largely based on modelling assumptions from Imperial, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Warwick.In the end the Government chose a path somewhere between “fast” and “medium”, yet the Imperial model predicted that would still lead to Covid hospital bed occupancy of about 15,000 to 25,000 in the summer and early autumn – which was higher than the first peak in April 2020.This was in spite of a hugely successful vaccine programme which would have seen the vast majority of adults immunised by the autumn.Prof Ferguson’s team warned: “A return to higher transmissibility levels after non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted will also lead to a third wave of hospitalisations comparable in magnitude to the current wave” and called for mask wearing and hand hygiene to continue after full lifting.Under the February modelling which informed the roadmap, hospitalisations should be starting to tick up around now, but there is no evidence of that happening, with cases down 11 per cent in the past week.On Tuesday, Prof Ferguson admitted that the link between infections and deaths had now been broken, and that up to 90 per cent of people who would have ordinarily ended up in hospital after contracting Covid would no longer be admitted.“We now need to have much higher levels of infection in society in order to risk overwhelming the NHS, and we think that it’s actually unlikely to happen unless a variant comes along which resets that relationship again,” he said.“We do expect transmission and to some extent hospitalisations and deaths in late summer if we completely go back to normal, but at a much lower level that we saw back in December and January. We don\u0027t see any prospect of the NHS being overwhelmed.” The team warned there was no way out of a devastating third wave, with modellers arguing that even the slowest release in August would result in “substantial additional deaths” of around 56,900 by June 2022.A more recent update, published on March 30, reduced the central estimate to 15,700 by June next year, and suggested that England was likely to see 1,400 more coronavirus deaths between March 26 and July 5. Since March 26, England has recorded 648 more deaths, which means there would need to be roughly 12 deaths a day until the summer to hit the Imperial projections.However in the last 10 days, deaths have never risen beyond 11 in England, and were down to just one per day over the Bank Holiday weekend with just three on Tuesday – although these are likely to be artificially low and could rise again this week. In the past week, deaths have fallen by 37 per cent in Britain, and government scientists now believe Britain has reached some level of herd immunity, which is preventing transmission.In a statement released by Imperial on April 8, Prof Ferguson said: “Our modelling suggests there will be another epidemic wave as we progress through the roadmap out of lockdown.”Challenged on Tuesday by Sarah Montague about the pessimistic forecasts, Prof Ferguson admitted the initial concerns were “now diminishing”.“The data on the vaccines is getting ever more encouraging, particularly the new data that even if you do get infected if you’ve been vaccinated, you’re less infectious, and so that pushed our estimates of the scale of any potential autumn wave down.”One of the main errors in much of the modelling seems to have arisen from a misjudgement of how much schools would impact the reproduction number, or R value.In February, Imperial predicted that even with current levels of population immunity, the initial reopening of schools on March 8 would push R from 0.8 to 1.1. The team also suggested that the opening of non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality on April 12 would see R rise to 1.2. Yet the latest government estimates suggest that the R value is between 0.8 and 1.1, while other groups believe it is lower. King’s College suggests it is at 0.9.Data released on Tuesday from the ONS showed that cases in schools dropped dramatically in March, compared to last winter with just 0.33 per cent of secondary school pupils now testing positive, compared to 1.42 per cent at the peak.The ONS said that there were now so few cases in primary schools that the data could not be used to draw any statistical conclusions.Latest Test and Trace data showed that between April 15 and April 21 just 584 primary pupils tested positive from 897,734 tests – 0.06 per cent, which is far lower than the current population level of 0.18 per cent.Likewise, secondary schools recorded just 2,052 positive cases from nearly 2.5 million tests – 0.08 per cent.Read more:  Keep face masks for school pupils until at least June 21, unions demand Research by the University of Warwick, published on Feb 15, found that there was no evidence that schools were responsible for spreading Covid, with schools found to be lagging behind community infections. Several studies have now shown that parents of children are no more likely to pick up the disease than people in child-free homes.Another major problem with the Imperial modelling was that even by the end of March it had underestimated the number of people protected from coronavirus. In the updated modelling from March 30, experts said that just 44.6 per cent of the population would be protected, through vaccination or a previous infection by June 21 when the full release is scheduled to take place. However, data published by the ONS on March 30 showed that 54.7 per cent of people in England had antibodies to Covid by March 14. Wales and Northern Ireland are also around 50 per cent, and Scotland 42 per cent. Vaccine efficacy was badly underestimated, too. In the February modelling, one dose of AstraZeneca was assumed to protect between 56 and 70 per cent of people from hospitalisation and death. In reality, it was up to 94 per cent. In fact, the only thing that Imperial modelling has going for it, was it was slightly more optimistic than the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which predicted an even more devastating third wave. It makes you wonder how much more quickly we could have unlocked had the Government not had these models in mind when it published its roadmap. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"line duty creator insists viewers did fact enjoy finale","story":"The creator of Line of Duty has insisted that viewers enjoyed the finale, despite evidence to the contrary.Fans rushed to express their disappointment on Sunday night when the series drew to a downbeat close.Jed Mercurio said that “the perceived levels of dissatisfaction have been exaggerated in the echo chamber of social media”, and claimed that the BBC’s audience research was more positive.However, the research showed that the finale was the least popular episode of the series.After posting the research findings on Twitter, he was confronted by viewers who maintained that the ending had been a letdown, with lowly Det Supt Ian Buckells unmasked as the corrupt “fourth man” linked to a string of murders.In his first comments on the criticism since Sunday’s episode was broadcast, Mr Mercurio said: “No one disputes the Line of Duty finale ided social media opinion but the audience research so far shows a far less extreme picture.“We knew a ‘down’ ending would rate less favourably with some viewers, however all seven episodes varied by under 10 per cent average viewer score.” Over half of those polled rated the finale as either 910 or 1010.One thousand viewers were chosen at random and asked to rate the episodes, with their answers used to calculate an “Appreciation Index” score out of 100.Mr Mercurio said the score for the finale was “only seven points below the next lowest in season six, episode one.He added: “It’s interesting how many of the people most critical of the finale were wanting more thrills and action. This is the problem with attempting to satisfy all viewers’ expectations. It’s just not possible, I’m afraid.”When one viewer suggested that Mr Mercurio had put plausibility ahead of entertainment by letting those at the top get away with corruption, he responded: “We respect that some viewers didn’t enjoy the representation of real life as much as previous episodes and that’s indicated in the audience research. However, the research shows the majority of the audience liked the choice we made.”Another viewer pointed out that real life had not been a consideration in previous years, including a series in which Thandiwe Newton’s character murdered a colleague and had her arm amputated.Mr Mercurio said: “What can plausibly befall an inidual in drama is a very different calculation to what can plausibly happen to an institution.”The finale was watched by 12.8 million viewers, a record for the show and the highest overnight viewing figure for a drama since an episode Heartbeat drew 13.2 million in 2001.Although the show’s lead actors, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston, said last week that the story arc was at an end, the BBC is hoping to commission a seventh series.Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, called the finale “jaw-dropping” and said: “I’m looking forward to having a conversation with the team about where we go next and what the future of the series might be.”Mr Compston, who played Steve Arnott, posted a message to fans on social media in which he thanked them for their years of support.“We’ve been blown away by the reaction and love for the show. Fully understand it wasn’t the ‘urgent’ exit type ending many were hoping for but we really appreciate you sticking with us.”Mr Compston also said that he and McClure, along with Adrian Dunbar (who played Ted Hastings) had made a pact that in the “inconceivable and ridiculous” scenario that the show hit 12 million viewers, they would get matching ‘AC12million’ tattoos.He signed off: “We’ll see who is good to their word.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day duck long boi brings great joy","story":"York university student Zoe Duffin started an Instagram account for this rogue duck, over 1m tall, believed to be a cross between a Mallard and an Indian Runner duck, because, We did feel a bit sorry for him, as he didn\u0027t fit in with all the other ducks and was being shunned by them, he seemed quite lonely.

into flames after an engineer incorrectly refuelled the aircraft, a report found.  The maintenance worker who didn\u0027t speak English as his first language had added nearly 38 times too much anti bacterial chemical into the Airbus A321-211 fuel on 23 February 2020, investigators found.Three days later, the airliner was forced to make an emergency landing after one engine caught fire and the other stalled resulting in it almost crashing near Gatwick airport.The disaster may only have been averted because the 236-seat plane was flying light with no passengers and just seven crew in quiet airspace and in clear conditions.The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said that while the aircraft was being serviced at an overseas maintenance depot in Cyprus an engineer, who only spoke English as a second language, did not understand that \u0027ppm\u0027 meant \u0027parts per million’.The engineer, 52, who had never used biocide treatment before attempted to search the internet for the ‘ppm’ definition and then used an online calculator to try to figure out the correct amount, but was unable to recall which website he had used.He ended up pouring 30kgs of the anti bacterial chemical Kathon into each wing tank when he should have used 0.8kgs on each.The report found that he had also made an error by pouring the biocide directly into the tanks, so that it pooled in the bottom, rather than mixing it up with fuel and then putting it in.The plane then took off from Larnaca Airport, Cyprus to London Stansted Airport and problems with the two engines were noted over the course of its next few flights.But it wasn’t until its fourth flight when the plane took off from Gatwick airport to Stansted, that the pilot noticed that his number one engine was banging and surging at a height of 500ft.He told investigators how the Titan Airways jet was yawning...and fishtailing...all over the place as his cabin crew told him by intercom that flames were billowing out of the engine\u0027s tailpipe in the darkness.The 28-year-old pilot sent out a Mayday alert just 47 seconds after taking off and took manual control of the plane, making an emergency landing back at Gatwick at 12.20am on the 26th February, just 11 minutes after taking off.The report concluded that the excess quantity of Kathon treatment contaminated the fuel and caused the partial failure of the jet\u0027s engines due to the build up of residues.Investigators made safety recommendations, calling for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to classify the use of biocide additives as a critical maintenance task and subject to tighter rules and procedures.The report said that Airbus was also in the process of replacing the term parts per million\u0027 or ppm in its maintenance literature to the more easily understood ml1,000ltrs.Crispin Orr, Chief Inspector of Air Accidents said: This was a very serious incident that in different circumstances could have had a catastrophic outcome.He added that it was “essential that maintenance regimes are resilient to errors that could lead to fuel system contamination.”Titan Airways have been contacted for comment.More from NewsMore

rights for Covid-19 vaccines, doing its bit to help developing countries combat the virus.President Joe Biden, who had backed such a move during the 2020 presidential campaign, threw his support behind the World Trade Organisation proposal, which needed US backing.The US and several other countries had previously blocked negotiations at the WTO about the waiver proposal led by India and South Africa, which have suffered a huge toll from the coronavirus.Mr Biden\u0027s chief trade negotiator, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, said they would temporarily waive certain IP rights to help countries respond to the pandemic.“This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures, Ms Tai said in a statement.The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines.Ms Tai said the US would participate in negotiations at the WTO to ensure the waiver could happen, but cautioned it would take time. WTO decisions require a consensus of all members.Reacting to the news, Rachel Silverman, a global health expert with the Center for Global Development, said: “The Biden Administration’s support of the TRIPS waiver signals re-engagement in the number one global issue of our times: ending the COVID-19 pandemic, everywhere. “Now it’s time for the administration to lead an all-hands-on deck effort to translate this first step into real, practical impact via an enormous ramp up in funding, technology transfer, and political leadership.”Proponents, including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, say that such waivers are part of the WTO toolbox and insist there\u0027s no better time to use them than during the once-in-a-century pandemic that has taken 3.2 million lives, infected more than 437 million people and devastated economies.This is a monumental moment in the fight, Dr Ghebreyesus tweeted. The White House\u0027s support for the temporary waiving IP on #COVID19 vaccines reflects the wisdom and moral leadership the US to support #VaccineEquity and work to end this pandemic.More than 100 countries have come out in support of the proposal, and a group of 110 members of Congress - all fellow Democrats of Mr Biden - sent him a letter last month that called on him to support the waiver.The argument, part of a long-running debate about intellectual property protections, centers on lifting patents, copyrights and protections for industrial design and confidential information to help expand the production and deployment of vaccines during supply shortages. The aim is to suspend the rules for several years, just long enough to beat down the pandemic.The issue has become more pressing with a surge in cases in India, the world\u0027s second-most populous country and a key producer of vaccines - including one for Covid that relies on technology from Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer fork road labour","story":"NewsopinionKeir Starmer: We are at a fork in the road - with Labour things can be betterEXCLUSIVE: Labour’s priorities are your priorities.

As voters go to the polls today, he sets out his five-point plan to put Labour firmly on the path back to power, promising “a brighter, better future for you, your family and your community”. Writing in the Mirror, he says: “I’m driven by a burning desire to make this country the best place to grow up in and the best place to grow old in, whoever you are and wherever you live.”But he insisted that rebuilding the party after its worst general election defeat in more than  years under Jeremy Corbyn would take time.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Out on the campaign trail, he said: “We’ve got to rebuild into the next general election – that is the task at hand.” Polls suggest Labour could be hammered in the Hartlepool ­by-election as the post-Brexit sht continues and the Tories benefit from a “vaccine bounce”. A defeat there would be a blow to Mr Starmer in what is being seen as a test of Labour’s appeal to its heartlands just over a year after he pledged to rebuild the “red wall”. But one senior Labour source said: “This was always going to be tough. There is a realignment going on that can’t be stopped in a year – especially during the pandemic.” Voters will have their say on English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments as well as picking who holds power in city halls and regional mayoralties across England. It is the largest set of contests outside of a general election after last year’s polls were delayed by Covid. Boris Johnson, who campaigned on a bike on the Stourbridge canal in the West Midlands, claimed the elections would be “very tough”, despite the party being expected to make gains. Labour is expected to perform strongly in mayoral votes, including a victory for Sadiq Khan in London. “King of the North” Andy Burnham is likely to hold Greater Manchester while the party should keep ­Liverpool, Bristol and a swathe of town councils. It is also hoping to take the West of England mayoralty. Other targets are seats in ­councils across the South. But it will be tested in the West Midlands, where Labour ex-minister Liam Byrne is snapping at the heels of Tory mayor Andy Street.

The Labour Left has its knives out for Mr Starmer in the event the party suffers heavy defeats as some MPs warned he should “consider his ­position” and stand asidehe fails to make progress in “red wall” areas. But former deputy leader Harriet Harman said he should not resign no matter how badly the party fares. She said: “He’s has been trying to get the party sorted out and back on track so that we can win the confidence of British people.” The party has been closing the gap in national polls with Tory “sleaze” rows beginning to bite.  In Wales, Labour is expected to remain the biggest party but fall short of an outright majority.And in Scotland, polls suggest it is too close to call whether the SNP will get an outright majority.If they do, First Minister Nicola ­Sturgeon has said it would give a mandate for another independence referendum. Mr Johnson dismissed another vote as “irresponsible” given the pandemic.  Labour could overtake the Tories in Scotland to become the second biggest party under Anas Sarwar. On Thursday, ex-PM Gordon Brown lent his support in Glasgow. Mr Starmer – seen campaigning in Pontefract with Yvette Cooper and West Yorkshire mayoral candidate Tracy Brabin – said he will be a leader who “carries the can”.

But a study for the Compassion in Politics campaign has found huge support for making it a criminal offence for politicians to fib to the public. Some % would back the introduction of a new law to make it a crime for politicians to deliberately lie.  Support for the move was weakest among Lib Dem supporters with % giving it their approval. Backing was highest among Labour voters, % of whom wanted new legislation creating the offence, while % of Tory voters were supportive. Just three per cent of , people quizzed online by Opinium between April  and  opposed the idea – the same proportion who believed politicians routinely tell the truth. One in four polled thought no politician is ever truthful. Compassion in Politics co-director Jenner Nadel said: “We simply cannot continue to have a situation in which Parliament operates independently of every other workplace or business in the country. “If a company sells you a product and lies about it, you have the right to gain compensation. “The same should be true in politics:a politician wilfully lies about their achievements, views, or actions they should face real consequences - t hat way we can start to put some trust back in our political system and build a politics of integrity, compassion, and respect.” Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have drafted legislation making it an offence for politicians to lie, which the party plans to table in Parliament later this year. Under its proposal, which is unlikely to become law without Government support, offenders found guilty could face an unlimited fine or two-year jail terms.

The JustGiving drive asked people to help “fleeing families” make their house a home by funding new carpets and flooring. Businessman Shahid Raqib, , from Leeds, was moved by the picture and knew he had to do something to help. In an amazing act of kindness, heaposs since pledged to donate  bedroom carpets - or more,his “accountant lets him” - to children whose parents can’t afford to purchase their own.What do you think  Share your views in the comments below... Speaking to Leeds Live, Shahid, who owns SR Carpets  Floors and runs a warehouse in Bradford and carpet shops in Leeds, said: “I saw the story on social media and I thought it was appalling that children had to live like that.“The picture just got me. I’ve worked in carpets all my le, my father had a carpet shop, so it struck me there was no carpets in the bedroom. “And even though the charity was fundraising for carpets and flooring, I just thought, ‘How can I have a warehouse full of carpets when there are children sleeping nearby without any carpets ’. “No carpets means there’s also a lack of warmth and I just couldn’t justy it in my head. It didn’t feel right not to help.” He added: “I am a father myself, I have three boys, andthey couldn’t afford carpets, imagine what  they’re struggling with. “If I can help to provide carpets, at least I can help take away one burden among the many others they may have.” Shahid has since been in touch with the charity to put a plan together for how best to donate the carpets and arrange the delivery. He said: “We’re currently putting a plan in place - I want to make sure they get a choice on the carpets they get, and we need to arrange delivery and to send people down to measure and make sure we get the right sized carpets.  “I’ll also, wherever necessary, add in underlay free of charge as well. “I just want to help as many people as possible that genuinely can’t afford it.” Shahid, who has previously donated carpets to those whose homes had been flooded, continued: “I always try to give back and help where I can. “We’re not a massive company but we have a big heart. “It’s only right that we do a good deed. If we’re taking business from local customers we need to give back where we can - we can’t always listen to the accountant. “Some businesses obsess over costs and don’t always have the heart to do it. But you have to be strong and courageous in business and take financial risks. “You have a business to earn a living, but it’s so fulfilling to give back when you can.” On the JustGiving page, Zarach founder Bex Wilson explained why it was vital for the funds to be raised.

Chris King, , of Doncaster, lost both hands, except his thumbs, in an accident at work involving a metal-pressing machine. But now five years after having a pioneering operation at Leeds General Infirmarycarried out by Professor Simon Kay, he can use a pair of hand shears and his lawn mower. Talking to the Mirror about the “incredible gt” he was given in July , he said of his donor: “Because he died I’m made better and that still cuts into me now and again. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section “I still say to the Prof : ‘Do you know his nails are growing ’ and he tells me ‘Look Chris, they’re your hands’. “But he just doesn’t understand, I love it. I said to him: ‘We’re off to Scarborough. I’m taking the lad with me! He’s coming with me’. “I don’t know his family but he comes with me and it sits lovely with me.”  Chris said he doesn’t know who his donor was but believes he died in an accident and says he has written a “tear stained” thank you letter to his family. He said his donation has made him whole again and told how before his op he would hide his arms behind his back during trips out. “I always thought people were looking at me and some people were,” he said.  “But now I leave them by my side. “And then there was the time my niece just slipped her hand into mine and we just walked down to the sea together. She didn’t get scared or anything.” Chris said he has had to shield for most of the pandemic but has been kept sane because he loves “pottering around” in his garden.  “I bought myself a pair of hand shears because I can now use my hands a bit more, so I can cut my hedge in the back garden. “That’s what I used to do, I’d finish work and tidy the garden up a bit. It really boosted me up getting back to the garden. “I could still do little bits but I can pull start the mower now,too. It’s quite a lot of pressure to pull the cord, but I do that.  “I have to sometimes have a five minute rest with the shears because of the impact.” He joked: “My hands are perfect now. I can’t make a fist, butI have to defend myself, I can still give someone a severe handbagging. “And I’ve played pool and had a go at the kiddies ten pin bowling. ”  But he says the most “pleasurable” thing he’s been able to do with his new hands is to cut into a steak. “I used to go out and I’d order the steak and I’d say ‘look at that lovely meal there’ and I’d pass my meal to Mandyand say ‘Right Mandy, can you destroy it’ and she’d cut it up with a kne and fork for me. “You take your hands for granted, you really do.

We will all be affected by grief at some point – something that has proved all too true for many people as a result of the pandemic. There is of course no “right” or “normal” way to grieve – everyone will experience their own emotional journey following a bereavement. We shouldn’t be putting pressure on ourselves to experience a certain sensation – like anger or acceptance – at a certain time, says Andy Langford, clinical director at Cruse Bereavement Care. Instead, we should be giving ourselves time and space.But it can be particularly hard when you live alone. The following advice from Co-op Funeralcare might help:Keep talking One thing that can give comfort is talking about your feelings with friends or family, so it’s important not to become isolated. Stay connected Use video and phone calls and social media to stay in touch. Arrange times to chat with people – having this in your diary can add something to look forward to and purpose to your day.  Stick to a routine As much as possible, try to get up at the same time each day, and prepare and eat meals when you normally would. If you can, get outside to exercise. Don’t be too ambitious Set yourself manageable tasks. Sometimes that will simply be getting out for a walk. Getting the balance right between being busy as a distraction and taking the time to focus on your grief is key. Look after your health Maintaining healthy habits for your physical wellbeing can help with your emotional welfare. As you focus on looking after yourself and practise self-care, remember that your GP will be able to offer advice on coping with bereavement "},{"url":null,"title":"jesy brave walk away little","story":"NewsopinionJesy Nelson is so brave to walk away from Little MixThe Little Mix star announced she was leaving the chart-topping band last December and now shes revealed the reason why...mirrorShareCommentsByEva Simpson:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionJesy walked away from pop dream \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The reasons could often be described as trivial. A spat over a jacket , a smashed-up guitar . But there’s nothing trivial about singer Jesy Nelson’s decision to quit Little Mix. The star announced she was leaving the chart-topping band last December. When she pulled out of their BBC talent show The Search citing medical reasons I knew the writing was on the wall. This week she announced the reason for her decision. In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine she revealed her departure was due to her struggles with weight. Like many of us, she says she’d gained weight during lockdown. She then went on an extreme diet to get in shape for a music video. It left her thoroughly miserable and on the day of the shoot she had a panic attack. Thankfully, someone took her aside and basically said what she was going through – the dieting, trying to change her body shape and being left unhappy and in tears – simply wasn’t worth it. It was a turning point and with courage she walked away. I really applaud her for taking that step and I applaud the person who told her “you can’t keep doing this to yourself”. When I covered showbiz, it was unusual for people in the music industry to put the wellbeing and feelings of the artist first. Too often people stay in unhappy situations, be it their professional or personal lives, for all the wrong reasons. I know I certainly have.

Former actress Meghan, , sued Associated Newspapers Limited , the publisher of the Mail On Sunday and MailOnline, over a series of articles which reproduced parts of a handwritten letter sent to Thomas Markle, , in August . She claimed the five articles, published in print and online in February , misused her private information, infringed herand breached the Data Protection Act. In February, the High Court granted Meghan summary judgment in relation to her privacy claim, meaning she won that part of the case without having to go to trial, as well as most of herclaim.  At a remote hearing on Wednesday, Lord Justice Warby granted summary judgment in relation to the remaining parts of the duchessaposclaim, after lawyers acting on behalf of the Queen said it does not belong to the Crown. ANL previously said it believed Jason Knauf - formerly communications secretary to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - was a co-author of the letter, after Meghan discussed the content of the letter with him before sending it. The newspaper group argued this meant the letter belonged to the Crown.  But today, the High Court heard that Mr Knauf has emphatically denied being a co-author and that lawyers representing the Keeper of the Privy Purse, acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen told Meghanaposs solicitors they did not consider the Crown to be theowner. In March, the publisher was ordered to print a statement on the front page of the Mail On Sunday and a notice on page three of the paper stating it infringed herby publishing parts of the letter to Mr Markle.

The Duchess of Sussex yesterday announced she has written a childrenaposs book about the relationship between a dad and a son which will be published next month. The book, titled aposThe Benchapos, features an illustration of a soldier, with ginger hair, who holds his little boy. Royal author Phil Dampier has claimed that with her new book Meghan wants to show that her husband is upset after losing his military titles - which were removed after the Sussexes stepped down as senior members of the Royal Family.  Mr Dampier told The Sun : Meghan is probably showing how much the Army meant to Harry and how upset he is to lose his military titles.For Harry, who put his le on the line and then founded the highly successful Invictus Games for injured servicemen and women, losing the titles was the bitterest part of ‘Megxit.’ Meghanaposs book focuses on the special relationship between a dad and a son as seen through the mumaposs eyes, publisher Random House said on Tuesday.  The Bench started as a poem I wrote for my husband on Fatheraposs Day, the month after Archie was born,aposapos Meghan said in a statement. That poem became this story. Meghan said: My hope is that The Bench resonates with every family, no matter the makeup, as much as it does with mine.”  The bookaposs cover features her royal title, the Duchess of Sussex. The picture book, published by Random House Childrenaposs Books, has been illustrated by award winning artist Christian Robinson, and the audiobook is narrated by Meghan. A press release describes the book as a “touchingly captures the evolving and expanding relationship between fathers and sons and reminds us of the many ways that love can take shape and be expressed in a modern family”.

Landlord Jonathan Armstrong claimed he had no choice but to take action, after the rude and obnoxious behaviour of younger drinkers. They were putting regular customers off by flouting social distancing rules at the Old Neighbourhood drinking venue since it’s reopening, Mr Armstrong explained, causing people in the local area to stop visiting. The pub, based in Chalford Hill, Stroud, was among those with beer gardens allowed to reopen and let customers drink outside after lockdown restrictions were eased. But Mr Armstrong said it had been an uphill battle from then on, trying to stop younger drinkers from table-hopping, ignoring social distancing rules and annoying neighbours. Regular customers had also stopped visiting the pub because they felt intimidated by the bad language, shouting and loud behaviour from customers under . Staff were constantly having to tell them to sit down, to stop hopping tables and to follow the guidelines,” he said. “You have to fight them about it and then they just start getting rude and obnoxious. We constantly have to apologise to neighbours because theyaposre making such a noise. Itaposs just not what we are about. Itaposs a shame, it really is. Weaposre really upset about it because itaposs something weaposre not used to and I think itaposs unnecessary.  He has even employed a doorman to try to help keep order at the pub. Itaposs unfortunate because there are youngsters who are really well behaved and I hate painting people with the same brush. With people under the age of  taking up all of the  outside seats on some evenings, Mr Armstrong said he thought the bad behaviour might have been caused by lockdown and fewer pubs in general being open. I think whataposs happened is that a lot of the pubs have closed because they havenapost got outside gardens, so anyone with a garden is attracting all these other people. I often wonderitaposs maybe because theyaposve come of age during lockdown and they havenapost been to a pub before. Iaposm not sure, they just donapost seem to know how to behave.

Halima Cisse, , from Mali, captured the attention of the West African nation when she delivered her nine babies via C-section on Tuesday. Doctors originally thought she would give birth to seven babies after she had an ultrasound- but missed two of them in a scan. Halima, flown in to Morocco for specialist care, went on to give birth to five girl and four boys - with doctors saying all children and mum are doing well. Footage taken shortly after the birth shows a team of medics dealing with the babies as they are swaddled and checked over. Should all nine babies survive, the birth would break the current world record set by aposOctomumapos Nadya Suleman in , who gave birth to eight babies that survived. Nonuplets are extremely rare and medical complications associated with multiple births often mean that some of the babies do not reach full term. Halima spent two weeks in Point G Hospital in the Malian capital of Bamako before she was transferred to Morocco after the intervention of Maliaposs President of Transition Bah NaposDaw. She was admitted to the Moroccan clinic on March  and finally gave birth on Tuesday. It is currently unclearher pregnancy was due to In vitro fertilizationtreatment, which is one of the more common causes of multiple births, how much the babies weigh, or how far along she was in her pregnancy. The first recorded set of nonuplets was in Sydney in the , with two stillborn and none of the babies survived more than a week. Similarly in another case in Malaysia, in , all nine of the babies died shortly after birth. The nonuplet news comes after a woman who didnapost know she was pregnant gave birth on board an airplane. It was not the kind of arrival Lavinia Mounga was expecting as she flew from Salt Lake City in the US to Honolulu.

Locals were left baffled, with some people questioning whether the relief money should have been used in a dferent way. The town, where flying squid is a typical local dish, reportedly used  million yen - the equivalent of about £, - out of a total of  million yenof emergency funding received by the central government to build the statue. Total construction costs were around  million yen , domestic media reported. It comes as Japan battles another surge in coronavirus cases and, although the city has had few infections, it has been impacted by a drop in visitors. The giant squid statue is said to be part of a programme by the local government to boost the number of tourists amid the pandemic, according to local media. It is believed construction of the pink cephalopod began in October  and the finished statue was moved to its current home in March of this year.

The former Dunfermline and Raith Rovers talisman has scored four goals in his last seven club games and was selected in Clarke’s last squad to face Austria, Israel and Faroe Islands last month.He made his international debut, coming on as a th-minute substitute in a - triumph over the Faroes.The news of his omission in favour of Nisbet would have undoubtedly landed like a tonne of bricks on Shankland, who had become a well-kent face in the Scotland set-up.He has only made four appearances, but has been a steady pick since his maiden call-up in October  always relied upon to graft, press and, when needed, convert a crucial penalty, as he did in last year’s Euro  playoff semi-final win over Israel.However, Shankland has only scored eight times this seasoncompared to Nisbet’s tally of . If it comes down to a straight shoot-out, there will only be one winner.The question is: will it  Or will Clarke take into account the areas in which Shankland has continued to thrive, even as the goals dried up.So often seen as a one-dimensional goal-getter in his youth, Shankland’s game has undoubtedly developed during United’s campaign in the top-flight. He has illustrated versatility and a fine work ethic in Micky Mellon’s demanding --.‘Defend from the front,’ is the oft-repeated mantra and heat maps from Shankland#s last six starts in the Premiership — provided by Opta Sports — underline his willingness to work across the midfield line and defend deep on the flanks.Nisbet, by contrast, is afforded the chance to do the majority of his work in central areas. The -year-old will occasionally drop deep to collect possession, hold the ball up and find a teammate, but will then dash for the box.His movements into wide areas are sparse and rarely go beyond a foray to the left channel. However, the wing is the domain of the excellent Josh Doig.The vast dference in amount of time both players actually spend in central areas due to the dferent shapes and priorities of United and Hibs make it unfair to compare the players solely on goals.If Clarke is looking for a player to throw on in desperate search of a late goal a predatory front-man whose instincts have been sharpened following a season of playing as an out-and-out ’No.’, then Nisbet is the safer bet.If he intends to select a player who has proved adept at contributing to the game, whether in or out of possession, then Shankland is back in the game — as statistics from both players’ last  Premiership starts illustrate.Shankland may not ripple the net with the same regularity as Nisbet, but he affects the game more, has more touches, makes more passes and creates chances for others at a higher rate.UEFA’s decision to allow national teams to select three extra bodies —  instead of the usual  — has created a fascinating new dynamic, as has the unfortunate injury to Oli McBurnie.Ché Adams, of course, is a certainty.Is Leigh Grfiths a wildcard that Clarke will be tempted to include And, depending on where he lands on his other attacking dilemmas, will he go for the arch goal-getter, Nisbet, or the versatile grafter, Shankland.One suspects Clarke’s mind is not quite made up — and a standout performance at Hampden on Saturday could quite literally be a game-changer for either man.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

Using this information and this week#s reporting, we answer some of the most frequently-asked questions about the scheme. Aberdeenshire Council wants to introduce a third bin to its kerbside collection routine. Currently it collects landfill waste and mixed recycling on alternate weeks, with food waste picked up every week.The proposed three-weekly cycle would change this to:In the new system the general waste bin will be used for non-paper recyclables, with contents of the third, smaller bins destined for landfill. The council wants people to recycle more of their household waste, rather than sending it to landfill.In  it studied , residents’ general waste bins and found more than half the items inside could have been recycled instead. This amounts to , tonnes of material every year – at an annual cost of £. million. The types of items currently collected won’t change – just the bins they are placed in.Residents will still be able to recycle plastics , metals , paper, card, cardboard and cartons. The plans are currently subject to funding from Zero Waste Scotland, which has a £m fund to help councils improve recycling rates. If the application is approved, the changes will be rolled out in stages across the region with households notied ahead of time by post. The council says , new bins will be required to cover every household in Aberdeenshire, at a cost of around £.m. In , Zero Waste Scotland conducted an in-depth investigation into the potential health impact of reducing bin collections.It found that, as long as residents bagged up their waste rather than leaving it loose, and councils picked up food waste separately and regularly, there would be few issues. Aberdeenshire Council found more than % the contents of residents’ landfill bins could be recycled instead – so using the new system should prevent any overflows.A survey in  showed the majority of residents use less than three-quarters of their general waste bins between collections, with almost one-third filling it less than halfway.The local authority has procedures in place for households to apply for more bins,required, as well as a network of recycling centres.The council says businesses and householders fly-tip already and, during previous changes to bin collections, any increases tend to be short-lived.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/IMG_1841.jpg ","title":"aberdeen special education school takes part in light the norths little lights programme","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remPupils at an Aberdeen school have decorated a lighthouse for the Light The North sculpture trail.Orchard Brae School was involved in the education initiative which was created to give young people across the north-east, Moray, Orkney and Shetland the opportunity to get creative and help their school or group design a little lighthouse to be featured on the trail.Shining a light across the north of Scotland, Light the North will see  .-metre-tall lighthouses designed by UK artists set up and on display for  weeks from Monday, August .Orchard Brae School#s art teacher Diane Jack said she really wanted the schoolchildren to take part in the project.It is one of  schools and groups taking part in the education programme running alongside CLAN#s trail.She said: #The Little Light project is a very nice thing to be involved in and it#s for a great cause.#Our pupils have severe and complex needs # it ranges from complex autism to cerebral palsy and ious other conditions which require the children to have a lot of extra support.#Since Orchard Brae School, on Howes Road, champions inclusivity, Diane wanted to find a way to make sure all the school#s  pupils could take part in the creative project.She said: #Because of the nature of our school and children, I wanted to make sure that every single child got to make a contribution.#I did a bit of thinking and came up with a design that I thought could work.#Every child painted a piece of paper # each class got a colour # and they painted that piece of paper with oil pastels and paint.#I cut out the hearts and glued on the hearts onto the lighthouse and then it was nished.#It was very important to me that everyone had a chance to contribute to it.#We have a strong ethos of inclusion # we try very hard to adapt everything so everyone can be included.#Orchard Brae at Ashgrove, which is based within the Ashgrove Children’s Centre and is Orchard Brae School#s nursery facility, also took part in the Little Lights project.Diane, who previously worked as a nursery teacher at the facility, said: #I sent materials to them and they sent back the children#s work, which we then had to quarantine.#I think all the kids enjoyed being part of the project.#Orchard Brae School#s little lighthouse will be shown at Aberdeen Science Centre later this year before being ed to the school once the trail is completed in October.Diane said: #Our children are aged between three and  and I hope this is something they#ll all be able to do with their families or carers # to go see their own lighthouse or some other ones, too.#Fiona Fernie, CLAN#s head of income generation and business development, said the cancer support charity was #delighted# to offer schools and youth groups the opportunity to get involved.She said: #Not only will they get to design and keep their own little lighthouse, but the Little Lights education programme also provides participating schools with a creative learning resource, which teaches them about the history of lighthouses, the region’s strong links to the sea, and cancer and mental wellbeing.#Every school community is affected by cancer in some way and we want to support people to give them the tools to approach this dficult subject.#Talking and learning about cancer is a clear way to help a school community remain a supportive, understanding and open environment for both staff and students.#CLAN’s event partner, Wild in Art, is excited about the prospect of exhibiting young people’s artistic talent through their little lighthouses.Charlie Langhorne, Wild in Art co-founder and managing director, said: #As well as raising funds for CLAN, Light the North also offers a simple way to encourage conversations about cancer, mental and physical wellbeing. All while making memories that can be cherished for years to come.#The Education Programme provides schools and groups with a creative project that helps explore these topics and highlights the support that’s available.#The little lighthouse sculptures give children and young people an opportunity to showcase their creativity on a high-profile sculpture trail and raise awareness of the issues that are important to them.#At the end of this year’s trail, which will be present in each of the areas that CLAN Cancer Support operates, all lighthouse sculptures # excluding the ones created by schoolchildren # will be auctioned off to raise funds for the charity so that it can continue supporting people affected by cancer.CLAN’s Light The North Farewell Weekend will take place from

“ability” of MSPs who accuse her of ignoring the north-east in favour of the central belt.Several Conservative candidates – including the party’s leader Douglas Ross – have claimed the First Minister and her party have consistently overlooked the region in favour of other parts of the country.Similar claims were also made by Aberdeen City Council’s leaders after the Granite City was placed in a local lockdown last year due to a surge in Covid- cases.However, on a visit to Aberdeenshire West – one of Scotland’s most hotly-contested seats, with a Conservative majority of just  – Ms Sturgeon said she would “challenge and counter” the claim.Although she said she would listen to those who feel their areas deserve more, the First Minister also said her opponents should do more to represent their constituencies in parliament.She said: “What I would say to the Tory MSPs who make that claim is thatthe areas they represent are being ignored, what does that say about them and their ability to make sure the constituencies they represent are being listened to “This constituency will not be in any way ignoredFergus Mutch is the MSP because he won’t let it be, and I am pretty confident about that.”Ms Sturgeon was visiting Alford on the last day of campaigning ahead of Thursday’s vote, and revealed she is “quietly optimistic” the SNP can overturn Alexander Burnett’s  majority in the seat.The First Minister said the party would draw on the experience of the  general election, where Mr Mutch reduced Andrew Bowie’s lead in West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine from around , to just over .“We don’t take it for granted in any sense but we are quietly optimistic,” Mr Sturgeon said.“Fergus is a fantastic candidate and would be an outstanding MSP for this constituency, and he has been working incredibly hard for every single vote.“I think the combination of the SNP’s good position in the polls and Fergus’s strong local commitment and effort puts us in a good position, but people have to come out and vote for itthey want to see the result we are hoping to record.“We take huge heart from [the general election]. The  election result was probably better than we had expected it to be although I know Fergus was working hard – I visited him in the latter stages of that campaign as well.“It gives us enormous confidence that the SNP has the momentum here and is building the trust and confidence of people, and Fergus I think has really established himself on a whole range of local issues as someone who would stand up and be counted for this constituency.“All of these things point in a positive direction but until the votes are in the ballot boxes you can’t take anything for granted, and I know Fergus will be working right up until pm on Thursday night.”Mr Bowie, who has been the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine since , accused the First Minister of “box-ticking” following her second visit to the north-east in as many weeks.“Their candidates have been anonymous up to this point,” he said.“And it begs the question where the SNP have been for the last  years when north-east public services were being cut from Holyrood.“Alexander and Douglas have been champions for their areas for years, speaking up for communities in Alford, Aberdeen and across the north-east.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"intimidating dogs drive posties out of aberdeen high rise as royal mail halts deliveries","story":"More than  homes in an Aberdeen high-rise have been declared a no-go zone by Royal Mail after posties said they were scared of intimidating dogs in the building.

However, what has happened is the unionist vote has increased, and they have become synonymous with the defence of the union.“It is good politics for them to keep the issue live, and you see Douglas Ross talking about it more than the SNP do. The Conservatives benefit from that.”Mr Harvey believes new Labour leader Anas Sarwar has had some success by putting his party above the independence debate.However, the politics professor does not expect that to be enough for Scottish Labour to make signicant gains in the north-east.“The interesting thing about this election is the strategy Labour have taken, and in particular Anas Sarwar, because he is a new kind of Labour leader,” Mr Harvey said.“He has tried to get Labour not to take a position on a referendum. People know they are a unionist party and don’t want a referendum in the coming years, but what he has tried to do is position them as being above the fray, and he’s done that with some success.“His position is Labour are the only party that cares about the other issues, and it’s really interesting to see they have got some traction by doing that.“I am interested to see how successful that is as a strategy for Labour. However, the constitution is the only game in town.“When you ask the public what they see as the key issue the constitutional question tends to be up there. It’s almost always in the top three along with health and education.“It usually goes down constitutional lines. If you are pro-independence and pro-referendum you vote for the SNP, andyou are not you vote for the unionist parties. There are parallels with the US in terms of how ided society is.“I don’t see that going away any time soon.”Mr Harvey does not expect major changes in the constituencies, although the professor believes the #kne-edge# seat of Aberdeenshire West could fall to the SNP, who have a majority of just  to overturn to take it from the Conservatives.Butthere is to be a surprise, he thinks it could come in Banffshire and Buchan Coast, where Stewart Stevenson is standing down after more than  years in the job.“Even though it had a five-figure majority last time, Banffshire and Buchan Coast is one that doesn’t behave like other constituencies in the north-east,” Mr Harvey said.“It is much more like Moray – there are a lot of farmers and fishermen, and much of the territory is in the Moray Council area.“That would be the constituency to keep an eye on, especially because Stewart Stevenson is standing down. Karen Adam will have a little bit of name recognition, having been a councillor, but Stewart had  years’ worth of being an MSP behind him.“I don’t expect it to switch though.“Aberdeenshire West is the only one where there is realistic potential for a change. It is on a kne-edge, and at the moment I would probably lean towards the SNP taking it.”The race for list seats in the north-east is also set to be key on polling day.In , Tory candidates took four of the additional seats, Labour two and the Liberal Democrats one.But Mr Harvey believes the Greens could pick up a seat, with polls showing they could be on track for around %.Alex Salmond’s Alba party are also targeting the regional list – but despite their aim to build a pro-independence “supermajority”, the professor said it is actually in their interests for the Conservatives to hold Aberdeenshire West.“The dficulty for Alba is they need to get about % of the vote, which means somewhere between , and , votes,” he added.“It’s doable but it depends on whether the SNP win Aberdeenshire West. That would make it harder for Alba because the Conservatives would then have three list seats.“The list vote looks like it’s going to be fairly consistent with , with the only dference possibly being the Greens might well take a seat. If they keep their vote share up they would be on about % which would probably get them a seat.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/2.58852423-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"long read should scotlands primary school starting age be raised to seven","story":"At the age of four or five children in Scotland take their first footsteps into the classroom, but there is debate about whether that should be delayed.

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Hopefully with all of that we see light at the end of the tunnel for fans getting back next season.”On the encouraging start to season ticket sales the chairman added: “The response has been fantastic. After a few days as of last night we had sold , season tickets already and .% of those are new season ticket holders which is important as well as we drive forward with the aspiration of getting , season ticket holders.“If you help us get to , season tickets this year each season ticket holder will get five percent cashback to spend at the club. If we get , each season ticket holder will get % so it’s not to be snfed at.“I believe it is doable with the fan engagement Rob and the guys are putting in place and we have a strategy on the field for playing attacking and entertaining football.“We want to reward fans who cajole a family member or friend into giving us a chance to entertain them.” While Wicks oversees improvements off the field at Pittodrie Cormack is focused with manager Stephen Glass on bringing improvements on the pitch and expects to be busy supporting the new boss’ recruitment efforts in the weeks ahead.He said: “After bringing in Stephen Glass and Allan Russell # and with Scott Brown to join them – it was important we give them a period of time with the existing squad. They’ve only had a short period of time with the guys“We outlined a clear strategy for the club. How we greet fans here, how the food is considered is important. But on the field that attacking entertaining style of play is important. When I look back on my time when Aberdeen have been successful it has been down to a combination of an entertaining style of play, experienced professionals and young players coming through.“In the last few weeks Paul Sheerin and Stephen have given young players full debuts, not a cameo at the end of the game. That in itself is encouraging.“There are a number of players out of contract and Stephen will wait until these last two games. We’ve also talked about potential targets and you will see some announcements that Stephen and his team will make on players coming in for next season.“It’s an exciting time and everybody can’t wait to get back and experience the club. I’m realistic but optimistic about next season. This is not like a few years ago. Next season is going to be the most competitive in some time which is healthy for the league but also we need to be ready for that and I think we will be.”Cormack and Wicks also confirmed the club’s new kits for next season will be unveiled later than normal. The home kit should be launched next month or early July with the away kit following in August.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 9 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are also looking for volunteers to support the service.There are an estimated , armed forces veterans in Scotland, with an average age of .  The Comradeship Circles also welcome their partners, widows, and widowers.Participants simply dial into the weekly chat, with a facilitator on hand to assistnecessary. The service is popular with those who are unable or find it dficult to enjoy social connection online.Our Comradeship Circles has been a social leline for many over the last six months, so we’re delighted this funding means they can continue. Even before the pandemic, thousands of older veterans still felt isolated because of health conditions, disabilities, or living in a rural location. Although restrictions are now easing, we know that many are feeling lonelier than ever before.While more and more older people are getting online, there are still hundreds of thousands who are unable or prefer not to use the internet. This telephone service has been especially valued by older veterans who have a disability or health condition which means they struggle to use the video conferencing apps.Comradeship Circles mean they can enjoy banter and share stories and memories of military le.

It was not the practice to make public the particulars in cases where those responsible for criminal investigation were satisfied that no crime had been committed but he might mention, for the satisfaction of the honourable member and those on whose behalf the question was put, that on recovery of the body what was observed tended strongly to confirm the accuracy of the statements which had been made at the time by those who were with the deceased when the accident took place.#PICS:Alexander McNab, born Argyll in , at two stages in le. no_aMcNab_story_AlexClare#s great grandmother, Grace McNab Bridge, as a young woman in the early th century. no_aMcNab_story_GraceGrace in later years. no_aMcNab_story_GraceClare Frith has been researching her family history. no_aMcNab_story_ClarePrivate Andrew McNab, one of three McNab brothers killed during the First World War. no_aMcNab_story_Andrew"},{"url":null,"title":"shorter racing only scottish series planned","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Each route takes visitors on a real pilgrimage to ancient Christian landmarks, through remote and impressive landscapes.#Whilst Faith in Cowal is a Christian organisation, the routes are open to people of all faiths and none and provide the perfect way to connect with the wild beauty Cowal has to offer. Some of the sites that book-end each trail date as far back as the th and th centuries as well as more ancient landmarks such as Auchnaha Cairn that are thought to be Neolithic in origin.#The walks take in locations close to the major settlements and population centres of Cowal including Strachur, Dunoon, Kilfinan and Colintraive but they#re unlike any other path you#ll find. These are not all neatly manicured and waymarked trails. We have deliberately kept them dynamic and wild by making use of forestry roads and ancient heritage paths. Many of the routes require short, improvised hikes between paths so you#ll feel like a real pilgrim forging your way through the landscape.#There are detailed guides on our website as well as downloadable GPS tracks. We hope as many visitors to Cowal as possible will take this opportunity to step in the footsteps of ancient pilgrims and travellers, enjoy the wonderful scenery of Argyll and explore fascinating sites of genuine spiritual and religious importance,# added Dan.PICS:A map of the routes. no_aFootstepsFaithPhotos: subtlesensorHistoric Kilmun church, on the shores of the Holy Loch. no_aFootstepsFaith_©subtlesensor_Kilmorich graveyard, Cairndow. no_aFootstepsFaith_KilmorichGraveyard©subtlesensor"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Thursday night is shinty night in Lochgilphead, with the club holding primary school age coaching from pm to pm and combined men#s and women#s training from pm to .pm.The practicalities of travelling to away matches under Covid rules do, however, give cause for concern. #We can#t use a minibus as things stand and will have to use inidual cars for a -strong squad,# said Angus.#With seven players under  years of age in the squad, we will have to rely on the support of parents.#Kilmory has been placed in the Mowi South A regional league alongside Bute, Lochside, Taynuilt, Ballachulish and Inveraray second team.#There is tough competition in the league,# said Angus, #so with the number of young players we have it will be a case of getting the best team we can on the pitch every week, learning against good opposition and building for the future.#Inveraray#s first team will compete in Mowi Senior League C with Aberdour, Glasgow Mid Argyll, Kyles Athletic, Oban Camanachd and Oban Celtic.Inveraray players were non-contact training twice a week as soon as the rules allowed and club chairman Andrew McMurdo is pleased with their attitude. #I didn#t know what to expect, but the boys have been great and conscientious about the way they go about it. And socially it#s been good for them,# he said.#Both first and second teams are in challenging leagues, but it#s a good challenge. And with no relegation, we can experiment a bit and plan for next season.#Like every other aspect of le, shinty has had to be flexible and adapt to the pandemic, so hats off to the Camanachd Association for having the plans in place and implementing them so quickly.#New volunteers at Kilmory and Inveraray shinty clubs would also be welcome, particularly with the additional burden of meeting Covid requirements.Andrew McMurdo said: #No matter how big or small the task, more hands lighten the load, so we would appreciate the help of new volunteers.#PICS:Inveraray’s Andrew Fraser in yellow and black during a friendly match with Glasgow Mid Argyll in February  # one of the last matches before lockdown.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mountain bikingHire a mountain bike at one of Scotlandrsquos many trail centres and ride routes that are graded green for beginners, through blue, red and black for the most experienced. There are also orange grades for the most technical downhill sections.Visit trail centres such as Glentress near Peebles Laggan Wolftrax near Newtonmore and Comrie Croft in Perthshire, where there are routes for all ages and aspirations.. Canadian canoeingThere are numerous rivers and lochs in Scotland that are ideal for a two-person paddle in an open-top Canadian canoe.To start with, choose a calm day and a waterway that is not choppy.

I have served as the MSP for the constituency since , following a by-election, gaining . per cent of the vote and a , majority.At every turn, I have stood up and fought for my constituents. Most notably, throughout the pandemic, I have been supporting constituents and businesses with COVID- related matters such as sourcing financial help and dealing with concerns over vaccinations.I have delivered real results for the Borders. I campaigned for the poundm Borderlands funding for a Bordersrsquo Railway extension feasibility study, supported the successful re-instatement of Reston station and called for a fund to fix the crumbling roads. On the rural front, I put pressure on the SNP Government for more funding for agriculture and pushed for more resources to tackle rural crime and fly-tipping.As the Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Social Security and Older People, I worked with the Scottish Conservative strategy team, to formulate new policies to support older people and matters relating to Social Security Portfolio, such as narrowing the disability employment gap and improving digital inclusion.Looking ahead to the election I will campaign hard for local issues. When it comes to our fantastic NHS, I want a focus on reducing waiting times, improving mental health services and protecting local GP surgeries.As we emerge from the COVID pandemic, we must attract high quality, well-paid jobs to the Borders and improve infrastructure and digital connectivity to bolster the rural economy.On education, I support a national tutoring programme to help pupils catch up, more rural teachers and free school breakfasts and lunches to all primary school children.My campaign, alongside Doddie Weir OBE, continues on automatic access for people living with MND to receive a Blue Badge. Moreover, I have urged the Scottish Government to provide free dyslexia tests for adults to improve social mobility  opportunities.I continue to strongly oppose a second independence referendum and believe we can build back better with the strength of the United Kingdom.Barbra Harvie Barbra Harvie, Scottish GreensThe Scottish Green Party candidate for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, Barbra Harvie, is a semi-retired lecturer in Ecology, Environment and Countryside who lives in Selkirk.She says: \"Our isolated rural communities and small urban environments in South of Scotland have come together with resilience, determination and care to tackle the enormous challenge of COVID- but we are also facing a global climate emergency that can no longer be ignored.\"Scotland needs a Green recovery from the global pandemic that also confronts the global climate emergency.

Before politics I worked in the third sector as a fundraising assistant for Marie Curie, and then for international oil company National Oilwell Varco Mission Products handling customs and logistics. I now work part time as Office Manager for a member of the Scottish Parliament and as a Communications Manager for an MP. I decided to stand in the General Election in  in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk because I was tired of the constitutional wrangling and wanted to bring the focus back to making a dference locally and further afield. Now, we need to put recovery from the pandemic first. From supporting tourism and local business to tackling the climate emergency, delivering a better education system, supporting the NHS, bettering mental health provision, and making the case for a truly federal UK, I will always stand up for the disadvantaged and will make fairness and tackling inequality central to everything I want to achieve. I want to remove the barriers to opportunity which face rural areas more than others. Everyone should have the chance of living the le they want and to be as successful as possible. During the last year the curtains have been pulled back on where the help is most needed and we need to have a needle sharp focus on getting help to all those in that position. Ultimately, I want to tackle to the root of inequality which is poverty, and keep the climate crisis at the top of everyonersquos agenda. We know our country is wracked by constitutional ision and inequality so now our representatives need to focus on healing and serving communities to the best of their ability at a time when it has never mattered more.

He was educated in Edinburgh before studying for his honours degree in Economics at University of Aberdeen, before embarking on a -year career as a professional economist. In , Paul graduated with a Masters in Business Administrationfrom University of Edinburgh. A keen rugby player at school, Paul is a fan of both rugby and football, and has a keen interest in local history and genealogy. Paul has one son.Paul has served as a South Scotland MSP since . In the last five years alone, Paul and his team have helped or supported more than , constituents from his office in Hawick. Paul is an experienced parliamentarian and minister, having led seven Acts through Parliament ndash most recently legislating on Heat networks. Indeed, after serving for a year on the Parliamentrsquos Finance Committee and Standards Committee, Paul was appointed within the Scottish Government in , as Minister for Environment and Climate Change, in which role he served until November . In Nicola Sturgeonrsquos first ministerial team following her appointment, Paul was appointed Minister for Community Safety and Legal Affairs and, following, the  election, became Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy. In June , Paulrsquos portfolio was modied retaining Energy and taking over digital infrastructure investment in broadband and mobile, as well as the Islands portfolio, as Minister for Energy, Connectivity  the Islands. Since , he has led the Scottish Governmentrsquos Energy Strategy and the transition of Scotlandrsquos energy system, delivering the equivalent of some  per cent of Scotlandrsquos electricity demand in  from renewable electricity sources.

Indeed, I spent years at an Edinburgh healthcare technology company, collaborating with universities and NHS Scotland on articial intelligence software for cancer screening and diagnosis of stroke.Throughout this pandemic we have seen the power of our countryrsquos science base. Despite bumps in the road, the roll-out of testing and multiple vaccines has been impressive.But the pandemic tells another story too ndash of warnings ignored and preparations left unmade. We could and should have had a better plan for one of the highest-ranked known public health risks. We must learn from this collective failure.Scientists have warned for decades that the world is heading towards climate breakdown. They also now speak of a ldquonature emergency ndash an era of mass extinctions caused by humans. Yet greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere relentlessly rise and our forests and oceans continue in dangerous decline. Nowadays, I see scientists practically weeping as they watch this unravelling accelerate, with no believable action plan from politicians.The Scottish Greens recognise that technology will play a huge part in stepping us back from the brink. Our co-leader Lorna Slater is a renewable energy engineer, and our proposed poundbn Green Recovery investment programme will fund thousands of high-quality, unionised Scottish jobs in renewables. But letrsquos not kid ourselves. Itrsquos mostly not technology we lack, itrsquos political will.The Greens will invest massively in warm homes ndash upgrading insulation and converting to low-carbon heating systems. We have bold plans to improve rail, bus and active travel, and already won free bus travel for under-s from this summer. Finally, we propose an urgent programme to repair nature, dramatically accelerating the positive steps already taken by rural businesses, workers and charities.These solutions are not high-tech, not ldquosexy and may not generate huge profits for international investors and a rich elite. But theyrsquore effective, labour-intensive, local, and fair.This election is our chance to tackle the climate emergency, to build a green recovery, and to secure our future as an independent European country. Please vote like our future depends on it. Vote Scottish Greens.Michael Banks Michael Banks is a retired barrister and Vanguard Partys candidate for Midlothian South, Tweeddale  Lauderdale, and heads the partys list for South Scotland. He has lived in the Scottish Borders for  years.Vanguard Party champions the Union and Brexit. The UK, four nations in union, will prosper as an independent country, outwith the EU. If Scotland were to leave the Union and join the EU, it would not be an independent country. It would be a rule-taker from Brussels. There would be a hard border with the rest of the UK. Scottish exports to the rest of the UK are currently worth three times those to the EU. Funding via the Barnett formula would end. Scots would lose British citizenship.Vanguard Party believes Scotlands future should be decided by the people, not the courts. However, independence is not practical without the support of a simple majorityof the registered electorate, not merely a simple majority of valid votes. IndyRef must require a simple majority of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland, for the whole of Scotland to leave. In  only  per cent of the registered electorate of the whole of Scotland voted for independence.Vanguard Party will preserve the distinction between sex and gender. It will protect womens rights to same-sex spaces. It will oppose self-identication.

Most important was keeping in touch with you through my surgeries: in supermarkets, libraries, and my annual summer surgery tour through the villages. This past year of course has changed everything. We have all been stuck at home keeping in touch through emails. COVID has dominated and I have tried to help you with the problems it brought in its wake. Moving now through vaccination, queries arise as you await that appointment. At the same time other issues continue: unsuitable housing, planning concerns. This is the essential work and duty of an MSP to constituents no matter what their politics. I hope I have discharged that duty. I have also chaired the parliamentrsquos cross-party group on animal welfare for many years with two Bills to my name: The Control of DogsAct , now law, putting the blame on the owner not the dog and The Welfare of DogsBill which aims to end casual purchase of puppies. COVID prevented it proceeding butelected I intend to bring it back, especially with concern that some of those \"COVID\" puppies will end up in animal rescue centres. Yes, how le has changed, COVID has been hard: losing a business built over years, living with children trapped in a flat, not attending a funeral, delaying the wedding, the new baby not socialising with family. The list is endless of the sacrices, the losses. COVID has broken the link with the way we were, just as those World Wars changed society. Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated true leadership and moving to recovery it must not be back to the same old, same old but to a socially just society, valuing people from cradle to grave, our public services, rejoining the EU as an independent nation. On May , I ask for your constituency vote on my record as your MSP and the list vote for the SNP, giving you and Scotland a democratic choice to move forward as a renewed nation.Shona Haslam Shona Haslam, Scottish ConservativesOn Thursday, May , voters are faced with a choice. Rebuild our communities after the pandemic by improving our childrenrsquos education, delivering record funding to our NHS and enhancing employment opportunities, or, once again, reopen the question of Scotlandrsquos place within the United Kingdom.Make no mistake: the next few weeks will see one of the most important elections of our letime.Nicola Sturgeon has demonstrated recently that she only cares about one thing, an independence referendum that most Scots do not want but one that she will still foist upon them anyway. The past year has been tough for us all. Many of us have struggled with the pressures of lockdown, myself included. But the way to recover from this pandemic is not to launch into another constitutional argument that threatens our livelihoods, our childrenrsquos futures and our way of le.As a mum to two lovely boys, I want to see a government that puts aside its own agenda and commits to focusing on whatrsquos best for the next generation of Scots. ldquoJudge me on my record said Nicola Sturgeon on education. Well, the attainment gap remains as large as it ever was, and Scotlandrsquos education system has plummeted in international rankings. It would seem the First Minister has been found wanting.Itrsquos not just our schools that under threat other public services are too. As leader of the Scottish Borders Council, I have fought tirelessly against repeated cuts to our budget, forcing councillors to make dficult choices simply because the Scottish Government finds it easier to pass the buck. After the strain of COVID, we need a Scottish Government that will step up, empower councils and work with them, not against them.Butthe SNP gain enough seats to form a majority in May then all that is at risk. Once again, they will push for another isive referendum.There is only one way to stop that: lend me your constituency vote, and the Scottish Conservatives your party vote, on May .ACMay AC May, Scottish Liberal DemocratsI intend to represent you the only way I know how - by working tirelessly with a keen eye on the future to ensure that there is investment and improvement in education, employment opportunities and business growth. I will stand up for better funded healthcare and demand that money is directed towards care homes, mental health and wellbeing to bring these up to the standards we all deserve. To do this will need a strong economy and the Scottish Liberal Democrats are putting recovery first ndash this must be Scotlandrsquos priority. A vote for me is a vote of confidence for a more secure future for you and your families.Its time for a change. The area needs someone who will heed the concerns of constituents, and voice these strongly in parliament, not just another person sitting in Holyrood applauding every word of the First Minister.Prior to the boundary changes, the Scottish Liberal Democrats had a long record of success here, and its high-time for ato rational, clear thinking on the issues that matter locally and nationally.Our high streets and town centres ndash the beating heart of our communities ndash need urgent help. This was apparent before the pandemic, but even more so now. Online commerce can bring tremendous benefits and is here to stay. Many businesses have transformed to the new normal, but many others have struggled. We need to focus on how growing online spend can coexist with a vibrant local economy, and work to restore community feeling.Im looking forward to getting stuck into the campaign. By their own admission, a ided Tory party has mishandled Brexit, driving Scottish voters in desperation towards nationalism, while the opportunist and populist SNP seeks to compound the disaster of Brexit by withdrawing from the UK completely, just at the point when we need economic recovery the most.A vote for me is a vote for progress through strong partnerships within Scotland, across the UK and with our European neighbours, so that together we can recover from the COVID crisis and move beyond the politics of ision.Katherine Sangster Katherine Sangster, Scottish LabourCOVID-rsquos impact on our families, our communities and our economy has been profound. We now need to start the hard work of rebuilding our country and that task needs new faces, fresh ideas and experience outside of Holyrood.I am a working parent who prior to  had never been involved in politics. However, I like many other parents soon realised that the SNPrsquos childcare policies sound good on the back of an election leaflet but donrsquot work in practice. So, in , I campaigned for fairer access to childcare and led Fair Funding for our Kids - a nationwide campaign that got childcare on to the national agenda, building a movement of mums that demanded action from Government. Our campaign secured more funded childcare from Government - a step towards equality, but there is still plenty to be done.Soon, I was speaking on television, writing for newspapers and lobbying politicians. All things I has never done before but I was speaking from the heart and articulating mine and othersrsquo experience. Now with five years plus experience in politics I still firmly believe that policy is best made by those with lived experience and the job of a politician is to listen and advocate on peoples behalf, and I will always put that at the heart of what I do.Working for an MP now, every day I support people with the issues that blight their lives from poor housing to an inhumane benefits system to bins not getting picked up. These are issues that affect people day in day out. Chatting to voters and speaking to constituents, I have experienced no appetite for debate on a second referendum just a desire from people that we as politicians and aspiring politicians listen to their concerns and respond to those concerns.We need to elect MSPs to Holyrood who understand these concerns and will fully use the powers of the Scottish Parliament to make peoplersquos lives better. Holyrood is one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world lets start using those powers. As Donald Dewar said at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in  ldquoA Scottish Parliament, not an end but a means to greater ends.On May  please use your vote carefully and letrsquos start the task of uniting our country behind our national recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-bank-holiday-offers-big-mac-mcchicken-sandwich","story":"Have you enjoyedthe Bank Holiday weekend a bit too

out of a second lockdown is madness.But local business owners Della Murray and Artur Budenko say it is a leap of faith they are willing to make after taking over the reins of Ramblers Cafeacute in Peebles.The couple, who run a small take-out nestled on Peebles High Street, have been serving the Peeblesshire community throughout the coronavirus pandemic, even going as far as using a taxi

came, we furloughed again and have now brought them all back, and thankfully, we have had no job losses.After surviving the second lockdown, Della said she and Artur were looking to expand as the

Seventeen forts plus additional ldquofortlets were needed to accommodate the ,-, soldiers who are thought to have been stationed along its path. The Antonine Wall reminds us of the far-reaching might of the Roman Empire, a civilisation that inevitably left a huge imprint and influence on the tribes of Caledonia..

And now, more than a week later and despite updates in the interim about the reopening of schools, they#re still waiting – and it#s not acceptable.Like everyone , islanders are desperate to know when they can reconnect with family and friends. Island businesses are equally frantic to know when and how they can make plans for the weeks ahead.But, unlike everyone , our islands are at a complete disadvantage. They still don#t know what is happening, or when. They deserve better. The Scottish Government needs to respond to our islands# call for clarity and let them, like the rest of the country, start to think and plan ahead.Now in its nd year, the Big Garden Birdwatch is a chance for people of all ages to count the number of birds that visit their garden helping the Royal Society for the Protection of Birdsto build up a picture of how they are doing.This year, more than a million people across the UK, including more than , in Scotland, took part, counting  million birds.The event, held over the last weekend in January, revealed the house sparrow held on to its number one spot.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy. Here are some jobs you should be thinking about this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"calls for patience as vaccination programme continues","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Community benefit and shared ownership must, they say, be made a requirement of all future wind farm projects.They also believe residents are at a disadvantage when dealing with complex, jargon-filled planning proposals, and called for the Scottish Government to enforce better community engagement and provide funding towards professional advice for community councils affected by larger developments falling under section  and  of of the Electricity Act .The government must explore alternative arrangements, added the group, for the re-opening of the Machrihanish wind turbine factory.The height and number of turbines is of increasing concern, with recent applications proposing towers up to  metres high # some  per cent taller than many existing structures.The group believes the cumulative effect will negatively impact the area#s scenic beauty and therefore tourism.Bob Chicken, planning convenor for Tarbert and Skipness Community Council, said: #Our communities# needs are being ignored. We believe that our proposals will strike a fairer balance between the need for greener power and the needs of the remote and rural populations who live and work in the lands used to generate it.#The group#s specic concerns were put to renewable energy industry body Scottish Renewables.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, replied by saying that rural Scotland had a #central role# to play in delivering clean power for climate change targets.She continued: #The latest UK Government figures show that only  per cent of Scots are opposed to the development of onshore wind farms. That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#Renewables now provide the equivalent of  per cent of Scotland’s electricity consumption, with onshore wind delivering the bulk of that power, employing , people across the country and supporting a thriving supply chain of businesses from the central belt to the Borders, Highlands and Islands.#"},{"url":null,"title":"man drove on forestry road whilst disqualified","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

Still unable to control his weeping, he began to crawl backwards. Izzy opened the door and cradled him as he crumpled onto the floor in the corridor outside the room.Izzy glanced quickly inside, checking Finn was still asleep. He moved for a moment, then turned over. She slowly and carefully closed the door and sat down with Ewen, putting her arms around him.She had no words, but knew words were not what was needed. She just held him in a hug as he wept his soul out.A fellow guest walked by on the way to the showers. He paused for a moment with a towel hanging over his right shoulder.ldquoYou all right  he asked.ldquoMy friend has just had some bad news, said Izzy.ldquoOK, yeah, I can see that, hope it works out, he said awkwardly and headed for the showers.Finally, Ewen began to compose himself and appeared from behind his hands, his face a sodden mess.

When they entered the kitchen area, everyone instinctively moved away and left them alone. Ewen sat at a table and Izzy put the kettle on.Then she came and sat next to him, putting a supportive hand on his left arm. They both sat, not speaking. Ewen finally stopped crying and Izzy got up and brought some paper kitchen towels so he could wipe his face, then went to make tea for them both. She ed with two steaming mugs and sat by him again, still not speaking, just being there for him, her best friend.He stared at the mug of tea, lted it to his lips, then spoke before he drank.ldquoI hardly recognised him, he said.He took a gulp of tea and looked up at Izzy.His voice began to break as he tried to explain: ldquoItrsquos been four years since I saw him ndash last time was just before his eighth birthday.

Izzy wanted to say yes but the womanrsquos concern and kind words triggered a flood of tears. It was her turn to be comforted, by a stranger who knew nothing of the burden she carried, of her guilt and overwhelming feeling of responsibility.ldquoThank you for being so kind, she said to the woman. ldquoI feel much better now after a wee greet.ldquoNo man is worth such upset, my lovely, the kind woman said.

But she must be careful too.

It was daylight but the sky had clouded over and thick mist hung on the hills.ldquoA typical Highland morning, he said cheerfully.Izzy got things packed as Finn had his shower and they left the hostel before most of the other residents were out of their beds. After a phone call to Finnrsquos mum, they set off.ldquoWhere we having breakfast  asked Finn.ldquoVery close by, on the banks of Loch Dochart.They drove for just a few minutes and pulled into a layby. Izzy performed her usual routine of bringing her rucksack. They walked through some woodland and arrived at the waterrsquos edge.ldquoWow, is that an island with a castle on it  asked Finn.ldquoIt is, said Izzy, ldquoand what stories are here! Irsquoll tell you some over breakfast.Finn helped Izzy set up her stove and they took turns stirring the porridge. There were midges in the air, at times annoying, but it was late in the season and their biting was minimal. A breeze from the loch kept them away most of the time.She told Finn of the castlersquos history, how the island was once a MacGregor stronghold, but that lsquoBlack Duncan Campbellrsquo built the castle they saw now after he took the land.Then Izzy told an ancient legend: ldquoIt was here that Fionn MacCoul met his death, at the hands of a giant named Taileachd.Finn scooped more porridge into his bowl but he nodded, showing he was listening and wanted Izzy to continue.ldquoThe giant lived with his sweetheart, who was a beautul faery maiden.ldquoOf course, said Finn, smiling cheekily.Izzy ed the smile and continued: ldquoSome versions of the tale say they had their home on an island on Loch Lubhair, just downstream, while others an island here on Loch Dochart, maybe even that one.Finn studied the castlersquos ruins, which peered out from the trees which covered the island. It looked so mysterious.ldquoOne day, Taileachd discovered that his sweetheart had met Fionn and they had fallen in love.ldquoSo Fionn ran off with her, thatrsquos ironic! laughed Finn.ldquoNo, you see she loved them both, maybe in dferent ways, but she was now torn between them. They were going to fight over her, and she knew one of them would be killed, so she came up with an idea.Finn put his bowl down and listened as Izzy acted out the tale.ldquolsquoPlease put your anger awayrsquo, said the faery woman. lsquoI love you both, but whoever can leap the furthest I shall be with.rsquoldquoA jumping competition! exclaimed Finn.ldquoExactly!Izzy dramatically described how the two competitors leapt from the island trying to outperform each other. They were equally matched but when they jumped backwards, Fionn momentarily lost his balance and the giant, fearful he was going to lose his sweetheart, took the opportunity to cut off Fionnrsquos head!ldquoAw, ouch, foul! cried Finn.Izzy nodded and spoke with a solemn tone.ldquoIn that moment of violence, they all lost everything. The faery woman fled: she no longer loved Taileachd because of his brutal act, and Fionn, whom she loved, had lost his le. His body floated down the river, and was found by the Fiann, his band of warriors. They buried him at Killin and now they were full of vengeance, so went to search for Fionnrsquos murderer.ldquoDid they find him ldquoWell, Taileachd fled to Rannoch Moor and Irsquoll tell you what happened when we get there, later today.ldquoAw, aunty!Finnrsquos protest was interrupted as his attention was suddenly caught by the sight of a man in a dinghy rowing out into the loch. They watched as he struggled a bit in the current, then vanished behind the eastern side of the island. A few minutes later, the man appeared on top of the ruined tower, half hidden by branches. He sat there.Finn waved and the man waved back.ldquoI really want to go onto that island and see the castle and where the giant lived. Maybe that man will lend us his dingy ldquoHersquos probably going fishing, Finn, and is just looking at the water to see where the fish are.

It seems very unfair that we should no longer be able to use a road that we pay for to access the hills.I noticed a picture on Facebook, taken on a sunny Sunday when people would normally be out enjoying a walk around the reservoir, but only one car seems to be using the car park.As East Lothian grows, we should be utilising as much of our outdoor space as possible to help our population exercise and take pressure off coastlines and popular woodland areas. The Lammermuir Hills are underused for recreation and have a superb network of paths, but woefully inadequate parking.Overriding everything in the letter you printed is the Scottish Governments Land Reform Act of , which clearly states the Right for Responsible Access in Scotland.. The overall framework of land rights, responsibilities and public policies should promote, fulfil and respect relevant human rights in relation to land, contribute to public interest and wellbeing, and balance public and private interests. The framework should support sustainable economic development, protect and enhance the environment, help achieve social justice and build a fairer society.. There should be a more erse pattern of land ownership and tenure, with more opportunities for citizens to own, lease and have access to land.The landownerrsquos decision to heavily restrict parking prejudices families, those with disabilities and groups who take people walking in the hills and need an access point. I understand that during the last year, the countryside has suffered littering, fires and irresponsible parking, but to punish responsible visitors because of the behaviour of a minority is a knee-jerk reaction and will only create animosity towards the estate at a time when public opinion is turning against grouse shooting. Instead, the landowner should be working with local residents, East Lothian Council and interested parties to help improve access and educate visitors on how to visit responsibly.Name and address supplied"},{"url":null,"title":"builders-merchant-built-instead-hotel-former-raceland-site","story":"The former Raceland karting site, between Gladsmuir and Longniddry, closed in early .Work is due to start later this year on a petrol station, two drive-thru restaurants and a drive-thru cafe on the southern section of the site.Initial proposals suggested a hotel could be built on the northern part of the former karting site, where the outdoor track was located, but that could now be ditched for a buildersrsquo merchants.The karting centre was given planning permission in  and also operated a paintball centre.

Wallyford, Tranent and Haddington.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said that the work had been completed except for the erection of the bus shelters, which are not currently in stock and will be installed towards the end of May.She added: ldquoLothian Buses will have staff available on site to assist passengers with the changes.The new measures, funded by the Scottish Government, are temporary for an -month period, and traffic flow, including the times of bus journeys, will be monitored to assess the impact of the changes.The proposals are fully supported by the bus companies and it is hoped the reduced congestion will provide greater reliability of services.The council spokeswoman previously explained that congestion could happen on Musselburgh High Street when one bus had to wait in the carriageway while another was taking on passengers.Relocation and two additional bus stops aim to increase options for passengers, and a bus lane will deter double-parking on the approach to the police station bus stop, leaving sufficient room for vehicles to pass stationary buses.About  parking spaces needed to be removed and the Blue Badge parking space relocated across the road, but the existing taxi rank was unaffected by the changes.The total cost of the project, including detailed design and construction, is pound,, which comes from Transport Scotland via Bus Priority Rapid Deployment Fund.Ward councillor John Williamson said: ldquoThe test will be as lockdown eases and buses become busier, and therefore take longer to load and unload passengers at the bus stops.ldquoAs the measures are temporary, I would hope that it will be possible to tweak the measures in the light of

The arrangement reminds us of the tantalising mystery surrounding these monumental megaliths and begs the question of why they were erected in the first place.Walking around the picturesque site, particularly in the sunshine when huge shadows loom, can be a magical experience.

Seventeen forts plus additional ldquofortlets were needed to accommodate the ,-, soldiers who are thought to have been stationed along its path. The Antonine Wall reminds us of the far-reaching might of the Roman Empire, a civilisation that inevitably left a huge imprint and influence on the tribes of Caledonia..

Iona Abbey, Isle of IonaOn the tiny island of Iona, off the coast of Mull, is one of Scotlandrsquos most sacred historic sites. The site was founded in AD  by St Columba and his Irish following.Many believe the world-famous Book of Kells was made at Columbarsquos monastery, along with other great pieces of art. Despite being the target of many a Viking raid, the monastery survived until the end of the th century, after which a Benedictine abbey was founded.The abbey museum has a collection of early medieval carved stones and crosses on display for visitors. The abbey continues to be an active place of worship after the Iona Community group went to great efforts to revive the sacred structure..

Olsen Renewables, their Reporters ruled none of the objections were strong enough to support refusing planning permission for the turbines.The operators had argued that the case for renewable energy outweighed concerns over the giant turbines.They said: ldquoThe need case for renewable energy development is greater than ever before. Consequently, it would take a local impact of overwhelming importance to justy a refusal of consent, and there is none.East Lothian Council objected to plans to extend the Crystal Rig windfarm project, which straddles its border with the Scottish Borders, over plans to put red lights on top of them to meet CivilAviation Authority regulations.They said: ldquoThe Lammermuirs form the backdrop to East Lothian. The skyline, especially where unbroken, characterises East Lothian.ldquoThe area is characterised by a lack of lighting, creating the perception of an undeveloped area at night.Objecting to the need to put aviation lights on the new turbines because of their height, the council said: ldquoA good example for red lighting when views from East Lothian are the lights on the cranes at the St James Centre. These show how clearly red light travels and that the intensity of the light and weather conditions makes little dference to the distance it can be viewed at.

But they will need a rest at some point. I would repot later in the year, in the autumn, rather than the start of the year,\" says Bishop.Lambell, says spring is a better time for repotting. \"This marks the beginning of growing season , when your plant will be thriving, flourishing and even floweringits the type to produce blooms during the warmer months.\"How often should you repot them \"As a rough timescale, you will need to repot your plant every one to two years, depending on its growth rate,\" says Lambell.\"Most plants will happily repot, but as always, theres no one-size-fits-all rule when it comes to care and youll need to consider the inidual plants needs.\"For example, for a bird of paradise or peace lily to flower, they need to be in relatively small pots. If your plant is currently flowering, try to avoid repotting as this could lead to transplant shock.\"How do you know they need repotting If the plant looks a little lacklustre, or its roots are growing out of the potor is no longer growing quickly and is drying out fast, these are all signs it needs to be repotted, says Lambell.Some plants, such as sansevieria , will throw up new pups . Rather than repotting you can just split those, Bishop suggests.\"Cacti shouldnt need to be repotted because they are so slow-growing and dont have heavy root structures. You wont have to touch a large cactus for five or six years,\" she adds.How should you repot them \"Choose a new pot that is around -cm larger,\" Lambell advises. \"Try not to go much bigger than this - as a rule, dont go beyond two pot sizes bigger - as this can overwhelm the plant with soil and water it doesnt need.\"Once youve chosen the perfect pot upgrade, remove your plant from its existing pot and separate the roots, shaking off the old soil. Pack a layer of fresh soil in the new potand set the plant in. Surround with soil and give it a little water.\"Whatyou dont want a pot-bound plant to grow too big You could split a plant and transplant the pieces into two separate pots, Bishop suggests.\"Where small growths appear on plants such as sansevieria, you just take it out of the pot and just split it, taking off the smaller plants or just break the plant in half. They are really robust and will easily come back.\"Can plants die when you try to repot them \"A lot of plants do suffer from transplant shock, so when you first repot or split them they almost sag and look like they wont survive. But water them and put them back in the same conditions they were originally in and they should be okay,\" says Bishop.\"A lot of people make the mistake of repotting them and then putting them into a dferent room. Ideally put them back to where they originally were.\"Which are good plants for repotting Peace lilies, monsteras, sansevierias, ZZ plants . marantas , tradescantias and philodendron.Are any plants more dficult \"Calatheas are trickier, more sensitive houseplants. I would repot them in a slightly bigger pot, one size up, rather than splitting them. They are happy as long as you feed them and dont change their air conditions too much. Draughts and change of light levels can affect them.\"Flowering plants can be tricky becauseyou dont plant them at the right time you can kill the flower and cause the plant to go into shock,\" says Bishop.Is there a technique to splitting plants \"Be quite fearless,\" says Bishop. \"I tend to split it in half to be left with two big healthy chunks. Then a lot of the nutrients in the roots arent damaged.\"What about compost \"It depends on the type of plant. Theres cactus compost, theres citrus compost. My perfect mix is a houseplant compost to which I add a bit of perlite to allow more drainage.

Officially revealed at the  Geneva Motor Show, the Mini took the motoring world by storm, thanks to its retro looks and classy interior. Then, when they hit the road, it soon became clear BMW had crafted a car that wasnt just great to look at, but great to drive too.Prices started at pound, for the Mini One, rising to pound, for the more powerful Cooper iant, with both being built in Oxford and hitting the market in the UK two months before anywhere  in the world.Arrival of the Cooper SHot on the heels of the One and Cooper iants came the Cooper S. With performance in mind, it combined a .-litre petrol engine with a supercharger, resulting in a lot more power than the standard version. It had a more focused suspension set-up too, while the bonnet air intake became a design feature for all future Cooper S models.Production ramps upIncredibly, by May  ndash just over a year since it went on sale ndash the ,th Mini was produced at BMW Groups Oxford plant. It was a testament to the success of the design and execution of the Mini, thats for sure.The Mini goes drop-topFlash forward to  and the Mini Convertible arrived, bringing that wind-in-your-hair experience to the already-popular model. It still retained space for four, but used a fabric roof that folds up behind the rear seats and didnt require a cover.The boot may have been small at  litres with the roof open, but as with the rest of the range, the Convertible sold like hotcakes.Arrival of the GPThings took a turn for the more serious, with the arrival of the GP in . Limited to just , models worldwide ndash with  made available to UK buyers ndash the lighter, faster and meaner GP sold out before a single customer had even driven a car.Arriving as the most powerful production Mini to date, it used the same .-litre supercharged petrol engine as the Cooper S, but it was boosted for more power while plenty of weight was stripped from the cabin to make the GP even more exciting to drive.The dficult second albumIn August , Mini chose to reveal its second-generation car. It retained the same retro look like the original but was bigger and more efficient than before. The .-litre engine was changed, while the Cooper S used turbocharging instead of supercharging for the first time. Prices increased, too, with the One starting from pound, and the Cooper commanding pound,.Here comes the ClubmanMini took its first step in expanding the range with the introduction of the Clubman in . Debuting a new, estate car-like layout, the Clubman offered more space than the conventional hatch but retained the standard cars nimble handling and punchy range of engines.The start of electricationAt the  Los Angeles Auto Show, Mini presented the E, an electric concept. It created  Mini E vehicles, which were shipped for testing by private customers in Calornia, New York and New Jersey, with the results from this trial relayed back to Mini. It also helped BMW to develop its electric i model.The Countryman hits the roadNot content with the Clubman, Mini expanded the range in  with the Countryman. Taking advantage of the growing appetite for SUVs, the Countryman effectively took the Mini recipe and raised it further off the ground.It had seating for five, four doors and a reasonably large boot. It also retained the same funky styling that you got from the standard hatch.The Roadster and Coupe add even more styleMoving along to  saw the introduction of the Mini Coupe, a two-seater version of the standard hatch which was famously styled to resemble a backwards-facing baseball cap. It was joined by a soft-top version ndash the Roadster. It used a fabric roof like the standard convertible, but had a sleeker, more aerodynamically focused design.A change of pace for MiniIn , Mini introduced the Paceman, which represented a mash-up of an SUV and hatchback. In truth, it was a slightly odd combination, as it had an upright body style but just three doors. Sitting alongside the rest of the Mini line-up, it saw the firms range of cars swell to seven.Third times the charmShortly after the introduction of the Paceman came the introduction of a third-generation hatch. It debuted a new interpretation of the cars classic styling, but was still built in Oxford and was centred around that fun-to-drive experience. Arriving in , the third-generation hatch was bigger in every sense and utilised .-litre three-cylinder engines ndash though the more powerful Cooper S benefitted from a four-cylinder, .-litre petrol.The Mini gains a set of doorsShortly after the arrival of the third-generation Mini came a new, five-door iant, which brought improved rear legroom, a third rear seat, and a more accessible cabin. It has continued to be a great option even today.The Clubman ndash betteredMini followed on from the revitalisation of its hatchback with the introduction of a revised Clubman. It was bigger than before but retained the useful split rear doors, which gave access to a larger boot than before.An electried CountrymanIn , Mini showcased a real attempt at electrication with its Countryman Plug-in hybrid. The first hybrid model to be offered by the brand, it combined a three-cylinder petrol engine with an electric motor and batteries. Capable of driving for up to  miles on battery-power alone, it was easily the most economical car in Minis stable.The Mini goes electricThe year  proved to be a big deal for Mini, as it was when the companys first EV arrived in showrooms ndash the Mini Electric. Its styling was largely unchanged over the regular petrol and diesel models, while a zippy electric motor ensured it delivered the same winning driving experience. The Mini Electric has gone on to prove popular, despite its relatively short range of  miles.The present dayIn January , Mini presented the latest incarnation of its famous hatchback, delivering a new look and a range of technology updates. Though the styling was classical Mini, some key refinements ndash such as a new body-coloured front grille ndash ensure that it has remained looking sharp and up to date."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene-fosters-week-set-titanic-exhibition-know-sinking-ship-see-one","story":"RIGHT, thatrsquos me.

The SNP could have clearly said this election is evidently about the constitutional future of the country , and also, crucially, given its vision of that future, without behaving like Saltire-wrapped obsessives.

Therersquos a sense of boredom too, as most of us have made up our minds on the constitution.The SNP may not have wanted to talk much about independence, but it should have. The prospectus for independence hasnrsquot fundamentally changed much since , but the world is hugely dferent. While Brexit, and the sense of it as an attack on Scottish sovereignty, plays well for the Yes movement, the prospect of EU re-entry and the possibilities it presents around borders pose hard questions.

Alas, the current trend seems to be rapidly to double-down from middle-of-the-road stances to swivel-eyed monomania.Look how fast many Eurosceptics went from wanting out of the EUrsquos political ambit, but staying aligned with the Single Market, to isolationism and banging on about the colour of passports. Or at people who claimed that despite the EUrsquos deficiencies, Remain was marginally preferable, and then plastered EU flags on their social media profiles, tried to stymie a democratic vote and get elected politicians jailed. Independence is even more isive, with both sides ignoring facts or public opinion whenever either clashes with their chosen worldview.It extends into other areas, too. Any proposed reform of the NHS is met by cries that there are days to save it from the privatisation the Tories have apparently been planning for decades, yet somehow never done. Any change to the curriculum heralds the abandonment of spelling, or arithmetic, or history, or alternatively ato Dotheboys Hall. Mild scepticism about lockdown or masks seems often to progress to a conviction that Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, Huawei, Big Pharma and lizard aliens have created a vaccine to control your DNA through G masts.But sometimes such positions become mainstream: no one calls it an obsession when itrsquos widely enough shared. Environmentalism, which from the s until the mid-s was the preserve of the crank Left, is now the principal enthusiasm of Boris Johnsonrsquos government, and the central priority for the CEOs of almost every major international corporation. The cranks are now those who fail to subscribe to the every utterance of a Swedish teenager who left school at  to start yelling at world leaders, or of Extinction Rebellion, a pressure group that likes shutting down city centres and impeding ambulances.Though not one of the dozens of disaster scenarios of environmental doomsayers ndash countries vanishing beneath the waves, famine caused by overpopulation, oil running out, global winter ndash has transpired, that doesnrsquot mean that there are not serious threats to climate and the environment.Itrsquos possible to question the extent to which those are man-made, or whether the cost of a particular change outweighs its benefit, without lurching into the tin-foil-hatted territory of those who deny the overwhelming scientic consensus that there are real, potentially very damaging, global challenges. ANDREW MCKIE:Boris Johnson is right: the rules donrsquot apply to him, by Andrew McKieRather as the current UK government has, despite constantly being characterised as ldquofar-Right, enacted the most Left-wing policies not just for a Tory administration, but of any party in nearly half a century, it has proposed the most far-reaching green policies ndash eventheyrsquore not enough to placate the protesters merrily smashing up bank windows with no heed for the climate costs involved in their replacement.Boris Johnsonrsquos enthusiasm for this agenda is such that his depiction of the UK as the most ambitious and committed country may even be true. The UKrsquos climate target is to keep temperatures lower still than those the Paris Agreement aims for, while banning all conventional and even hybrid cars within a decade, replacing gas boilersand reaching ldquonet zero by  are all measures that go further than almost anyone rsquos plans.The Prime Minister certainly seems to be genuinely committed to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP, being held in Glasgow in November, evensome critics uncharitably claim thatrsquos because hersquos looking forward to the swanking potential this jamboree offers him.Conventional wisdom is that the libertarian and fiscally prudent instincts of Tories should resist environmental restrictions on personal choice and the hugely costly public expenditure they may entail. There are still many in Mr Johnsonrsquos party that take that view.But there is an equally strong strain in Conservatismtowards conservation and environmental concerns. There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of those Tories who proclaim it ndash whether they do so because theyrsquore genuinely convinced of its importance, or from some sort of romantic pastoral vision, or simply because it has become a more mainstream and popular position. ANDREW MCKIE:How do you solve a problem like Russia The trouble with any realistically transformative environmental programme, however, is that it will have tremendous costs. There are obvious economic ones: swapping to fuels and technologies that are, at least initially, more expensive, or the fact that fewer food air-miles mean pricier groceries. But there are also those of convenience and opportunity: EVs place huge limits on range, foreign travel and even meat-eating need to be cut back. For some environmental purists, growth itself is a dirty word, and much of modern le ought to be abandoned.The principal argument of Mr Johnsonrsquos supporters in government is that technology can solve those problems, and indeed those costs. They believe that the more committed they are to the agenda, the more likely it is that prices will fall and innovations develop. Against the doctrines of traditional environmentalists, therersquos some solid evidence for that.The global population is three times larger than it was in , yet instead of mass starvation, we produce more food than ever before, and more cheaply. Infant mortality is a fraction of what it was  years ago, as is absolute poverty. UK emissions are the lowest theyrsquove been for a century and a half. Reforestation, along with many other environmental goods such as bioersity, is actually increasing and damaging practices decreasing in the majority of countries ndash and these trends are strongest in developed nations.On this view, environmental progress is aof economic prosperity, rather than its enemy.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-cant-scots-scotland-use-scots-words-without-called-jakeys","story":"Here is a language that is at least  years old, was spoken by kings and ordinary people, used to write official records, was the language of most of the work of arguably one of the worldrsquos most famous poets, Rabbie Burns, is part and parcel of a nationrsquos identity and, at the last census, was spoken, read or understood by . million people.A language so dferent from English that in , Englishman and scholar Henry Saville described the English and Scots tongues as being dferent as Spanish and Portuguese.

I remember being about seven or eight years old, misbehaving with my brother and sister and our childminder, a feisty but endlessly kind woman from Drumchapel called Helen, putting her coat on and leaving the house, waggling an angry finger at us: lsquoAm norsquo takinrsquo any mair cheek aff you weansrsquo, and us crying after her as she walked down the hill, terried at what our mum and dad would say when they came back from work.lsquoCome back, Helen, ye cannae go, wersquoll be fur it.rsquo And shersquod smile and walk back up the hill.Lelly, as we called her, was no lsquojakeyrsquo. She was hard-working, proud, kind and fiercely loyal. We loved her to bits, and her influence was all over the Super  film of me aged  commentating on a family trip to Loch Katrine sprinkled with some choice Scots words and a strong Glaswegian accent to boot.Watching it is like listening to a favourite piece of long lost music. But, by , five years in a private school had created a homogenised west end, middle class sounding me with not a Scots word in sight, where even the whispering of an lsquoayersquo or a lsquoheidrsquo or a lsquodinnaersquo would elicit utter disdain,not fury from some teachers at the use of what they regarded as lsquoslangrsquo.At the same time as we were all being encouraged to learn as many foreign languages as possible and I wrestled with lsquoOrsquo grade French and German as well as speaking a bit of Urdu and Punjabi at home, another language was being stolen from me without my knowledge. UZMA MIR:One in three people in India has Covid but true figure may be even higherJust as many of us were having Scots taught out of us, others were being made to feel somehow inferiorthey spoke it. Calling the language lsquoslovenlyrsquo or lsquoslangrsquo when working class children had grown up hearing their parents and grandparents speaking it, canrsquot have been healthy for the psyches of those kids.Instead of being praised for being bilingual ndash jumping from Scots to English with total ease when the occasion demanded it ndash many were embarrassed, and took to over-correcting themselves resulting in weird hybrid accents and speech that were not authentic to who they were and where they came from.Some I know rejected all Scots as a way of turning their backs on their working class roots as they eased their way into middle class professions.I literally cringe at having to use this phrase, but the Scottish cringe thing is sadly still alive and well ndash and has got to be one of the most destructive forces in Scottish society.Instead of revelling in the ersity of having three indigenous languages in the country ndash English, Scots and Gaelic ndash we are embarrassed by what makes us utterly unique and still mock and belittle those who celebrate this cultural richness.We choose to prefer to speak just the one language ndash English ndash in a puzzling example of mono-culturalism. Even writing this, Irsquom forced to battle with my rebellious laptoprsquos constant red-lining of the Scots words Irsquom using, as a constant reminder that we live in an English-dominated world, so I better stay in my lane.Fortunately, our artists ndash poets, writers, actors, theatre and filmmakers from Burns to MacDiarmid Jackie Kay to Shuggie Bain author Douglas Stuart, have embraced the beauty, drama and colourfulness of the language in their works. And, of course, the language continues to thrive amongst ordinary Scottish people in their speech as well as through storytelling, songs and poetry.For people like me who are privileged to be able to sit in non-Covid times with an Ayrshire family speaking Scots one weekend, and a Pakistani family speaking Punjabi the next, revelling in the glorious expression of both languages and embracing the uniqueness of two historically oppressed languages that refused to fade away is one of the great gts of living in multi-cultural Scotland.And every time I see Scots or those speaking Scots berated, I remind myself that the Scots language, and other languages like Punjabi, is evolving and changing all the time, but languages can only survivethey are used.

After all, therersquos nothing like a threat to one and all for some to see it simply as a threat to themselves alone and the rest be damned.Irsquom talking about the Covid- pandemic and the insightful and sometimes rather unedying responses to it by those countries that have adequate defences, towards those countries that do not.Be it vaccine, oxygen, ventilator stocks or general health care provision, you canrsquot help but notice a certain, ldquoIrsquom alright, Jack, mentality increasingly prevalent right now.Arguably, it was always going to be this way once those rich developed nations got over the initial shock of being caught wrongfooted by the virus and began to put their house in order. But my, how quickly and unreservedly that safety ladder has been pulled up letting others sink into the abyss.Donrsquot get me wrong, itrsquos only understandable that there should be a palpable sense of relief here in the UK and any country that has managed to turn a corner in the fight against the pandemic. Whatrsquos far less comprehensible though is the misguided notion of singularity or exceptionalism in a global crisis.If ever one detail was a sharp reminder of that, itrsquos the news that India, one of the worldrsquos biggest producers of vaccines, wonrsquot be exporting many for a while.This means that COVAX, the global initiative aimed at equitable access to the Covid- vaccine, has lost much of the supply produced by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India.In the words of one vaccine expert, ldquoright now COVAX has ground to a shuddering halt... wersquore at the point of where wersquore trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.This in turn means that many of the poorer countries that were relying on such supplies will be impacted and even some of the richer ones in Europe and where who are beginning to exit the crisis could well find themselves affected.In other words, here once again is more proof ndashit were needed ndash of the truism that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Whatever happened to those leaders and governments that were once enthusiastic chanters of such a mantra  It didnrsquot take long it seems for them to forget the words to this chorus of caringFor the grim inescapable fact is that while many in the West are cock-a-hoop about the rapid roll out of vaccines, the pandemic is gathering pace where. India is the most obvious recent example, but many now fear that numerous African countries are about to plummet down that same terrible track.ldquoTwo months ago, India was doing a victory dance and handing out vaccines around the world like candies, observed Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, which is co-ordinating distribution on the continent.ldquoThey were saying how wonderfully they had done because of the immunity and the youth of their population. Look where India is today, was Dr Alakijarsquos timely reminder this week.Indiarsquos catastrophe is all the proof needed, say health experts like her, of what could happen in Africavaccination campaigns are not rapidly accelerated, and the virus is allowed to spread and mutate. And Africa of course is not unique in this respect with South and Central America experiencing another surge that contributed this week to a record near million cases reported globally on a single day.So much of what has unfolded politically around the world during the pandemic has given us an insight, sometimes chilling, into the way global politics and many governments and leaders worldwide operate.What lessons might we take for example from the fact that the top five slots in the geographical mortality rankings all belong to countries run by populists when the pandemic began ndash the US, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Britain.As Gideon Lasco, a leading global medical anthropologist at the University of the Philippines, noted recently ldquomedical populist politicians like Indiarsquos Prime Minister Narendra Modi, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, and former US president Donald Trump, all rose to power and ruled in populist styles.This allowed for an oversimplication of the pandemic and enabled them to flag up their own frequently misguided solutions while forging isions across their nations in the process.What to make then of the call this week by Gordon Brown to the foreign ministers of the worldrsquos leading economies, meeting in London as part of the G Summit, to fund a bn two-year vaccine and healthcare support package for poor countries On the face of it, Mr Brownrsquos humanitarian rallying call makes sense. But coming as it does in the wake of the UK Governmentrsquos bafflingly stupid decision to cut le-saving overseas aid for water and sanitation projects amid the pandemic, it only underlines the mixed motives and messages coming from nations in the developed world.At its most cynical and some might even argue predatory level, there are those countries, too, who now clearly view their capacity to supply vaccines through the prism of international competition.If we give you desperately needed vaccines, you give us concessions goes the current thinking. These concessions might take the shape of access to natural resources and markets or helping turn the screw on political rivals as China has done in pressuring other countries into derecognising Taiwan infor vaccine supplies.Itrsquos all a far cry from those early days of the pandemic when some global leaders spoke of universal vaccines and aid as a moral course of action and the way to bring about the swtest end to a disease that affects us all.If the pandemic has perhaps taught us anything and is still teaching us, itrsquos the lesson that responding intelligently to a global crisis of this kind depends on people in high office being smart enough to listen and co-operate with one another. Admittedly, there have been some examples of that, but in the main precious few that really matter.Instead, what we are witnessing now is an ever-more clearly defined demarcation line between those nations able and those less able to cope. The ladder is undeniably being hauled up behind the latter. It has become a tale of two pandemics, not one in which we can claim any longer to be ldquoall in this together.David Pratt is Contributing Foreign Editor.

The Michelin star has brought great joy and while it was disappointing that we couldnrsquot share it with people at the time in lockdown, it makes it all the more exciting when we do open the doors and welcome people in, said Ms McNee, who trained with the late Andrew Fairlie at his two Michelin star restaurant at the five star Gleneagles hotel.ldquoI donrsquot think there is any feeling like it having a Michelin star. It is amazing and for me as a young chef starting out that is what I strived for. It is quite surreal.ldquoReopening will be about a celebration and it is a time when people will once again be able to mark important milestones and come together in a way they have not be able to recently. It is not just about making great food, it is about being able to bring people into the restaurant and to start to enjoy themselves again.Read more: Covid Scotland: Pandemic set to open floodgates for damages claims, says legal expertWhile diners have still be able to connect with Cail Bruich through the hugely successful dine at home menus, reopening as a Michelin star restaurant while undoubtedly spark a lot of interest.ldquoI think we will get a iety of people through our doors. There are people who travel to Michelin star restaurants from all over the UK, we have our loyal customers and then there might be people in the Glasgow area who havenrsquot had the opportunity to go to a Michelin star restaurant before and will come along, added the -year-old from Morayshire. ldquoWe know that what we do wonrsquot be to everyonersquos tastes, but there will be people who will want to come now because we have the Michelin star.Congratulations came in from the Glasgow hospitality industry and further afield when the announcement was made. There was also messages from fellow Michelin starred chefs now that Ms McNee and Cail Bruich have joined the elite club. Following on from the Michelin star, champagne house Krug invited Ms McNee to become an Ambassade, part of a network of top chefs who develop dishes paired with the fine brand.ldquoGlasgow was very supportive of us when we received the award and we had lots of lovely messages,\" said the head chef who was just five months into her new role when they were awarded the star. \"We really felt that the city had got behind us. The Michelin star is a great boost to the city and the hospitality industry in Glasgow. It can make others more competitive and to strive to be as good as they can and it also made people happy that someone had brought a Michelin star back to the city.Menu planning has been underway for some time and the restaurant opened its reservation book last Friday, April , to welcome people back on Wednesday May . And while not giving too many secrets away, there is a little hint of what diners can expect.Ms McNee added: ldquoIt will be a tasting menu we have on offer when we reopen. There wonrsquot be a massive change, but we want to continually get better and better in everything we do.ldquoWhen we closed our doors before lockdown, it was autumn and as someone who is passionate about seasonal produce, so the menu is going to reflect summer and late spring. Scottish asparagus will be in season when we open so expect to see that on the menu along with langoustines which are my absolute favourite. We are also experimenting with duck dishes and how long we are going to age it.ldquoThe team have been tasters, from the kitchen to front of house. Their input and opinion is important. With young chefs they might not have a fully developed palate yet so it is about bringing them on and with front of house it is important they know about the suppliers, how it tastes, to be able to help diners make their informed choice.The Cail Bruich team already had a good relationship with suppliers in the area and across Scotland when they were awarded the Michelin star, but it did lead to some people getting in touch with them direct.ldquoThere have been some places who got in touch such as Blackthorn Scottish Sea Salt [from Ayrshire] who sent their product which is phenomenal. So we will be using that because I think it is a great product and offers something in terms of taste.When bookings opened on Friday, general manager Chris Donnachie said they werenrsquot quite sure what to expect following lockdown closures. However, they werenrsquot left disappointed as by the end of the day they were fully booked to near the end of June, the period of time they had opened bookings up for.ldquoI think there was a little apprehension as we had been closed for some months now, but the response has been quite unbelievable, said Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe are fully booked through to near the end of June which was the point we wanted to get to as covid restrictions may well ease further from then.ldquoWhen Cail Bruich was awarded the Michelin star earlier this year, we would have loved to have been able to open the next day to mark that but it was a time of lockdown. Such a huge part of what we do and revel in is the social interaction with our guests. Scotland has such a warmth in the sense of its hospitality and we love providing that experience.Working in partnership with Scottish brands to develop their own offerings has seen Cail Bruich work with Glasgow-based The Garden Shed Drinks Company to stock their own gin, a collaboration with beer firm Pilot and they are also planning to stock their own tonic water through a link up with Walter Gregorrsquos handcrafted tonic firm.As for the future the Cail Bruich team believe a second Michelin star is not an unrealistic expectation and they have also added to the team with the addition of two new front of house staff and two new kitchen staff.ldquoWhen we reopen we want to smash it out the park and exceed expectations and we certainly do have aspirations for a second star, added Mr Donnachie. ldquoWe believe we have the capability to do that with a fantastic team."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-referendum-wont-happen-neither-side-wants-one","story":"Boring because there has been no contest ndash everyone knows the winner already. Signicant because it could mean the end of the United Kingdom. At least, that is the view of the London media. The reality is both boring and signicant: there is not going to be a referendum because neither side actually wants one right now.Curiously, the expectation of a referendum seems to be greater in Westminster than in Holyrood. Weve been hearing muffled cries of panic from Whitehall for months. Former Cabinet Office mandarins like Ciaran Martin insist that following this victory for the parties of independence there is ldquono democratically legitimate basis to refuse a referendum. Boris Johnson is still minded to say ldquonow is not the time, but his constitutional insecurity is demonstrated by the fact that hes afraid to show his face in Scotland to defend the Union at this critical juncture.There is talk of a court challenge against the SNPs forthcoming independence bill. Thatsthe Scottish Government doesnt get there first. Theres also going to be ldquobillions on road and rail spending with a Union Flag on it ndash even a ldquofixed crossing to Northern Ireland, or so were told. The Internal Market Act will allow the UK Government to spend over the heads of Holyrood and win hearts and minds. Well, perhaps.Read more: WhatBoris Johnson rejects second referendum Yet curiously, Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that this election ldquois not about independence. The very idea! Its about her ldquosensible leadership and recovery from Covid, under the only political leader who seems to want the job. A referendum will not happen until ldquothe crisis is over, which could be many years since the economic Covid crisis has yet to begin.This may seem like a remarkable about-face for the SNP leader. For the past two years, she has talked of little  but a referendum on independence. Even Covid was expressed in constitutional terms: ldquoAn independence referendum is an essential priority, she said repeatedly,Scotland was to build back better after the pandemic.As recently as November, her Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, insisted that there would a referendum ldquonext year by which he meant . The Constitution Secretary, Michael Russell, said in January that the referendum would happen by Christmas, with or without a Section  Order from Westminster. ldquoThe Franchise Act was approved last year, he said, ldquoso the nuts and bolts are there.Buttomorrows election is really all about ldquoseeking a clear endorsement for a referendum on independence as Ms Sturgeon told parliament in September, you might have thought it would be right up there, centre stage. Yet two words absent from the SNP leaflet that came through my door last week were ldquoindependence and ldquoreferendum. It seems it no longer regards it a necessary precondition for Covid recovery or for keeping Mr Johnsons grasping Brexit hands off the fragile powers of the Scottish Parliament.The UK Government regards all this as devious down-playing of indyref rhetoric, all the better to propel Scotland into holding one. On Saturday, it thinks, she will suddenly declare that this election had ldquoof course been about an independence referendum, and that the mandate for holding one is now unanswerable. Ms Sturgeon will no doubt say something like this, but I dont think that means there will be a referendum on the timescale her minions had been suggesting. Ms Sturgeon isnt a loser, and her recent silence on crucial post-Brexit issues of border, currency and debt betrays her lack of confidence in winning any early referendum.Read more: Sturgeonrsquos border problem could possibly kill Yes vote stone deadThe First Minister made clear this week that she favours turning indyref into a battle in the courts. When ldquothis crisis is over Holyrood will pass a bill declaring a referendum and then defy Westminster to strike it down. Actually, it doesnt have to because no act of Holyrood, especially one on the constitution, can pass without the express endorsement of the UK Parliament.It was clear in the Miller case in  that the UK Supreme Court, which would ultimately decide this matter, takes a maximalist view of parliamentary sovereignty. It believes that Westminster can safely ignore any act of the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel Convention, which supposedly requires Westminster to consent to acts of Holyrood, is just that: a convention. The constitution is one of the reserved powers retained at Westminster under the  Scotland Act.In response, the Scottish Governments lawyers will argue that, while Holyrood cannot legislate for a legally-binding referendum on independence, it can legislate for and hold a consultative referendum. Ms Sturgeon has long accepted that a full-fat referendum would require a Section  Order from Westminster, but an indy-lite plebiscite, just asking the views of Scottish voters, is probably within Holyroods powers. Local authorities are empowered to hold referendums on water privatisation and road pricing, so why shouldnt Holyrood Whether she would actually want such a non-binding referendum is of course another matter. I seriously doubtshe would because it would likely be meaningless. Since it carries no constitutional weight, most unionists would likely boycott it. It would be like the  Catalonian referendum in which  per cent voted Yes on a % turnout. It might carry even less meaning than a series of opinion polls, which are probably a more accurate reflection of what Scotland actually thinks.So why bother with pursuing this through the courts  Well, perhaps because it would be a way of parking the whole independence issue. Indeed, fighting a phoney war about a referendum that will never happen might suit both sides. Passions would overflow in the synthetic world of social media while lawyers exchanged abstruse formulations of a problem that doesnt actually exist about a referendum that would never happen.Its something a French post-modernist, like Jean Baudrillard would instantly recognise: a meta-battle fought over signs and signiers of independence rather than self-government itself.

Throughout the campaign, Nicola Sturgeon has made much of her being the only serious contender for First Minister while opposition leaders have conceded that their focus is on securing second place.Every poll conducted during the campaign and for many months prior has pointed to an SNP victory less certain is whether the party can repeat its feat of  by securing the  seats needed for an overall majority, thus giving the party the strongest possible mandate to push for a second independence referendum in the next few years.This poll indicates that may still happen, suggesting an overall majority albeit by just two seats with the party tallying . Interestingly it also suggests that the SNP may achieve that milestone by virtue of the constituency part of the ballot alone, gaining  of the  seats available in that part of the election.Ironically of course this means that the emergence of new parties to try and encourage voters to use their regional list vote more tactically may prove to be mootthe SNP can govern as a majority administration.But eventhat does not happen this poll, putting Alba at % on the regional list ballot, suggests that the party of the former First Minister Alex Salmond is not poised to make any signicant breakthrough in terms of the independence lsquosuper majorityrsquo it craves.At % on the constituency ballot and % on the regional list, this poll follows the pattern of surveys from last weekend which suggest an uptick in SNP support following some more modest polls for the party where its vote share fell to around % on the constituency and % on the regional list, a result which would leave them short of a majority.:Dumbarton constituency profile as Holyroods tightest fightThe SNP mantra in the closing stages of the campaign is to reinforce its message to voters about the leadership of Nicola Sturgeon and it is true that her approval ratings signicantly outperform those of the other party leaders.

This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Change needs to be made.”Among those giving evidence to the committee in February was Deirdre Shakespeare, who said that while permission was granted by Harry’s parents to be put in a chair at mealtimes, the extent of the use of restraints was now the subject of a legal dispute.The campaign for Harry’s Law would make it compulsory for schools to report to parents and the Education Authority when they had restrained or isolated a pupil. It could take another step forward with Assembly backing.Any changes would also mean that more school staff are trained in other, positive ways to address a child’s behaviour.After the committee evidence in February, Paris Hilton issued a message to her  million Twitter followers, appealing to the committee and its chairman, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, to provide “meaningful protections” for children.In February, Ms Hilton testied to the Utah state senate about abuse she said she suffered as a teenager at a boarding school, including being forced into solitary confinement naked and being beaten.Mrs Shakespeare said she was pleased the issue was receiving so much attention and said her chance to address MLAs had been “very powerful”, but she added that so many more children will have suffered harm because so much time has been wasted in updating laws.Mrs Shakespeare is hoping more parents who have had similar experiences with their children will now come forward. She appealed to all those affected to complete her survey at www.surveymonkey r ICARSNI. It can be done anonymously.The motion will be forwarded to the Assembly’s Business Committee, with the Education Committee hoping it can be debated “as soon and urgently as possible”.A spokesperson for the department of Education said: “The Department for Education is considering the issues of restraint and seclusion, in partnership with stakeholders. To take this forward the Department has set up a Working Group which includes Departmental policy officials, the Education and Training Inspectorate , the Education Authority, and officials from the Departments of Health and Justice.

Read MoreCentenary poll: % in Northern Ireland want referendum but would not accept higher taxes to fund reunicationCentenary poll suggests only % of people in Northern Ireland consider Irish language to be importantEsmond Birnie:OpinionOur economy needs recuperation, not a constitutional shockThe Union would be better served by making strong economic arguments for its preservation, rather than politicians heading down the rabbit hole of poking their noses into people#s bedrooms and private lives.Our poll findings suggests that nationalists have a job of work to do to make a strong financial case for a united Ireland, although that is certainly not an impossible task.!fordocument.querySelectortThe Scottish Government produced a -page white paper laying out the case for independence in . There is no sign that a similarly comprehensive blueprint is on the horizon from nationalists here.Our poll indicates that the strongest argument unionists could employ is that Irish unity would hit people in their pockets on both sides of the border.More than half in Northern Ireland think they#d be worse off with just % believing they#d prosper. But % of people were unsure, meaning that the economic arguments on both sides really need to be formed and aired.!fordocument.querySelectortIn the Republic, four in  thought they#d be worse off in a united Ireland, one in five disagreed, and a staggering % didn#t know. If RTE hasn#t already planned it, another Claire Byrne Live to shed light on this part of the debate would be warmly welcomed.A majority on both sides of the border said they wouldn#t be prepared to pay more taxes to fund Irish unity.!fordocument.querySelectortNorthern Ireland currently receives a £bn annual subvention from Westminster. Almost half of people in the Republic said they#d match thator pay some of it . A third were totally opposed to doing so.But the £bn figure is disputed. It#s the UK statistical calculation that encompasses costs which nationalists believe wouldn#t transfer to a new united Ireland. Those costs include UK government debt interest, contributions to the UK armed forces and pension liabilities.!fordocument.querySelectortStill, Northern Ireland#s low cost of living and high number of public sector jobs will be extremely successful weaponsunionists are forced to do battle in a border poll.The jewel in the crown will of course be the NHS. Six in  voters here would be uncomfortable about transferring to the Republic#s health service.Changing it to a system similar to the NHS with free access and no prescription charges would surely be essential for nationalists in a future referendum. The British Treasury footing the bill during the pandemic for the furlough scheme also gives unionists strong ammunition.However, nationalists will be able to use Northern Ireland#s poor infrastructure, low wages, and very small private sector in their arguments. They will also suggest that considerable economic opportunities and potential investment could open up in the event of Irish unity.This poll gives Irish unity campaigners many reasons to pause for thought. Yet it also counters claims made by those who oppose constitutional change. The idea that the south doesn#t want the north is contradicted.More than two-thirds of people in the Republic support Irish unity with just % against.In Northern Ireland, there was a clear pro-Union lead - % to %, with % undecided.Some % of people here want a border poll compared to % opposed in the Republic two-thirds want one. Among referendum supporters, seven in  on both sides of the border want one now or within five years. Those figures suggest that the Taoiseach, who has dragged his feet on the issue and ruled out a border poll in coming years, is out of step with voters.The th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in  is the date many nationalists are now speaking of for a referendum.The economic recovery of both the UK and the Republic post-pandemic will be key to the unity debate. If one state fares remarkably better than the other that will sway a signicant amount of Northern Ireland voters.Belfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralUTV’s Jane Loughrey goes from poacher to gamekeeper as she lands new job with South Eastern Health Trust‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureDerry Sinn Fein MLAs Martina Anderson and Karen Mullan stepping downRangers ‘in discussions’ over Northern Ireland trip as Steven Gerrard recalls ‘low point’ of England’s Windsor Park defeatTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlaySir Jeffrey Donaldson announces DUP leadership bidPlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast Latest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestVoters heading to polls for crucial Holyrood electionWho is up for election and how long will results take Voters across Great Britain go to the polls on Super ThursdayHarry and Meghan to celebrate Archie’s second birthdayUK sending Navy ships to Jersey amid post-Brexit fishing rights row,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those who favour a united Ireland have responded in a number of ways to this situation:Deny the figures - yes, about £bn of the transfer is an attributing to NI of spending done by the UK central government . But, in a united Ireland surely some of such spending would continue Claim taxes could rise - they could, but, as this poll shows, there would be considerable opposition to that, especially in the Republic.Claim public spending in NI could be scaled back - it is one thing to argue our public sector is too large in relative terms, but any sudden adjustment would probably provoke a major recession. Claim a united Ireland could out-grow the problem - true, in recent years the Republic#s economic growth rate has surpassed that in NI, even discounting the tax-avoiding behaviour of multinationals, but can we really assume that unity per se would have a sudden transformative impact on NI#s economic performance Claim that the Dublin government could borrow to keep NI afloat - at the moment, interest rates are very low, but that won#t always be true.Argue that the UK Government would leave its cheque book behind - in the s, the London government wrote off the Irish Free State#s obligation for part of the UK#s public debt, but can we really imagine a UK government being so generous as to wipe out debt and continue to pay for some welfare benefitsand subsidise NI#s infrastructure To be fair, this existence of the big fiscal deficit is also problematic for unionists. They could claim other UK regions have deficits. They do, but none are so large. They could try to argue this is a form of UK solidarity payment, but will that really wash with taxpayers in south-east England The biggest danger is that a long-term dependency on subsidy from Great Britain has actually distorted economic behaviour. As RHI exemplied, free money trumps making necessary reforms.One particularly interesting area of Northern Ireland-Republic comparisons is healthcare: a major focus of the Kantar Belfastpoll.The south uses a mixture of state provision and private insurance. The polling response shows a very strong preferences in NI to continue with the NHS model. That said, the advantages of free at the point of use are blunted by our ening waiting lists.OECD data implies healthcare spending per person in the Republic now exceeds that in NI and the UK average.Of course, as indicated by US experience, very high spending does not necessarily bring better quality. We know the dference in Covid vaccination rates.To finish with a health analogy, for all its points of strength, the NI economy remains in need of intensive care - a period of recuperation, rather than a major constitutional shock is probably the priority.Dr Esmond Birnie is senior economist at Ulster UniversityBelfast Most ReadBobby Sands burial wishes ignored in favour of ‘political beneficial’ Belfast funeralUTV’s Jane Loughrey goes from poacher to gamekeeper as she lands new job with South Eastern Health Trust‘Tough loss’ for Belfast as Holohans at the Barge restaurant announces closureDerry Sinn Fein MLAs Martina Anderson and Karen Mullan stepping downRangers ‘in discussions’ over Northern Ireland trip as Steven Gerrard recalls ‘low point’ of England’s Windsor Park defeatTop VideosPlayWatch: Suzanne Breen gives her take on the DUP leadership racePlaySir Jeffrey Donaldson announces DUP leadership bidPlayPro-united Ireland poster removed from Divis Tower in Belfast Latest The CentenaryThree young voices... why I feel Northern Irish, why I feel British and why I feel IrishCentenary poll: Public ided on terror amnesties as pardons for terrorists and troops leave people tornSuzanne BreenOpinionNorthern Ireland#s a powderkeg... but will of people must always prevailCentenary poll: #Irish unity would jeopardise peace in Northern Ireland# - survey confirms hardening of views in unionist communityCentenary poll: People from NI more likely to cross Irish border than southern counterparts LatestVoters heading to polls for crucial Holyrood electionWho is up for election and how long will results take Voters across Great Britain go to the polls on Super ThursdayHarry and Meghan to celebrate Archie’s second birthdayUK sending Navy ships to Jersey amid post-Brexit fishing rights row,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Under new leadership, we are putting working people and their communities first.“Your priorities will always be Labour’s priorities, with Labour councils, councillors and mayors utterly focused on delivering the secure jobs, safer streets and health services we all want to see.“They are the first step of Labour’s plan to rebuild Britain, based on security and opportunities across the country.”The Prime Minister insisted it would be a “very tough fight” to win Hartlepool, a seat that has been Labour since its creation in .The Conservatives hope to achieve a “hat trick” of successes, winning Hartlepool and retaining the mayoralties in Teesside and the West Midlands.Mr Johnson said: “It’s Conservative mayors who are bringing new investment and local jobs to their areas. A new freeport and green jobs are on their way to Teesside and new trams,lines and station upgrades to the West Midlands.“More has been delivered by Conservatives in four years than complacent Labour politicians have delivered in decades.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaad .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_bfa-c-ac-be-fdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaad .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_bfa-c-ac-be-fdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaad .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_bfa-c-ac-be-fdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk aaad .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_bfa-c-ac-be-fdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFor Labour, success is expected in the form of Sadiq Khan winning a second term in London.While the results in England will determine who runs key authorities and give an indication of the state of politics ahead of the next general election due in , the contest in Scotland could have a far greater impact.The SNP is certain to emerge again as the largest party in the Scottish Parliament after the election, but it wants to win an overall majority of MSPs as it pushes for a second independence referendum – something which polls suggest remains in the balance.Mr Johnson has refused to countenance another referendum, setting up the potential for constitutional fireworks over the coming yearsMs Sturgeon gets the outcome she desires.Ms Sturgeon insisted her focus would be on tackling coronavirus and rebuilding the economy.But “when the Covid crisis has passed, we will give the people of Scotland the opportunity to decidethey want the recovery to be in the hands of the likes of Boris Johnson and the austerity-driven Tories, or to put Scotland’s future in Scotland’s hands with independence”.She said: “Despite the challenges of the last year, we should be optimistic about Scotland’s future – and with the right leadership I know that we have the natural resources and human talent to deliver the fairer, greener and more prosperous Scotland that we all want to see.”🗳 It really is on a kne edge.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace. The present funding methodology is flawed and operates without evidence base or up-to-date benchmarks. Last week at Stormont, cross-party support was achieved for the inclusion of death, dying and bereavement in the Programme for Government and I very much welcome that. It is progress but we have a long way to go. We need to give much more sustainable support to our end-of-le care providers. We must not forget that these organisations are lting the burden from the NHS which is why core funding is so important. Given the exceptional nature of this year, there is also a need for additional mental health resources to help deal with COVID’s psychological toll, especially for those grieving in our rural areas and those who have a limited network of support. This pandemic has reminded us that palliative and end-of-le care is a vitally important part of our care system and I believe it has opened up an important conversation around dying and bereavement.  Grief is a normal, albeit sad and challenging, part of le. We will all experience the pain of losing a loved one at some point. However, I believe there is no doubt that the current pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to the grieving process, setting the stage for more complex and prolonged reactions for many who have lost loved ones. My SDLP colleagues and I will continue to press for more sustainable provision for the dying and bereaved and call for urgent, additional resources to tackle the poor mental health some of our bereaved families are likely to suffer as a result of loss in what have been traumatic conditions.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His daughter and SDLP Causeway Coast and Glens councillor, Helena Dallat OrsquoDriscoll, reflects on the past year.Just weeks before my fathers passing, with the COVID death toll rising, Northern Ireland had entered lockdown in a bid to limit the spread of coronavirus. The Health Minister, Robin Swann, had described the potential scale of the impending surge as being of biblical proportions and for the next year, people would live a new normal - no unnecessary journeys, no mixing with other households, working from homepossible and many other restrictions on daily le. Two days after the announcement of the restrictions, we were hit with the news that my father’s cancer treatment had met an unexpected twist and he had weeks to live. googletag.cmd.push Like many families in Northern Ireland, we were to care for and say goodbye to a loved one in lockdown. It is hard to believe that a year has passed since dad died, in some ways time has stood still. I think most families bereaved in the last year will be experiencing a similar feeling. A lack of closure comes with a lockdown death, especiallyrestrictions were at their height. Although a small number of us were privileged to be with dad at the moment he died, we missed the rituals that we had all come to expect as normal. googletag.cmd.push As a society, we have such a respect for the dead and the bereaved, regardless of culture or faith but COVID upended all those customs and comforting gestures. As was the case for many families, we had no wake and we were unable to keep his remains at home. We didn’t carry his coffin. The church was almost empty for his funeral. The only physical touch at his graveside was from our very immediate family. From that moment, I realised that, even as a mum of two tactile daughters, I had totally underestimated physical touch and how it comforts and modulates emotions.     Having no visitors in the months following a death also adds to the feeling of isolation and I have felt particularly for those who might be living in remote areas or who don’t have their families close by.  All things considered, we were one of the luckier families. Although there was a feeling of isolation and loneliness due to the restrictions, at least the conditions were sufficiently safe for us to be with dad at the end. Thanks to first-class medical care from his consultant, our GPs, district nurses, carers and our NI Hospice community hospice nurse, we were able to care for him at home. Our community hospice nurse, in particular, taught us invaluable lessons. We quickly learned about symptom assessment and pain relief but also the preciousness of le and how to let someone with so precious little time left live as fully as possible until the end. He also died with nothing important left unsaid. Many other families never got a chance to nurse or say goodbye to their loved ones because of COVID circumstances and I find that unimaginably heartbreaking. It was a first lesson in just how vital our hospice services are. However, despite their critical nature, their futures are frequently faced with uncertainty. The demands on our palliative and end-of-le care services are steadily increasing but funding has not kept pace.

The bars had been planning to open for outdoor eating and drinking as part of the latest easing of Covid- restrictions. However, they have now been told that they cannot reopen due to guidelines what constitutes an outdoor space. The Department of Health said the general rule of thumb is that outdoor premises should not be more than % enclosed. The definition of enclosed and substantially enclosed comes from the smoke-free legislation from  and is directly referenced in the restriction regulations, a spokesperson said. This was the same definition that was in place since last July and is not part of the recent amendments which will allow outdoor hospitality to open from  April. googletag.cmd.push Among the local pubs impacted are the Magnet Bar at Culmore, Molly Malones in Ballymagroarty and the Happy Landing in Eglinton. They have had to inform customers that they will not be able honour bookings made for Friday. These pubs will now have to wait until May  when indoor bars will be allowed to reopen. Colin Neill, the chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said the interpretation of regulations was far too stringent. The idea of outdoor [hospitality] being opened again is meaninglessonly a relatively small number of venues can actually make it work, he said. Many will have prepared for reopening by buying thousands of pounds worth of stock to replenish their empty bars, only to be told that their set up does not meet the regulations, despite being open to the same standard in previous failed reopening phases. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone has welcomed the financial support and has urged DAERA Minister Edwin Poots not to delay payments any longer than necessary.

I know there will be many businesses across our city and district really excited to open their doors today after a turbulent and dficult past year. I hope that everyone will support those businesses in the weeks and months ahead as they try toto normality, said MayorTierney. googletag.cmd.push In doing so, I would ask everyone to please make sure theyre following the health guidelines in place including wearing a face mask where required and always maintaining social distancing.

It is new ground and it will take time to adapt.Through his underage, ODoherty was often balancing school, club and county action. “You know what is happening and when it is happening,” he said. “It is set in stone, you will see going forwardit is successful and hopefully it is.“It is a dferent mindset.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

The proposal, brought by Cllr Aaron Callan of the DUP, seconded by the UUPs Richard Holmes and supported by Alderman Alan Robinson , Cllr Russell Wattonand Independent Cllr McCandless, would see the Union flag flown on the buildings for  days a year.

Therefore the following buildings would fly the flag in accordance with this policy Coleraine Town Hall, Cloonavin Council Headquarters, Limavady Office , Roe Valley Arts and Cultural Centre, Ballymoney Town Hall, Riada House, Portrush Town Hall and Portstewart Town Hall. googletag.cmd.push This list of buildings will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.

Planning officers have recommended refusing planning permission for the  new apartments within a six-storey building on a vacant plot on Northland Road between Clarence Avenue and the Magee campus of Ulster University. However, the final decision on the proposal rests with councillors on Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. A decision had been deferred from last months meeting of the planning committee. The committee held its monthly meeting today and the Clarence Avenue plans were on the agenda. However, a decision on the apartments plans was again deferred until the committees meeting next month as a result of the amount of late information about the application which had been submitted to the planning department. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, a decision on the apartments plans was again deferred until the committees meeting next month as a result of the amount of late information about the application which had been submitted to the planning department. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I was working on my university dissertation with a friend when my coach phoned me and told me the news. I really went through the motions.Griggs told Hogan that she would be starting in the No  role, not her usual second row position on the pitch.ldquoAdam said that he knew I had to adjust to playing the role but that he was confident that I was capable of doing that, she continued.ldquoDue to the lack of playing time because of Covid- the coach wanted to try me out in dferent field positions to see what Irsquoll suit best.ldquoI knew from my background all the roles the second row has to do. I had been doing some back row work in training but itrsquos a dferent set-up in defence. So I wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing and where I needed to be.The third place decider took place in Donnybrook, Dublin, after the fixture was relocated from Parma due to quarantining issues.ldquoItaly decided to come over to Dublin due to Covid-, which was great of them. That acted as a comfort as I was in similar surroundings when we played France, said Hogan.Ireland started the match strongly, with the game plan of keeping the ball tightly in control until the hour mark. The green and white outfit betted on having the superior stamina over their Italian counterparts which would ultimately help them see off the game comfortably.ldquoWe certainly kept them into the middle of the field throughout the first half, said Hogan.ldquoWe knew coming into the game that we had to be patient andwe wanted the result we needed to be in control until at least  minutes had went on the clock.ldquoWe knew our test fitness is better than Italyrsquos and we would have the legs to get over the line.Ireland faced an early scare when they lost their captain Ciara Grfin to a head injury assessment within the opening quarter of the game. Grfin was subsequently replaced with Hannah OrsquoConnor.ldquoWe had prepared foranyone got a yellow card whilst in training, so when Ciara went off the field we had an idea on how to manage, said Hogan.ldquoWe had Hannah come on the pitch and with her leadership she showed great composure and intelligence. I think we did really well considering we lost our captain.Ireland maintained in control and comfortably seen out the contest to secure third place in this yearrsquos Six Nations.

This generation will not be the one that fails it.Last week, the health minister was asked to provide clarity on the future role of the Downe Hospital with the appeal by South Down MLA Colin McGrath coming after Mr Swann warned that the health service should not be used as a political football in the run-up to next Mayrsquos Assembly elections.He said attempts to rebuild and revitalise the health service in Northern Ireland must not be hijacked by politicians hoping to win votes and called on his Stormont colleagues to support transformation that will result in better patient outcomes.Outlining plans for the health service as the province edges out of lockdown, Mr Swann said it will see more services offered on a regional basis, meaning patients may have to travel further for hospital appointments and operations.The health minister said he believed that a campaign had already started for a long-term commitment to the Downe Hospital, suggesting that it is ldquothis sort of language that then unnerves staff.The health minister said there was ldquonothing more unnerving than social media campaigns for the people who are working in our health service at this minute in time about saving their hospital when their hospital is not under threat.Mr Swann said the health service did not have enough staff and needed more, insisting that ldquonobody is going to be done away with.The health minister added: ldquoWe donrsquot have a big enough footprint so we need every square foot that we have, but it may not be that everybody gets every service that they want delivered on their doorstep..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Danny.jpg","title":"Danny wins jockeys’ title  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK native Danny McMenamin crowned a great season on Saturday at Sandown Park when he was presented with his trophy as thechampion conditional jockey, finishing well clear of his closest rivals.He becomes the latest Northern Ireland jockey to land the title and he was full of praise for Anthony Dobbin, who was responsible for him joining the stable of Nicky Richards, and to his coach, Richardsrsquo former stable jockey, Cork-born Brian Harding.With Downpatrickrsquos next meeting due on May , it would be niceDanny was offered some rides at the venue.

Firefighters also used back pack sprayers but the majority had to use shovels and beaters to tackle the fire in harsh conditions.The environmental impact of the blaze mdash which could be seen up to  miles away mdash is immeasurable as work now starts to draw up plans up for a major conservation restoration programme following the loss of precious wildle habitats.National Trust officials who have surveyed the scale of the damage say they have never seen anything like it before, describing parts of the mountain range as resembling a ldquolunar landscape, estimating that the once rich habitat could take up to five years to recover.Over  firefighters were involved in the battle to contain the blaze with dramatic images captured last Friday night illustrating the scale of the task they faced and making the front pages of major UK newspapers.The following morning, the Fire and Rescue Service declared a major incident as the battle to contain the fire which was destroying everything in its path was ramped up, with firefighters from across Northern Ireland helping out.Firefighters have also been praised for preventing the wildfire from reaching Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes by using a blanket of foam as part of a fire break.When the flames were finally put out late on Sunday afternoon, exhausted firefighters who had to carry their equipment to remote locations began to pack up toto their bases after spending many hours working in challenging conditions.One of the driest Aprils on record increased the risk and challenges for those tackling the huge gorse fire with a blanket of smoke engulfing the spectacular mountain range, with the emergency response involving Coastguard helicopters from Dublin and Prestwick which airlted senior fire chiefs to provide them with an aerial view of the raging inferno so they could plan the on-the-ground response.Keen to do its part, the Newcastle community stepped up to help donating food and drink to the emergency services with an appeal launched by schoolboy Charlie Thompson raising over pound, to thank firefighters for their efforts.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots and health minister Robin Swann were both in Newcastle last weekend to thank firefighters for the work they were doing with senior fire chiefs appealing to people to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.Mr Poots confirmed that the damage to the arearsquos rich bioersity spread over three and a half square kilometres could potentially take years to recover and said he was ldquoheart-broken and sickened by the events which unfolded last Friday night.ldquoIt is hard to grasp the scale of the fire and the devastation that occurred. While we do not know the full scale of the impact of the fire at this stage, we do know that it will be signicant for the environment and tourism economy that thrives on the unique natural beauty of this renowned area, he added.South Down MP Chris Hazzard described images of the fire encircling the Mournes as ldquoshocking and said confirmation the blaze was deliberate ldquosickens you to the heart of your stomach someone would be so reckless to skulk about in the middle of the night to set fire ti such a precious environmental habitat.He declared: ldquoMake no mistake, these arsonists should be dealt with in the exact same way asthey had set fire to a public building.Mr Hazzard also said it was not enough for the environment minister to ldquomaybe introduce fines for such behaviour.He said there was also a need for better management of the Mournes, highlighting the need for increased finances to be provided to the Mourne Heritage Trust and Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them deal with a ldquoreally sensitive and fragile environment.Meanwhile fire chiefs say everyone must work hard to prevent fires like those which ravaged the Mournes last weekend from

A lot of parish centres have died a death and even the ones that are going well are finding things hard.Fr Murray said that several interesting items were found in the buildings stores when they were clearing it out.ldquoDownpatrick Silver and Reed Band used to rehearse in the hall and we found a baton and a drum. We gave the drum to Fr Brendan Smyth, the parish priest in Crossgar, as his father banged that drum and he was delighted to have received it, he said.ldquoAlso, we found a lovely statue of St Joseph which was over  years old and had been well fixed to a wall at the back of the building. We removed it and itrsquos now standing in front of St Patrickrsquos Church all brightly repainted.Fr Murray also mentioned the parishrsquos hope that a suitable arrangement would be found for the former Sisters of Mercy convent which sits beside St Patrickrsquos Church.The Sisters of Mercy Congregation gave the building to Sr Consilio, which runs the Cuan Mhuire addiction recovery centre in Newry, in . However, St Consilio decided last year that it was unable to take on the Downpatrick building on along with its other commitments and offered it to the parish.Fr Murray said: ldquoThere are still ongoing discussions within the parish about the convent. However, we would hope that whatever happens with the convent building that it will be in keeping and in harmony with neighbouring our church..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Scene.jpg","title":"Scene ‘deeply distressing’  ","story":"THE dramatic images of the Mournes burning on Friday evening sparked an immediate response from senior politicians who expressed shock at the photographs they were witnessing.First Minister Arlene Foster tweeted ldquothis is devastating and tragic and the impact on wildle and flora is unimaginable while Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill thanked the emergency services for all they were doing to ldquoprotect the beauty of the Mournes and save wildle.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis described the scenes in the Mournes as ldquodeeply distressing at one of the regionrsquos most beautul landmarks and also paid tribute to the firefighters at the scene.Local political condemnation has been led by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, MLAs and local councillors.Mr Hazzard said the community was both ldquoshocked and angry at the impact of the blaze on a popular spot with visitors, particularly after the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoPeople will have seen the shocking images the Mournes looked like a range of volcanos that were erupting, he said.ldquoThere was shock, but also anger in the community that here we are again, another event we have to deal with. Obviously we have been dealing with Covid-, but there was also a large flood last year in Newcastle and now wersquore going to have to pick up the pieces after the fire.ldquoTherersquos not too many people who go into the Mournes a am on a Friday morning for a barbecue, he declared. ldquoWhat we need to see now is a moratorium on all gorse burning right across the island.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he believed legislators need to ensure that structures are put in place to prevent such a devastating fire from happening again, highlighting the need for an an all-island strategy to address wildfires, with the focus on how they can be prevented and how people can be educated better about land management.Paying tribute to the bravery and determination of those tackling the blaze, he said he feared the huge fire will not only have a devastating impact on the natural landscape, but also the Newcastle economy that relies so heavily on tourism associated with the Mournes.ldquoHaving met with the Fire and Rescue Service it is clear that they are doing everything they can to combat these blazes. However, the issue of gorse and wildfires is something that affects our entire island and our response to it cannot just be a reaction to every outbreak of fire but a measured response that attempts to understand why these fires are happening so often and ultimately to prevent them, he continued.ldquoThat is why I tabled an oral question at the Assembly on Monday to the Health Minister asking for an all-island strategy to specically address the prevention, response, post investigation analysis of such fires and,necessary, what repercussions there would be for those who perpetrate these fires.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWhile gorse and wildfires do not recognise borders, they do recognise barriers. We have seen instances in the past where the blocking of land masses has ensured that fires were not able to get a grasp where they would have caused untold damage had this not been the case.Slieve Croob councillor Andy McMurray also thanked firefighters and revealed that he watched the fire spread from the Glen Fofanny area, across Leganabruchan and Millstone on Friday evening towards Thomasrsquos Mountain which was ldquoencircled in apocalyptic flames.He said the fact the fire covered such a distance underlines the intense ferocity of the blaze and seeing how close it came to the boundary of Donard Forest really puts into perspective the work of all those involved in the emergency response.Cllr McMurray said he took time off work last Friday morning to do a litter pick along the Bloody Bridge River and collected a number of discarded barbecues.He continued: ldquoThat people are taking these into the hills in the first place is a nonsense. But to do so during such a dry spell as we are experiencing and then only to leave them behind is just the height of irresponsibility and ignorance.ldquoThere are many factors which give rise to the wildfire scenario we have found ourselves in. The reality is that we have experienced this before only a few years ago in Tullybrannigan and last year at Dollyrsquos Brae near Castlewellan.Cllr McMurray said emergency and local agencies needed to receive support from Stormont andWestminster to be in position to regularly deal and investigate fires which are ldquocrimes against our natural habitat and need to be forensically examined in order establish responsibility.He added: ldquoFrom there, due process should be followed while in the longer term there is a need to explorethere are environmental management strategies which can be adopted to reduce the chances of such events happening.Mournes councillor Glyn Hanna has spoken of his shock at seeing images of the wildfires.He said he feared it may take years for the Mournes to recover from the devastation.ldquoThe images of fire on the mountains reminded me of similar pictures of lava flowing from volcanoes in Iceland, he said.ldquoThe images of Donard were just shocking, andthis was started deliberately then whoever did it should be ashamed.ldquoStarting fires on the mountains is no joke and is nothing more than a criminal act putting people in danger for no reason, Cllr Hanna added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/28April2021-Super.jpg","title":"Super supporter John signs off 18th book on Manchester United  ","story":"CARRYDUFF Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club branch secretary John White has released his th book about his beloved team.lsquoManchester United ndash The Making of a Football Dynastyrsquo is the latest instalment of Johnrsquos impressive book series in which he reviews the story behind  of their past matches.This book is part of a two volume set, with  games being detailed in each.The games could be substantial for a number of reasons, such as a notable playerrsquos debut, a record scoreline, a controversial moment and so on.ldquoThis is a book which will teach United fans the history of the club in a way that has never been approached before, said John.ldquoThere is a lot of interesting trivia mixed-in about players, the opposition, the competition and I end every game with a special did you know that The author insists this isnrsquot a ldquoglory glory Manchester United book, but rather it is one of ldquoovercoming adversity and learning.The Red Devils super-fan began writing about his favourite team whilst travelling to matches with the cross-community supportersrsquo club  years ago.

Mr. Poots is calling the document his Manesto for Reform and indeed, the opening line includes both the words \"revitalise\" and \"rebuild\".A few paragraphs later Mr. Poots says the DUP must be \"restructured and re-energised\" and confirmed thatelected he will separate the position of leader and First Minister for Northern Ireland stating \"one person cannot do justice to both demanding jobs\".If successful, Mr. Poots says he would use his position as party leader to \"oversee the work of a new ministerial team and the day-to-day management of the party\".Mr. Poots goes on to tell his fellow party members that one of his main priorities as leader would be to give a \"resounding response\" to any suggestion of a border poll on Irish unity.Mr. Poots also claims he has a \"plan that will transform the DUP structure and s\" but offers no details on what his plan will look like.In terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Mr. Poots sets out an action plan in which he says he would work to \"systematically undermine and strip away all aspects of it\".Engagement across all levels of unionism and loyalism is also high on Mr. Poots list of priorities.Mr. Poots says he would also launch pro-union initiatives that would include: a Unionist convention of poltical and civil unionism a pro-union strategic think tank that would work towards building support for the union and thereby avoid a border poll.The current Agriculture Minister also says he would set-up a pro-union foundation which would support initiatives designed to strengthen the union.In the final section of the manesto, Mr. Poots sets out his priorities for both the DUP as a party and his priorities for government.In terms of priorities for the party, Mr. Poots lists implementation of his Manesto for Reform as his number one objective.An independent review of the DUP would also be one of Mr. Poots prioritieselected leader and he says he would also want to see \"internal DUP engagement with every Association\".Concerning his priorities for government Mr. Poots says as DUP leader he would seek to expose \"republican propaganda and shameless populism\".Mr. Poots also says he will oversee the DUPs new ministerial team and develop a strategy to see the development of \"DUP initiatives covering all aspects of devolved government\".The manesto ends with a pledge to improve the effectiveness between elected DUP representatives in Stormont and Westminster.---A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

One person simply can’t do justice to both demanding jobs. Each job demands % from the office holder.”That decision means that Mr Poots, unlike his predecessors, will not receive a larger salary from the DUP leadership – the first minister’s position attracts a salary of £,.Mr Poots said that he had a plan “that will transform the DUP structures and s”, suggesting that he has been planning this move for some time.He went on: “From top to bottom, we have to drive up transparency.

Listen to what members say...as leader, I want to put ‘democracy’ back into the Democratic Unionist Party”.Mr Poots, who has not stopped his officials from building and then operating the Irish Sea border, pledged to “lead the campaign against the undemocratic protocol and systemically undermine and strip away all aspects of it”.The DUP veteran said that he would lead an “extensive outreach programme across unionism loyalism” and establish a unionist convention – a longstanding request of the UVF-linked PUP.He also promised a “pro-Union strategic think tank that includes academics, business figures, and civic and political unionism to broaden support for the Union to avoid a border poll”, as well as a “pro-Union foundation which will support projects designed to strengthen the Union” and international outreach “to better explain the unionist cause in Brussels, London and North America”.Some DUP sources backing Mr Poots’ campaign have said that he is planning to remove some of the party’s most powerful backroom figures such as chief executive Timothy Johnston, chief spin doctor John Robinson and Mrs Foster’s chief spad, Emma Little-Pengelly.However, a source within Mr Poots’ campaign yesterday said that it was “far from the case” that there would necessarily be a “clear out” and said that the iniduals named by others “are not targets”.:Sam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionGone without a fight: Arlene Foster walks away as DUP MLA says clear out of party’s top brass requiredSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forFarce as loyalist protest group claims credit for no one showing up to its protestSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestStill reeling from Boris Johnson’s betrayal, DUP founding member says he’s questioning the UnionSam McBride: A failure of unionist diplomacy has left it more isolated than for decadesLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for goodSam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it down——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

Unlike many other retailers, Poundland had a relatively steady  in the face of coronavirus restrictions, thanks in part toits status as an essential retailer and strong demand for expanded clothing and homewares ranges.It opted to temporarily close certain sites despite being allowed to remain open, and said sales among stores that traded throughoutthe year rose.In October, it bought frozen food retailer Fultons Foods as it looks to ramp up its food offering, and hasaccelerated the roll-out of chilled and frozen food to  stores.Barry Williams, Poundland managing director, said: ldquoThis is the biggest transformation in our history as we look to secure our future for another  years.Earlier this month, the owner of Poundland announced plans to list its shares in Warsaw instead of London, in its multibillion-pound stock market float.Pepco, which also runs the PepCo and Dealz brands, had previously said that it was considering stock exchanges in the UK and Poland.The listing price and total valuation has not yet been disclosed, although it is reported by Sky to be worth about pound billion.Pepco trades from , stores across  European countries, including more than , stores in Poland.A version of this article originally appeared on our sister title, NationalWorldGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

No. claimed the ‘short, controlled procession’ was followed by a large police presence including eight police vehicles and ‘no less than three police cameramen videographers.However the PSNI pointed out that the Health Protection Regulations remain in place adding: “It is important that people continue to adhere to them.” Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor said: “Police were in attendance at a notied parade at Main Street in Markethill on Monday rd May.PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“In relation to potential breaches of the Health ProtectionRegulations NI , warnings were given and an evidence gathering operation put in place. We will now review all the footage gathered.”In a statement on Facebook the Lodge said Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band had concerns prior to the event as the Parades Commission had classied the parade as ‘sensitive’.On top of issues with the Parades Commission, which had determined the parade legal, the Lodge described the actions of the PSNI as ‘intimidatory’.“Before this short, controlled procession began several police officers began to gather around the band. No less than three police cameramen videographers were focused directly on the band. As they formed to start parading, a loudspeaker rang out directly at the side of the band. They were informed that they must disperse! PSNI officers at the Markethill Protestant Boys Flute Band parade in the town to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland, on May , .“As they moved off, several PSNI cameramen followed the parade akin to the ‘blocks’ of soldiers some will remember from past bad days. One PSNI cameraman continued to take  video for about half of the procession.“If that were not intimidating enough, it was observed that there were at least, at least eight marked police vehicles present in and in the vicinity of the town!“Tonight’s events are deeply disturbing for many in the local community. Over and above all Parades Commission and Covid related issuesthe proportionality observed this evening is hugely concerning. To have this single band of young men, women and children videoed and photographed in what many would consider as an overtly intimidatory manner, is worrying enough, but to have eight police vehicles present for an event of a few dozen people is blatantly disproportionate! “What possible reasoning and justication can be given for such an approach  “These issues need immediately addressed. Our political representatives locally and beyond need to make representation now and get questions asked.“All efforts to get the PSNI to officially detail the restrictions upon legally notied parades and the related legislation in advance, have been ignored. We are in the situation that so-called ‘illegal’ protests are not permitted, travelling with legal events not being permitted! For any outsider it would appear that these exercises are not about the law or health. To any outsider it would appear we are in the midst of an attempt to ensure Unionism and Loyalism voices are silenced.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “The actions of the PSNI last night around a band parade in Markethill have further damaged confidence in policing within the Unionist community.“How it was thought that it would be a good idea to interfere in a small parade marking the centenary of NI in an overwhelmingly Protestant town well known for its parading culture is beyond me. It is certainly hard to square with the police approach to Republican funerals!“Outdoor band practices have been taking place across the country in full compliance with the law in recent days. Yesterday, in many parts of NI, inidual bands paraded in a manner which was compliant with the restrictions to mark NI’s th birthday without any interference from the police. Why was a dferent approach adopted in Markethill “It is important to note that this was a legal parade. Although it was marked as sensitive by the Parades Commission – a bizarre decision given the history of parading in the area – the organisers made every effort to keep within the law. This is, of course, in stark contrast with the actions of Republican lawmakers at a terrorist funeral last summer.“The issue is compounded by the fact that the PSNI were able to deploy no less than eight patrol cars and officers with cameras in an area where visible policing is often thin on the ground. “Frankly the PSNI need to take a hard look at how this matter was approached and the damage they have done to their image, not just in the Markethill area but across Northern Ireland.”  \"       \"  Most PopularLodge criticises policing of band parade celebrating NI centenaryJamie Bryson to address Markethill protest - urges next DUP leader to ‘break a little delph’New job transforms the le of dog lover JoshuaTeenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townAppeal to help locate ‘high risk’ missing personMost PopularLoyalists claim PSNI approach to Markethill parade was ‘intimidatory’ due to scale of officers filming and vehiclesApplication for eight new dwellingsWedding plans afootafter girlfriend said ‘yes’ to MLA’s proposalCouncil goes behind closed doorsMan due in court after £K of suspected heroin found in NI town                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\" ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kafWEX sc-feJyhm dbjzDR\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"     LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFollow us          "},{"url":null,"title":"application for eight new dwellings ","story":"Minister visits town as restrictions eased   Teenage girl taken to hospital after crash in NI townNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsApplication for eight new dwellingsA planning application has been submitted that,successful, will bring eight semi-detached dwellings to Portadown.By The NewsroomWednesday, th May , : am  \"       \"  Agent Gray Design Ltd has submitted an application on behalf of applicantManx, to bring eight, three bedroom, semi-detached properties to a site m NW of no  Ballybay Meadows, off the Loughgall Road.The . hectare site is currently identied as vacant development land, says the land is not in a flood plain and that the surface water created by the development will be disposed of via the mains.Submitted on Monday, March , the application was validated on Monday, April .The neighbour consultation period expires on Wednesday, May , while the standard consultationperiod expires on Monday, May .

Had these been paid for, as they would have been in the   financial year, this could have generated £, for Council.Speaking at March’s meeting of Council’s environmental services committee, Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience, accepted  was not a “normal year” for data on the use of the service to be collected.Although he did note that prior to the introduction of free bulky waste collections, the service had been generating £-, in revenue for Council.SDLP Councillor Ciaran Toman made a proposal at that meeting for officers to bring a report back to the committee on the possibility of an extension of the fee free bulky waste collection service.The proposal was seconded by his party colleague, Councillor Thomas Larkham.Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service this week, Cllr Toman welcomed the working group’s ability to speak with one voice on this matter.“It has been a tough year for everyone,” said Cllr Toman. “While Council carried out , bulky waste collections over the past year, the recorded fly-tipping incidents jumped from  in   to  in  .“This suggests some form of direct correlation between the closing of our recycling centres and the postponed bulky waste collections which were affected by the pandemic.“I very much see bulky waste collections as an essential service in Council’s efforts to tackle fly-tipping and keeping our streets and countryside clean.“I am pleased there was unanimous agreement to maintain the system as it is, fee-free and review it again in a further  months.”Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
